**Why did the Supreme Court delay the decision on the disclosure of
Trump\'s finances?**

This is an extremely important case, and it deserves to be handled with
the utmost of care.

Trump's presidency is unique because Trump is not a politician and his
finances affects more than just himself. He has companies in his name,
and his family's and others' finances are also directly related to his
finances. Disclosure of those finances, for political purposes, can cost
his companies many millions of dollars.

Trump is also the first modern president who has not voluntarily
released his financial information. This lack of candor has rankled his
political opponents, who truly believe that he is only withholding his
personal financial information because he has something to hide.

The Court will be determining the scope of the separation-of-powers
doctrine which is part of the design of the Constitution. It will
determine the limits of Congressional oversight; in other words, how far
can Congress go into investigating the financial history of a president
before he became president. This decision affects not only Trump, but
every other president to follow, so it is very important.

This is why the court is moving slowly and deliberately.
