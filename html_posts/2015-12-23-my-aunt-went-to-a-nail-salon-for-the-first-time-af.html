This sounds like a great question to ask a personal injury attorney. The
ones you see on TV usually focus on car accidents, but there are copious
quantities of personal injury attorneys who can assist you. In many
cases, their initial consultation is free.

A settlement would account for the medical costs, pain and suffering,
and any potential losses which can be articulated due to the cancer.
