**Where are any details of substantive proof or even probability in
Republicans screaming that the FBI is crooked and Mueller should be
impeached?**

There is much substantive proof, but it's not that the FBI is "crooked."
It's that the FBI has more than just "bias." It's that the FBI has
***impeachable bias***. Now, "impeachment" in this term is not the
impeachment we are discussing where Congress removes an elected official
from their position. It's the impeachment that we talk about when we use
evidence to refute the character of a witness. It's called "impeachment
evidence."

And in the case of the Mueller probe, there's *a lot* of it. He has more
than just "bias" on his team against Trump. He has lawyers who have
actually represented members of the Clinton team. He has tweets from
lead investigators expressing extreme anti-Trump sentiments and implying
that they might use their position on the investigation team as an
"insurance policy" against a continued Trump presidency. He has people
with close ties (i.e. spouses who directly worked for) the opposition
research firm which wrote the mostly false anti-Trump dossier.

And Mueller's investigation, and how it has been handled, is very
suspect, despite his "well-known" reputation for thoroughness. Besides
his poor choice of investigators, he obtained government emails without
a warrant. Could he legally do this? Potentially, but it just offers
another line item the opposition can use against him. It's easy for him
to obtain warrants; why not do this? It just gives the opposition
something more to use in court: attacking the legality of the email
seizure.

However, the most important misstep in the whole Mueller probe
essentially means that there won't be any substantive indictments coming
from this investigation. Why? Back to that "impeachment evidence," which
the opposition gets to see during the discovery phase of the
investigation, and which the Mueller team is required by law to
disclose. This means that the FBI will be forced to air all of its dirty
laundry, and because you had an agent like Peter Strzok as the primary
interrogator during both the Clinton investigation and the Flynn
investigation, lots of things about the FBI and the credibility of its
agents will come to light, and the FBI doesn't want that. As the "the
great bastion of fairness and impartiality" in America, as the FBI likes
to bill itself, it doesn't want to be seen holding biases against the
people it is investigating. It would be very damaging to the credibility
of the FBI for Mueller to bring charges against anyone and have all of
this evidence come to light.

Finally, Mueller can't be "impeached," he's not an elected official.
He's an appointed official who can be fired. Trump *could* legally fire
Mueller, but he won't. Trump has Mueller right where he wants him. The
Mueller probe was uncharacteristically sloppily handled, its credibility
is paper-thin and fairly easily impeachable, and it is extremely
unlikely to produce anything of substance. It's best to just let it die.
Let the Democrats hang on to the false Russia collusion narrative,
because the longer they do, the more irrelevant they make themselves
look, and the more good things Republicans can continue to get done
while they're distracted from opposing them.
