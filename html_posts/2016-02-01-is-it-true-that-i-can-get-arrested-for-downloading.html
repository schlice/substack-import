You don\'t get arrested for using Torrent. Torrent (or BitTorrent, to be
more precise), is just a file copy protocol which very efficiently moves
files around the Internet.

You get arrested for downloading licensed content for which you do not
have a license.

For example, if a Torrent site offers you free movies and free music
(which are not part of the public domain), and other sites charge for
those, either through subscription fees or per-song fees, then it\'s
likely that the site is ***stealing*** the content. It would be illegal
for you to download that content, either through BitTorrent, FTP, HTTP,
or whatever file transfer protocol you choose.

Is it likely that they will go after you? No. And it\'s also not likely
that they would be able to tell from a file on your computer from where
you got it. For example, I have several hundred movies ripped from DVDs
and saved on a hard drive which I take with me when I travel. It\'s very
convenient. But you\'ll note that I have all of the originals boxed up
in my basement. This would constitute *fair use* since I am only using
one copy of the movie at a time, and I only breached the copy protection
to convert the movie to a format that fit my specific hardware. Yes, I
had to circumvent copy protection in order to copy the movie which is
technically illegal, but I am protected by fair use, and I doubt anyone
will go after me directly anyway. If they did, I am certain that I could
make a strong argument for fair use.

As for you, if you have movies or music on your laptop, I think you\'ll
be just fine bringing them anywhere you choose. The legality of those
movies may be in question (I have no way of knowing), but your personal
use of those movies or music shouldn\'t raise any red flags.

I would avoid using BitTorrent to download illegally copied content
while you are stateside. I\'d also avoid using BitTorrent to download
illegally copied content *any time*, but I\'ll leave that judgment call
to you.

Finally, no, they will not stop you at the airport to check your laptop
for illegal content. They are not the content police, they are the TSA.
Not to mention, they can\'t check your laptop without a warrant. You\'ll
be just fine. Have fun in New York; I grew up there. The phrase \"the
city that never sleeps\" is absolutely true.

(EDIT) A commenter posted that US Customs and Border Patrol (USCBP) can
actually check your laptop, and while I was talking about TSA
domestically around the US, the commenter is correct in saying that
USCBP can check your laptop, including all of the data on it, as you
cross the border. They can also seize your laptop. But just having a
digital copy of a movie on your laptop doesn't mean that you illegally
obtained it. As I indicated above, I would be covered under "fair use"
if I was ever stopped with my movies going through Customs. But the CBP
agents don't know that, so I'd have a hard time believing that I'd be
stopped or have my laptop seized because of those movies.

Honestly, it's going to be up to you. If you legally obtained the media
on your laptop, then go for it. But if you didn't, you probably
shouldn't carry it through Customs into any foreign country, as their
laws are different from your home laws. They can indeed search your
laptop at the border, and they can seize it as well. And as a foreigner,
if they see you as being uncooperative, they can deny you entry into the
US. Don't risk that.
