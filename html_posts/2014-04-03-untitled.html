<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [\> when we remove the tests and intrusion from
heterosexuals in determining the ability to conceive (which already
exists in lots of ways today), why, using your logic, do they not lose
the right to marriage as you expect gays to?\
\
There are two questions there. First, you said that \"I expect gays to
LOSE the right to marriage\" implying I expect them to lose a right they
already possess, which is not true. This right never existed, for all of
the reasons we already described.\
\
Secondly, the methods by which we determine whether or not a couple is
fertile is not at question. Be it easy or hard, intrusive or plainly
visible, the couple\'s fertility or ability to have children is not part
of the equation. Your answer reveals that you missed the point. Let me
try to make it more clear.\
\
1. Evidence, both scientific and anecdotal, reveals that children have
the **BEST** chance for success in life (not the only chance, but the
best one) if they are raised in a single household with their biological
parents. Dispute this if you must, but the state currently believes the
evidence it has, and so does the majority of society, otherwise this law
would have been easily overturned everywhere.\
\
2. The state has an overriding interest in protecting the welfare of
children. Doing whatever it can to benefit children is a state
interest.\
\
So, to recap what I just said, children are best raised in a house with
their biological parents. The state has an overriding interest in
providing what\'s best for children. Therefore, the state incentivizes
the familial configuration that provides the best possible outcome for
children (not the only one, just the best one). Other factors are not
considered, regardless of how easy or difficult it is to tell whether or
not someone is able to have children. The law has never been oriented in
this way. The focus is the children, and encouraging adults to arrange
their lives in such a way to provide the best possible outcome for
children. The law has always been oriented in this way.\
\
If such a time comes that two men or two women, without a great deal of
medical intervention, can easily produce children, AND it is found that
such a familial arrangement produces children with a better chance of
success than traditional family configurations, the marriage law should
be revisited. Until then, and assuming that all of the above is still
true, changing the marriage law does not benefit children. And since the
law is about children, a change in the law must benefit children.\
\
Therefore, the law follows what\'s best for children, so if the evidence
shows that children of same-sex couples have a better chance of success
in life than heterosexual couples, the law would have to change to
incentivize that relationship. However, it would be a very long and
arduous process to reprogram generations of people to believe this is
true, despite the biological evidence and the anthropological ideas
which believe that human beings were created in two sexes because there
are benefits to children from both a mother and a father. Otherwise, why
have two sexes at all, anthropologically?]{.rendered_qtext}
