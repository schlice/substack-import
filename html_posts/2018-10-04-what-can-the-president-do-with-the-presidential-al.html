**What can the President do with the Presidential Alert function on my
phone other than show messages?**

It seems that people have the false notion that the President can use
WEA in the same way he uses Twitter. Let's dispel some myths, shall we?

1.  "The President" by himself cannot activate the Emergency Alert
    System (EAS) and its component system, the Wireless Emergency Alert
    (WEA) network.\
    \
    The network is activated in conjunction with the FCC, FEMA, and
    NOAA, and can only be used as a "last-ditch" communication measure
    when the President cannot reach the media, during a national
    emergency.\
    \
    For example, the system was not engaged during the last national
    emergency, September 11th, 2001, because the agencies determined
    that the media was fully conveying all relevant information without
    the need to activate EAS or WEA.
2.  WEA, despite claims to the contrary, cannot control your phone. It
    can't activate your microphone. It can't access your location. It
    can't activate any functionality that E911 can. Essentially, it's
    nothing more than a text message. Your phone receives it. It
    displays the message. That's about the extent of it.
