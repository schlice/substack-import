Short answer: no.

Longer answer: Once your initial contract term is up (which was up long
ago), you are essentially on a "month-to-month" contract. This contract
can be modified or terminated by either party at any time.

Verizon had been providing its "grandfathered" plans as a gesture of
goodwill, not simply pulling the rug out from under you, since you were
working well on the old plans. The time in your grandfathered plan was
intended for you to be used to find a new plan that would work for you.

But there comes a point in time when the old plans simply don't work in
the new infrastructure. Backend equipment changes, and to be fair,
wireless carriers are no longer "tooled" for unlimited data. They are
tooled for unlimited voice and text, and metered data.

Why?

Data sells. The money is in data. They can offer phone calls and texting
for pennies (or simply wrap it into your service when you buy a
qualifying data plan). But the money is in data now. More people use
data consistently than use voice or text, orders of magnitude more.
While SMS is popular, phone companies have always known that charging
large amounts of money for texts or limiting texts was a poor business
decision, as SMS is literally dirt cheap for the carrier. Plus, with
more and more people demanding more and more data (well, not directly,
but their apps which use data chew up continually more bandwidth) and
smartphones becoming the norm, with even low-end phones as entry-level
smartphones, data is at a premium. The infrastructure has to go to data,
and the money has to go to data.

You can't have seen this change happening and not known that your
unlimited plan was not long for this world.

Legally, you weren't under a contract. Your contract with Verizon ended
at the end of the contract term, which was long ago (I'm guessing
several years). Supporting the equipment which still supported your
likely older hardware and your older plan configuration gets expensive.

In product support, we generally only support N-1 versions of a product.
That means we support the current GA (general availability) hardware,
and one hardware family previous. Once we pass that point, you can
continue to use the old hardware, but support options become far more
limited. We simply can't support all the old stuff and continue to
provide the new services the vast majority of our customer base demands.

Sooner or later, it was inevitable that Verizon was going to tell the
remaining monthly non-contract users that it was time to switch.

My advice? Switch to T-Mobile. They will slow your data speed once you
pass the amount of data you paid for, but you will still have data, and
you won't pay for overages. Plus, they don't count most of the big-use
data that are so popular these days. They don't count video streaming
services, they don't count music streaming services, and for the next
year at least, all of your Pokemon GO data is free.

So there's that.
