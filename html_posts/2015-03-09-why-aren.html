**Content:** [You\'re not obligated to declare against yourself in a
police investigation either. You are just held under a different
standard.\
\
The 5th Amendment states (the important part highlighted), \"No person
shall be held to answer **for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime**,
unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury, except in cases
arising in the land or naval forces, or in the militia, when in actual
service in time of war or public danger; nor shall any person be subject
for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; **nor
shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against
himself**, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due
process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use,
without just compensation.\"\
\
There\'s a lot of different things in there (the Double Jeopardy clause,
the Due Process clause, etc), but the important one is the one that
protects you against self-incrimination.\
\
In a police investigation, you are protected by the ruling in *Miranda v
Arizona*, commonly referred to as the *Miranda* rule. It says you don\'t
have to make any statements, but anything you do say will be used
against you in court. In a police investigation, you haven\'t yet been
charged with a crime, so the 5th Amendment does not apply, because you
haven\'t been held to answer for a crime yet. That\'s why the Miranda
ruling is so important.\
\
In a courtroom, your statements are protected by the 5th Amendment,
which protects you from self-incrimination. At this point, you\'ve
already been charged with a crime, so the 5th Amendment
applies.]{.rendered_qtext}
