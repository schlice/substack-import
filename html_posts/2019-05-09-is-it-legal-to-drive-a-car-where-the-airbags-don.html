**Is it legal to drive a car where the airbags don't work?**

Airbags are a "supplemental" restraint system.

Your "primary" restraint system is seat belts. You are required to wear
seat belts when you drive a car; therefore (with a few limited
exceptions), you cannot drive a car with no seat belts.

However, as long as your car has seat belts, you can drive a car with no
airbags.
