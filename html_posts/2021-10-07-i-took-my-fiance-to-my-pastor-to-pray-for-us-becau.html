Shake the dust of that church off of your feet and leave.

Let's be fair: your pastor was probably injecting his personal opinion
about the young man into his guidance, but he did it in the most
absolutely wrong way. The pastor can not tell you what the will of God
is. He doesn't know. No one knows. And if he says he knows, he should
probably get back into Scripture sometime soon.

God's mind is "unsearchable" and "unknowable". Who has known the mind of
God? Not any of us, that's for sure. Unless God chooses to reveal his
plans to us (which he does not often do), the knowledge of those plans
will likely stay out of reach.

Find a better church, and congratulations on your pending marriage!
Keeping your marriage grounded in your faith is the number one thing you
can do to ensure a long and happy life together.

And if it helps you to know, I'll be praying for you too.

I took my fiancé to my pastor to pray for us because we want to get
married and the pastor said he is not the will of God for me and I love
him. What should I do?
