How can you be an atheist but believe in God? That sounds like living a
lie. It sounds like living a life of duplicity, not being true to
yourself.

Being able to live with such cognitive dissonance is not a sign of
goodness, but of mental instability.

I would not characterize such a person as a "good person."
