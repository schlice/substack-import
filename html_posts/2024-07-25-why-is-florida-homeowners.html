This is an interesting case, and it has to do with what is known as
"Kaufman language." Kaufman language for HOAs is the inclusion of a
single phrase in Governing Documents:

> "This community shall be governed by Chapter 720 of the Florida
> Statutes as exists on the date hereof, and as same may be amended from
> time to time."

It stems from a 1977 Florida lawsuit, *Kaufman v. Shere*, which
essentially had the effect of incorporating \"substantive\" statutory
changes into the Governing Documents of a community. The judge ruled, in
part, that the Declaration by which the property was created and
governed had provided for the adoption of future legislative acts as
amendments to the declaration by including this phrase.

Absence of Kaufman Language allows (with some notable exceptions) that
the statute as it exists, on the date the governing documents are
recorded, will govern the substantive rights and duties of the parties.
Inclusion of Kaufman Language allows, in theory, that subsequent changes
in the law should be automatically available.

Basically, some Florida HOAs are pushing back on the new amendments to
Florida law directing HOAs that they must allow trucks to park in
driveways. They are saying that, since their Governing Documents do not
include "Kaufman language," then homeowners accepted the rules ***as
they existed on the date the Governing Documents were recorded.***

In other words, the HOA is *grandfathered* in.

The question of whether or not HOAs can do this will have to be
determined by the courts. In other words, a homeowner will have to park
a truck, the HOA will have to fine the homeowner, and the homeowner will
have to file suit against the HOA, claiming that the fine violates the
new Florida Statute. The HOA will argue that because their Governing
Documents do not contain Kaufman language, the HOA is grandfathered in,
and their Governing Documents do not include the new additions or
modifications to State law.

We shall see how this shakes out.
