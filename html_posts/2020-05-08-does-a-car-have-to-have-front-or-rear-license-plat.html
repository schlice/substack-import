**Does a car have to have front or rear license plates?**

Depends on the state. When you register your car in your state, you get
either one (rear) or two (front and rear) license plates.

In other words, if you've received one plate from your DMV, it's most
likely that you only need one. If you've received two, you need two.

If you're unsure, consult the friendly personnel in your local DMV
office when you register your car.

And I'm serious about the *friendly* thing; my DMV office is cool. I
know, no one ever in the history of ever has said that DMV offices are
cool, but this one is.
