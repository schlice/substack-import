**What exactly is involved in the \"universal background checks\" that
gun control advocates want?**

Look at Colorado, which recently implemented universal background checks
at the state level.

Basically, universal background checks means **any time a firearm
changes ownership, a background check must be performed, no
exceptions.**

Buying or selling a private firearm? Background checks. We didn't need
to do this previously under state law, so this might be the only area
where such a law is beneficial. Private party sales. But we'll come back
to the only potentially useful scenario later.

However, implementing UBCs without exceptions opens up a whole series of
problems.

- Gifting a firearm to a family member? Background checks. That's right,
  if I bought that pretty pink M&P Shield for my wife, I have to do a
  background check on her. Or if I bought a Henry rifle for my son on
  his 18th birthday, I have to do a background check on him. Does this
  sound reasonable?
- One year while I was living in Colorado, my house was placed under
  pre-evacuation orders due to wildfire. I gave my firearms to my friend
  to place in his gun safe for safe keeping, which worked out great.
  Incidentally, I did the same for him when his own house was under
  evacuation orders for a different wildfire. Under the UBC law, I would
  have to do a background check on him before he can take my firearms to
  store them, even in an emergency.

Administratively, this becomes a nightmare. How long do I have to retain
the record of the background check? How long do I have to retain the
record of the sale? Who gets punished if the background check wasn't
done? Who is going to follow up on all of these violations of the law?
The police? Sure, they've got plenty of extra time to take care of that.
And finally, I can't do background checks on my own; I need someone with
a Federal Firearms License (FFL) to do the check for me. Great for
business for local FFLs, but now any gun sale costs me more because I
have to do a background check, and FFLs charge money to do a background
check. Which means that all guns now cost incrementally more, which
means we put the burden on the segment of society that needs cost
increases the least: the poor. This law effectively may price the poor
out of the gun market, which means that the law effectively denies them
the ability to exercise their rights.

State data for the states which have implemented universal background
checks shows that the checks have done nothing to stem the rise in
homicides. Delaware saw a significant increase in background checks, but
also saw its homicide rate significantly increase as well; from 4.4 in
2013 to a 30-year high of 6.6 in 2015, before dropping slightly to 5.9
in 2016. Colorado saw a modest increase in background checks, but also
saw an increase in homicides, 3.3 to 3.7. In all the states studied
which implemented universal background checks, they saw increases in
homicide rates.[\[1\]](#NebqW){#cite-NebqW .citation_link}

It's almost as if background checks had no effect at all.

Maybe it's because the people who are complying with background checks
are not the people committing crimes. Criminals aren't buying their guns
from people who are going to conduct background checks. Instead of
focusing our time on getting tougher on gun crimes and the people who
commit them, we instead go after people who are already following the
law. Does that seem right to you?
