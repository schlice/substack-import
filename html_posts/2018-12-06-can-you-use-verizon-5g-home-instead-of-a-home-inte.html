**Can you use Verizon 5G Home instead of a home internet service
provider, such as Spectrum?**

Verizon 5G Home is, specifically, home internet service. It is designed
to replace your traditional home internet service provider (ISP). It's
all pretty pie-in-the-sky on their website, as it is currently in a
limited-availability rollout, As of today (6 Dec 2018), the service is
only available in Los Angeles, Sacramento, Houston, and Indianapolis.
They are offering free equipment rental, free service for the first
three months, free upgrades, and no data caps. Speeds are supposed to be
around 300 Mbps. For comparison, I have Xfinity (cable) and I pull
around 175 Mbps down.

Pricing is currently set at a fixed \$70/mo if you're not a Verizon
Wireless customer, and \$50/mo if you have at least one line of Verizon
Wireless (mobile smartphone) service on your account. It has to be a
minimum of a \$30/mo mobile plan, and data-only plans do not count. So
if you're already rocking a Verizon smartphone, you could get this
wireless home internet service for an added \$50/mo, and no data caps,
and speeds which purportedly are double what you can achieve with
traditional cable.

It will be interesting to see if this can scale and if they can actually
deliver the speeds and the bandwidth they promise.
