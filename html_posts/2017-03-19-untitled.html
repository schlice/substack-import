My dad worked for Nassau County PD (east of NYC, on Long Island). I
watched him assist several local doctors and business owners get their
permits. So I know that with police assistance, it can be done, and
relatively easily. In New York, you do need a reason to get one, and
it\'s up to the chief of police to determine if your reason is good
enough. There are also pretty stringent registration requirements for
your firearms.

This was 25 years ago though; I can\'t speak to how easy it is today.
