**Content:** [Suspended basically means not actively being worked, but
not closed. If new evidence is introduced or discovered, the case may
become active again.\
\
After a set period of time, the case will go \"cold\" and will be
archived. It is still not closed. If the crime has a statute of
limitations, the case will be closed when the crime hits its date of
statute.]{.rendered_qtext}
