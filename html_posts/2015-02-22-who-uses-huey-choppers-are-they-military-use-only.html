**Content:** [These Bell UH-1N Huey helicopters are operated by the 1st
Helicopter Squadron out of Joint Base Andrews in Maryland. The
helicopters you see are used exclusively for Distinguished Visitor (DV)
transport, and for one other specialized function: this is the unit
that, to this day, sits alert to evacuate the President, the First
Family, and key WH staffers, as well as some key Pentagon staffers, out
of the White House and the Pentagon and back to Andrews where they board
Air Force One or Air Force Two during a national emergency.\

I was privileged to fly an alert hop with these guys. Low level feet wet
over the Potomac, circle the White House, and back to Andrews. I also
got to fly on Air Force Two during my stay at Andrews, but because I
didn\'t have the necessary security clearance, I was not able to meet
the Vice President (Quayle) who was aboard. I had to stay in the
cockpit.
