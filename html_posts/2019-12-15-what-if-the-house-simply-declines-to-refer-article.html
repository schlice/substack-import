**What if the House declines to refer the Impeachment to the Senate
because most of the Republican \"jurors\" have already publicly declared
that the verdict, namely acquittal, has already been divided?**

So let me get this straight.

There is no consensus in the Congress that impeachable offenses have
even taken place, let alone what they are, so the House is questioning
whether or not they should pass Articles of Impeachment in the first
place, because there is zero chance of conviction in the Senate.

Is that your basic question?

If it is, then **the Impeachment process,** ***finally,*** **would be
working correctly.**

Impeachment requires *broad, bipartisan agreement* that impeachable
offenses have actually occurred. Then you can get down to the business
of deciding what they are, and all the little details, when you draw up
Articles of Impeachment.

This House put the cart before the horse. They drafted Articles without
even getting consensus that impeachable offenses have even taken place.
Now you have partisan Articles, and zero chance of conviction.

Logic would tell you to not bother with filling the Articles in the
first place. The supermajority in the Senate was designed to be that
necessary high bar for impeachment, grounding the "hot passions of the
day" in the House.

**TL;DR: The House should recognize that if they have no chance of
conviction, maybe there isn\'t as strong of a case for filing Articles
in the first place.**
