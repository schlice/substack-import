"Feeling like a tomboy" does not make you a boy. You're still a girl,
who likes to do things which were traditionally part of what boys do.

Note that you're claiming you shouldn't be put into a traditional gender
box, but your argument is that you "feel like a tomboy," which means
that you identify with things that are traditionally gender-based.

Your own argument is self-defeating.
