The value of your unit would be covered through your own homeowner's
insurance. This means that the real value of all of your possessions,
and the real value of the unit, would be repaid.

But that would simply be a *reimbursement* for the loss. It would pay
you out of the rest of your mortgage and leave you a little bit left
over for appreciation.

Since the condo association didn't have insurance to cover the
replacement cost of the building, you can't rebuild. You won't be able
to cover the cost of rebuilding the structure. So in that respect,
you're SOL (that's an old military acronym that means *shit outta
luck*).

In short, without insurance, they can't rebuild. A special assessment is
unreasonable to cover the construction of an entire new building. They
would be left with razing the rubble, selling the land, and hopefully
having enough from the sale of the land (and in operating reserves) to
cover what's left of the mortgage.

So what to do? Go buy another condo in a building whose HOA is
responsible enough to hold appropriate facility insurance. Let your
insurance company handle whether or not they will sue the HOA for not
carrying the appropriate insurance, which may be mandated by state law.
The HOA will probably also have to declare bankruptcy to cover the loss
of the building, which they certainly still owned and had a mortgage on.
If they owned the building outright, they may not have to declare
bankruptcy --- they may just dissolve and sell the land.

Original question:

If you own a condo and the condo building is destroyed by a natural
disaster not covered by the master policy purchased by the HOA, what
happens to you as a unit owner?
