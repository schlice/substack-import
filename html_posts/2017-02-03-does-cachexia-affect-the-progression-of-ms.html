Actually, it's the other way around. In more severe cases of progressive
MS, cachexia could be a symptom. It likely has no impact on the
progression of the disease, it is likely just a side effect of the end
stages of progressive MS.

Cachexia, or "wasting disease," is not fully understood. Inflammatory
cytokines could be a factor, but in MS, inflammation is only an
underlying issue in relapsing forms of the disease. Progressive forms of
the disease are characterized not by inflammation, but neural
degeneration. Inflammatory cytokine action is sometimes a result of that
degeneration. Therefore, it is most likely that cachexia is a result of
other disease activity; it likely is not a cause of any further disease
activity.

Cachexia is odd because it appears as muscle loss and appetite loss.
High-density nutrient intake can sometimes slow the progression of
cachexia, but does not stop the underlying muscle loss.
