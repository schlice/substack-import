**If a cop uses canine and the dog \'hits\' yet the officer finds
nothing after tearing my car apart, do I have any recourse for the
damage done to my car?**

Most departments have a method by which you can get reimbursement for
damage done during a lawful search.

You will have to pay for the damages yourself, and then seek
reimbursement from the department.
