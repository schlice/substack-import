Hello [[Karanbir
Singh](https://www.quora.com/profile/Karanbir-Singh-3)]{.qlink_container},
thanks for this question.

You're in college, so let's put this in terms you should be able to
understand.

You're a good student. You study hard. You turn in all your assignments
on time. And you have a 4.0 GPA to show for it.

Your roommate loves to party. You've never seen him open a textbook. You
often see him return to your room early in the morning, drunk, and pass
out on his bed. He's barely surviving with a 2.0 GPA.

Now it comes time for graduation. The college says that, to be fair to
everyone, they are going to "redistribute" your grade points. To that
end, they will take one grade point from you and give it to your
roommate. There. You both have a 3.0 GPA now. Isn't that better? Isn't
it more fair now that you both have the same GPA?

But you're thinking, how exactly is this fair? I worked my *tail* off to
get that 4.0 GPA. He did basically *nothing* and we both come out with
the same result! This is entirely *not* fair at all!

That's wealth redistribution in a nutshell.

Wealth is determined by individual effort. Wealth redistribution turns
*individual effort* into a *group outcome*. This nation was not founded
on equality of **outcome**. This nation was founded on equality of
**opportunity**. And if you have equality of **opportunity**, your
wealth is determined by your *individual effort.* The more individual
effort you put in, the more you get out. *Quid pro quo.* Taking from
someone who earned more and giving it to someone else who did not is
Robin Hood-style theft. It may be for a good cause, but the ends do not
justify the means.
