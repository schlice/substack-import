In terms of first aid, apply a pressure bandage. Hopefully you have some
form of clean trauma dressing available to you; if not, use whatever is
the cleanest and whitest dressing you have available. Sometimes, this
could be a piece of clothing. Back in the 80s, my dad (a retired New
York police officer) used his white undershirt as a trauma dressing and
saved a young man's life. Note that this is not recommended, but if
you're saving a life, you do what you have to do, and you use whatever
you have on hand.

If you still cannot control the bleeding with a pressure bandage, and it
is on an extremety, you may also want to apply a *restricting band* to
the area in the direction of the heart between the heart and the injury.
This will reduce (but not stop!) the blood flow to the affected area and
will aid you in controlling the bleeding.

Hopefully, help arrives before you have to make the fateful decision to
apply a tourniquet. If you apply a tourniquet, DO NOT REMOVE IT! Only
the doctor should remove a tourniquet. You should only apply a
tourniquet to save a life, if blood loss is so severe that not applying
a tourniquet would result in death. If you are interested in learning
how to apply a tourniquet, I will allow you to Google it yourself. There
are a number of details in applying a tourniquet, which is why I don't
want to do it the injustice of going over them here. If you're this
interested, you might think about taking a First Aid course from the Red
Cross.
