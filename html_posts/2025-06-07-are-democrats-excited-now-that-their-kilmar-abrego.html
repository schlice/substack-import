It's a Pyrrhic victory for the Democrats.

Democrats believe they've won some ground against the Trump
administration "unlawfully" deporting "illegal immigrants" without "due
process."

But the truth of the matter is much plainer.

- Congress decided that the courts would be waaaaaay too clogged up with
  immigration cases if we allowed them to go through the regular court
  system. So instead, Congress **gave** the power of enforcement of
  immigration law to **immigration judges** in federal immigration
  court.
- This, in fact, qualifies as "due process," since there is no
  Constitutional definition of it, and while we are required to give
  everyone due process, it does not have to look the same for citizens
  as it does for "illegal immigrants."
- So I presume that what's going to happen in this case is that as soon
  as Garcia lands in the US, he's going to be arrested and thrown in
  jail awaiting Federal charges for human trafficking. He's going to be
  tried and convicted, and since he's not a US citizen, he can be
  deported as part of his sentence. In fact, since there is no question
  that he's not a US citizen, he doesn't even need to see an immigration
  judge; he'd qualify for expedited deportation.

So the way this is going to go is that he's going to be tried and
convicted, and then he's going to go right back to that same El
Salvadorian prison we sprung him from.

(EDIT) SCOTUS approved third country deportations, so he's *not* going
to go back to El Salvador (we shouldn't have sent him back to El
Salvador anyway, that was an administrative error). He's going to go
somewhere else.

The Democrats get US citizen-style due process for an MS-13 gang member
(their *favorite people*, apparently), and after he's done wasting US
taxpayer money in the court system, we're just going to deport him right
back to the place we picked him up.

What a colossal waste of time and money so that the Democrats can try to
win points against Trump. Their TDS is clearly showing.
