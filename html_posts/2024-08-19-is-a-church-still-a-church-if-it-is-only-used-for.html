So I guess it comes down to me to answer the *real* question:

*What, exactly, is a church?*

A **church** is a group of people. It's not a place. It's not a
building.

But people commonly confuse the church building with the church. These
days, however, churches don't look like old traditional church buildings
did.

Why?

**Economics.**

If I build a church building like this:

:::: ui_qtext_image_outer
::: qtext_image_wrapper
![](images/qimg-62fe2ce18f407113a22bfc6b194ed284){.landscape
.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed
master_src="images/qimg-62fe2ce18f407113a22bfc6b194ed284" master_w="488"
master_h="306"}
:::
::::

There's pretty much only one thing I can use it for. If I sell this
building after the church closes (or, God-willing, relocates to a bigger
facility), I can't really re-use that building for much else. I have a
pretty limited pool of buyers for that building. Or it would take a lot
of money to modify that building to repurpose it, and my selling price
would be lower because of that.

But if I build a church building like *this*:

:::: ui_qtext_image_outer
::: qtext_image_wrapper
![](images/qimg-ad4e94f8ff2ad33b3140637702cfa723){.landscape
.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed
master_src="images/qimg-ad4e94f8ff2ad33b3140637702cfa723" master_w="516"
master_h="306"}
:::
::::

*(the entrance to my last church,* [[*The Grove Bible
Chapel*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=081670&url=https://thegrovebiblechapel.org/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="thegrovebiblechapel.org"}]{.qlink_container} *in Winter
Garden, FL)*

...and they wish to sell the building to relocate to a larger facility,
they are going to have a *much easier* time selling the building,
because it will require minimal remodeling in order to make it useful
for another purpose. The buyer pool will be *much larger* for The
Grove's building than it will for the generic church pictured above.

But it makes a valid point: the church building is just a building. The
owners can use it for whatever they want when services are not ongoing.
That said, casinos and brothels (in Nevada) must have special licensing,
and it's unlikely that the church would rent out the building for such
uses anyway, let alone that you likely cannot rent a building to host a
casino or a brothel. Zoning laws probably don't permit that.

\

To that point, sometimes a church has a need to reach a community before
that church has enough money raised to build their own building. So they
will often rent out other facilities so that they can have a place to
hold Sunday services.

And what government buildings are large enough to hold lots of people,
and are free on Sundays? That's right, *schools*.

Many churches rent out school buildings on the weekends to hold their
Sunday services. They use the classrooms for Sunday School or for
nursery, they use the library for meeting space, and they use the
auditorium for services. Churches operating like this will have all of
their church equipment in trailers, they will have volunteer setup crews
set up the church on Saturday afternoon/evening, hold services on
Sunday, and then break down Sunday afternoon/evening.

So in that instance, the services are held on Sunday, and the building
functions as a school Monday through Friday.
