In Relapsing-Remitting MS (RRMS), the most common form of MS, symptoms
get worse (a "relapse"), and then over time, gradually get better (a
"remission"). But just because the symptom improves doesn't mean the
disease has lessened. MS is still there, because the demyelination of
the nerve never goes away.

Over time, some people with RRMS may see their disease course change
into Secondary-Progressive MS (SPMS). SPMS is "secondary" because it
only occurs in people who have experienced Relapsing Remitting MS first.
In SPMS, symptoms will appear and will not go away; they will just
gradually worsen over time. SPMS can also be described as **active**
(with relapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity during a specified
period of time) or **not active**, as well as **with progression**
(evidence of more disability over time, with or without relapses or new
MRI activity) or **without progression**.
