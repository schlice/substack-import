HOAs are 501(c)(4) non-profit corporations. As such, their Directors are
unpaid volunteers.

No, HOA Board members get nothing (but ridicule) for doing the work they
do.

Board members can deduct any personal expenses they incur from their
taxes, but most HOA bylaws stipulate that Directors can receive no
compensation for their work. They wouldn't want to be compensated,
because drawing a salary would make a Director ineligible for the D&O
(Director and Officer) insurance carried by most Boards, meaning that
they'd be personally liable in a lawsuit against them related to their
Board duties.
