**Content:** [Your rights if you are hit by an emergency vehicle are the
same as if you were hit by any other vehicle. Its emergency designation
allows it to violate ***certain*** traffic laws. It does not provide
indemnification against damage which it causes to other vehicles.\
\
Your recourse would be to file suit against the ambulance company to be
reimbursed for the damage to the vehicle. Hopefully you filed a police
report; if you did not, your options will definitely be limited. With
the police report, you can prove that the accident happened at the
location you say it did. You can then correlate that to the information
you get during your pretrial discovery, as you will request the
ambulance company give you the listing of all of the calls that were
responded to that day, and you can then find the ambulance and the
driver.\
\
Once you know which ambulance hit you, you can look at the maintenance
records of that ambulance to find whether or not they repaired the
damage to the unit itself.\
\
You could also then requisition the training records of the ambulance
driver. You can determine whether or not the driver received the proper
emergency driving training, as required by California law. The driver
will not likely be individually liable, but the training will weigh
heavily on the court\'s decision.\
\
If you can find the ambulance, find the driver, and find the damage, you
can make a claim.\
\
If you did not file a police report, you are probably out of luck. You
can try to sue the ambulance company, but there really wouldn\'t be much
for you to prove that the ambulance hit you when you say it did. And if
they repaired the damage, there wouldn\'t be any physical evidence
besides some circumstantial evidence that the ambulance was repaired
subsequent to the time you state you had an accident. Probably won\'t be
enough to prove that the ambulance caused the damage to the car.\
\
Emergency organizations carry auto insurance which would cover them in
the event they cause damage during the course of the response to an
emergency. The driver could be reprimanded and could be made to attend
remedial driving training, but your repair bill would be paid by their
insurance.\
\
I do not have specific knowledge of California law in this case. Someone
with specific knowledge of California law when it relates to emergency
vehicles may be able to add more information for you.]{.rendered_qtext}
