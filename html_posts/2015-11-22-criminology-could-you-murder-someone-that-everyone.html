**Content:** [I think what you\'re talking about is the concept of
**double jeopardy.**\
\
Double jeopardy says that you cannot be tried twice for the same crime.
This was actually the subject of a movie, coincidentally called *Double
Jeopardy*.\
\
So to illustrate the concept, I\'ll give you the plot from the movie.
The wife (played by Ashley Judd) was falsely accused in the death of her
husband, who faked his death. She was tried and convicted for the
murder, even though no body was ever found. There was enough evidence to
send her to jail for the crime. While in prison, she learns the location
of her husband, who has taken up with a new family. Following her
release from prison, after serving her full sentence, she finds him and
murders him in the middle of a crowded street. She is arrested, but
cannot be tried for his murder since she was already tried, convicted,
and sentenced for the same murder.\
\
However, double jeopardy only attaches if it\'s the same person. If
*someone else* were to murder the husband, that person would then be
tried and convicted for the murder, even though the wife was already
tried and convicted for the murder. The new murder stands on its own
merit, despite a conviction for the same murder.]{.rendered_qtext}
