**Is a penitent bound by the seal of confession?**

Not according to the canon of the Catholic Church. But it wouldn't make
sense that the penitent would have to be bound by a confessional seal;
it's most likely that he doesn't want that kind of stuff getting out,
anyway. The point of the seal of confession is that when the penitent
confesses to the confessor (always a priest), that priest can never
reveal what he has heard.

The canon law of the Roman Catholic church states clearly, \"The
sacramental seal is inviolable; therefore it is absolutely forbidden for
a confessor to betray in any way a penitent in words or in any manner
and for any reason.\"

Additionally, anyone else who overhears the confession *is* also bound
by the confessional seal.

But if the penitent chooses to tell someone else his sins, there is no
such seal forbidding that. So a penitent can confess in the confessional
to committing a crime, and then can later confess to the police without
violating church law. For more serious offenses, a priest may even
advise a penitent to "turn himself in" and doing so would not violate
the seal of confession. The priest, however, can only advise the
penitent to do so; he may not divulge anything heard in confession to
anyone, including authorities.
