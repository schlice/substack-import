In an at-will employment scenario, you can be fired for any reason, or
no reason at all. So long as you are not fired for a *protected* reason
(i.e. your age, your sex, your skin color, your religion, or your
country of origin), you can be fired for any reason.

So can you be fired if you get the vaccine but still get COVID? Sure.
It's a stupid reason to fire an employee (for something that is out of
his control), but yes, you can be fired for this.

Some states may have implemented worker protections to protect employees
for getting fired due to COVID; check with your state labor board to see
if your state has such protections. But there is a fair chance that your
employer already knows the labor laws where you work.
