Um, go to the store?

The morning after pill (or Plan-B) prevents the fertilized egg from
implanting in the womb, so an abortion technically never happens.

Our grocery store sells them. You can pick them up right at the Customer
Service counter, and this is in Florida, where abortion is illegal after
15 weeks.

Even in states which have completely banned all abortions, you should
still be able to buy Plan-B pills, because it's technically not an
abortion.
