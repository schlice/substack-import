**If US justice dept policy is not to indite a sitting president, then
what happens if the statute of limitations runs out while that president
is in office? Is this a bad policy?**

In law, if a charge *cannot* be brought because of some external reason
(such as the defendant being ineligible to be indicted), the statute can
be
[[*tolled*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6f84f0&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolling_(law)){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} until that person becomes
eligible for indictment. In this case, the statute of limitations would
be tolled until the President is no longer the active president.

Once the President leaves office, either through impeachment or through
the natural expiration of his term, the clock once again starts.
