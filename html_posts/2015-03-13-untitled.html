<h2>Answer Comment</h2>
<div>

**Content:** [Forgive me please, it\'s been a long day and while I can
multitask (post on Quora and do my job), sometimes the stress of work
tends to bleed over to Quora and I get\...snippy. I\'m sorry if I did
that.\
\
This is a topic that I\'m very passionate about. While I think the
Ferguson PD is in serious trouble, most departments would be using this
scenario as a training exercise. They would be examining, re-examining,
and re-evaluating all of their training and best practices, and I know
that plenty of departments spent quite a few in-service training
sessions reviewing this scenario, what happened, where Wilson failed,
and how he could have improved.\
\
People need to take the time to objectively review what happened, and
that\'s really really hard to do when emotions get in the way. Yes,
we\'re sad for Michael Brown and the entire situation, but if we\'re
going to learn anything from it, we have to step back and apply that
objectivity. Thanks for doing that.]{.rendered_qtext}
