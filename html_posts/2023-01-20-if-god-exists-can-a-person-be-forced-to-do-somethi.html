An excellent question! I wonder if there's any historical document which
records just such an event...

Oh wait...

Let us turn to the book of Jonah, please, Chapter 1, Verse 1. To try to
make this a little easier for the reader to follow along, I won't quote
from a Bible version full of thee's and thou's. Instead, I'll quote from
the New International Reader's Version.

This, by the way, is the entirety of Chapter 1.

> 1 A message from the Lord came to Jonah, the son of Amittai. The Lord
> said, 2 "Go to the great city of Nineveh. Preach against it. The sins
> of its people have come to my attention."
>
> 3 But Jonah ran away from the Lord. He headed for Tarshish. So he went
> down to the port of Joppa. There he found a ship that was going to
> Tarshish. He paid the fare and went on board. Then he sailed for
> Tarshish. He was running away from the Lord.
>
> 4 But the Lord sent a strong wind over the Mediterranean Sea. A wild
> storm came up. It was so wild that the ship was in danger of breaking
> apart. 5 All the sailors were afraid. Each one cried out to his own
> god for help. They threw the ship's contents into the sea. They were
> trying to make the ship lighter.
>
> But Jonah had gone below deck. There he lay down and fell into a deep
> sleep. 6 The captain went down to him and said, "How can you sleep?
> Get up and call out to your god for help! Maybe he'll pay attention to
> what's happening to us. Then we won't die."
>
> 7 Here is what the sailors said to one another. "Someone is to blame
> for getting us into all this trouble. Come. Let's cast lots to find
> out who it is." So they did. And Jonah was picked. 8 They asked him,
> "What terrible thing have you done to bring all this trouble on us?
> Tell us. What do you do for a living? Where do you come from? What is
> your country? What people do you belong to?"
>
> 9 He answered, "I'm a Hebrew. I worship the Lord. He is the God of
> heaven. He made the sea and the dry land."
>
> 10 They found out he was running away from the Lord. That's because he
> had told them. Then they became terrified. So they asked him, "How
> could you do a thing like that?"
>
> 11 The sea was getting rougher and rougher. So they asked him, "What
> should we do to you to make the sea calm down?"
>
> 12 "Pick me up and throw me into the sea," he replied. "Then it will
> become calm. I know it's my fault that this terrible storm has come on
> you."
>
> 13 But the men didn't do what he said. Instead, they did their best to
> row back to land. But they couldn't. The sea got even rougher than

> Lord, don't let us die for taking this man's life. After all, he might

> took Jonah and threw him overboard. And the stormy sea became calm. 16
> The men saw what had happened. Then they began to have great respect

> to him.
>
> 17 Now the Lord sent a huge fish to swallow Jonah. And Jonah was in
> the belly of the fish for three days and three nights. --- Jonah
> 1:1--17 NIRV

So yes, if you take the Bible at face-value, sometimes God calls you to
do things you don't want to do. In Jonah's case, it was to go to the
city of Nineveh and preach against their wickedness.

Think about that. It's like today, God told you to go to Vegas and
preach against their sin and vice. Would you want to do that? Yeah, me
neither. But God told Jonah to go to Nineveh and do just that.

And Jonah said, "Yeah, thanks but no thanks." And so he ran down to the
wharf at the Port of Joppa and boarded a ship bound for Tarshish (clear
on the other side of the Mediterranean). In other words (and as
illuminated by the text), Jonah was trying to run away from God.

Except for the pesky fact that *you can't run away from God.* There's
nowhere that you can go that is "away" from God.

While God may not be causing giant fish to swallow us up for three days
or storms to suddenly pick up and then subside just as suddenly in the
middle of the Mediterranean, He still is displeased when we do not
follow Him. But He doesn't routinely punish us that way any longer, as
we are all saved by the blood of Christ. Our sins already have their
forgiveness through Christ. He does punish us (what good father doesn't
discipline their child?), just not in the same way as He used to, before
Christ came.

The Bible says this about our current discipline:

> As you endure this divine discipline, remember that God is treating
> you as his own children. Whoever heard of a child who was never
> disciplined? If God doesn't discipline you as He does all of His
> children, it means that you are illegitimate and are not really His
> child after all. Since we respect our earthly fathers who disciplined
> us, should we not all the more cheerfully submit to the discipline of
> our heavenly Father and live forever? For our earthly fathers
> disciplined us for a few years, doing the best they knew how. But
> God's discipline is always right and good for us because it means we
> will share in his holiness. No discipline is enjoyable while it is
> happening---it is painful! But afterward there will be a quiet harvest
> of right living for those who are trained in this way. --- Hebrews
> 12:7--11 ESV

Note that God does not discipline *everyone*, but He disciplines *His
children*. Notice what the passage says: "If God doesn't discipline you
as He does all of His children, it means that you are illegitimate and
are not really His child after all." In other words, if you are not
being disciplined by God, you may not be one of His children. It says
that He disciplines all of His children, and some are not His children.

It also says that God's discipline is not eternal. There is a period of
not-enjoyable discipline, but then there is "a quiet harvest of right
living" for believers. This passage thus tells us that hope abounds,
even through suffering.

If I could sum it up, I'd use the lyrics of the song *Sunday's On The
Way* by Take 6:

> *So when problems try to bury you (six feet deep),\
> And make it hard for you to pray,\
> It may seem like that Friday night,\
> But Sunday's on the way.*

It may be tough while you're going through it, but believers have the
hope that our redemption is not far off. God is near to those who love
Him.
