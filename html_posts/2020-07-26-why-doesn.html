**Why doesn\'t Amazon\'s Alexa services have a text interface? For
people with a speech impediment, this is a barrier to service. Does that
violate the ADA?**

Amazon is required to include **reasonable** accommodations; they are
not required to include **every** accommodation.

The Alexa app and Alexa-enabled products provide plenty of features for
customers with disabilities. This does not violate ADA, because Amazon
provides **reasonable** accommodations for people with disabilities, to
the extent that their devices are capable of doing so. For those with
speech impediments, you can buy an Alexa-enabled device which has a
screen to interact with the service, and Amazon has plenty of features
built in to assist those with speech issues. Perhaps they are working on
a text interface to Alexa. Perhaps that would be too big of an
engineering challenge and would require a complete re-tool of their
business, which they are not required to do under ADA. We don't know.
What we do know is that Amazon does have reasonable accommodations for
those with disabilities.

The full current list of accessibility features is listed here, but they
are adding new ones every day.
