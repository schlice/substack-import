**Why do military members constantly disrespect members of other
branches?**

Let's talk about *respect.*

Respect is **earned**. Respect is not **deserved**. I may respect you
because of your position (i.e. I respect a superior officer because he
or she is a superior officer), but I may not respect you as a person
(i.e. I may not want to go have a beer with you). You are not
automatically deserving of respect because of who you are or where you
work. You become worthy of respect when you do things which are worthy
of respect, and comport yourself in a manner worthy of respect.

Phew.

As far as the relationship between the branches, we have good-natured
*inter-service rivalry*. We do not *disrespect* each other, whatever
that means. At the end of the day, we all have the same job: support and
defend the Constitution. That's why we love our inter-service football
games. The Army-Navy game has been a tradition for over 100 years (the
first game was in 1890). I *love* to see that Army has a great team this
season. I love that they kept the Commander-in-Chief's trophy. I'd be
lying if I said I wasn't sad that Air Force didn't bring it home this
year. But Army deserves some wins, and the way they've been playing is
just awesome to watch.

General Douglas S. MacArthur said it best:

> *On the fields of friendly strife are sown the seeds that on other
> days and other fields will bear the fruits of victory.*
