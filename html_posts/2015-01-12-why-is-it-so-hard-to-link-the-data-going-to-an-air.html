**Content:** [Hard? It\'s not hard at all. Technically, it\'s very
simple to accomplish.\
\
So why isn\'t it being done?\
\
COST.\
\
It\'s way too expensive to continuously stream data from the aircraft.
The information has to travel over satellite because there aren\'t
reliable, full-time air-to-ground data links that can be used, and
satellite internet time isn\'t cheap.\
\
Until the airlines can do it for lower cost, it won\'t be
done.]{.rendered_qtext}
