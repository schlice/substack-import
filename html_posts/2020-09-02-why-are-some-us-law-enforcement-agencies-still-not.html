**Why are some U.S. law enforcement agencies still not required to wear
body cameras?**

Cameras are cheap, and there are even Federal grant programs to buy
cameras.

But video storage is expensive. Video storage administrators to manage
all of the video and all of the storage systems to house all the video
are expensive.

Amid calls to "defund the police," which we are told really means
*severely cut their funding*, many departments simply don't have the
money to buy storage systems and hire new video storage administrators.

You can't just dump a requirement on the police because you want to. You
have to consider how much it will cost the department to implement your
requirement. This happened to the military all the time; we call it an
"unfunded mandate." It is very difficult for any non-profit government
agency to deal with unfunded mandates.
