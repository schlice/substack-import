It's easy to "blame Biden" as he's the guy who sits at the desk which
used to have the placard on it that said, "The Buck Stops Here." Even
though the placard is no longer there, the sentiment remains. People
associate the president with the current economy.

But Biden didn't get us into this mess. Granted, he is not really doing
anything which will help get us out (and in many ways, he directly did
things which have made it worse), but if you're asking specifically
about the supply-chain issues which are driving up the cost of beef,
Biden didn't do that himself.

The COVID economic crisis and subsequent supply issues really explains
exactly what is happening right now:

- COVID closed a number of meatpacking plants, and when they re-opened,
  social distancing requirements made them work less efficiently,
  reducing their output.
- Drought has ravaged the grazing land for cows. The droughts across the
  west in both 2020 and 2021 have been tough for ranchers, reducing the
  number of heads of cattle, and reducing the size per cow by an average
  of 15 pounds. Nearly 1/3 of US head of cattle have been grazing in
  drought conditions over the past two years.
- That same drought, and the supply chain issues, have caused feed grain
  prices to skyrocket. While cows spend their early days grazing, they
  are eventually sent to a feed lot where they graze on corn and other
  grains. If the price of the grain goes up, the rancher makes less per
  head.

All of this means that ranchers earn less, which ultimately means that
beef costs more.

If supply-side economics works, then the right approach is to do
nothing. Higher prices mean that ranchers will raise more cattle,
meatpackers will expand operations, and consumers will buy more pork and
chicken to make up for the increases in beef prices. Eventually, the
market will equalize, and beef prices will come back down.

But the Biden administration has as its goal improving the resiliency of
the beef marketplace, noting that only four major meatpackers dominate
the meatpacking portion of the domestic beef operation. He wants to
encourage small packers to go up against the Big Four, as they are
known, and he wants to contribute about \$500 million in loans to do it.

Except that's not going to help us out in the near term. It takes years
to get a meatpacking operation built out and approved to start
processing beef. One of these large sized plants, all in, from concept
to full operations, can take well over a year and \$200 million to
start, so \$500 million isn't going to buy a lot of resiliency.

Original question:

The price of beef is skyrocketing and soon to be an expensive luxury
that few can afford. Do Republicans blame Biden for this?
