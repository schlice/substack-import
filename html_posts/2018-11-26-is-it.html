**Is it "unconstitutional" for an HOA to place limits on residents'
Christmas displays?**

(US answer)

The answer, as with all legal questions, is "it depends."

In general, HOAs have broad authority to regulate all activities within
their areas of control.

To see if we can understand the HOA's motivation in this case, let's
change the example a little bit and see if it still holds. In my HOA, we
limit the amount of flags you can display on a house to two. But what if
someone has three flags, and they're all religious in nature? Could the
homeowner claim a 1st Amendment exception, claiming that displaying the
flags is an exercise of religion? Or perhaps that the flags are a 1st
Amendment protected form of speech?

While the Constitution prohibits the government from restricting speech,
it is commonly accepted that the government *can* limit the **time,
place,** and **manner** of speech. They can establish reasonable times
that speech may take place (thus noise ordinances may be enforced
against free speech), they can tell you that you are not free to "speak"
in the middle of an active roadway, or they can move you to a more
suitable location for your speech.

However, an HOA is not the government. It is a corporation (generally a
501(c)4 non-profit) and so is not bound by the same Constitutional
restrictions as the government is. When you buy your house, you
essentially sign a "contract" with the HOA, saying you'll abide by their
rules or they can enforce a monetary penalty against you. They also have
an *ownership interest* over your property, because it resides within
their area of influence. This means that the HOA can enforce penalties
such as placing a lien on your house and then foreclosing on that lien
should you fail to pay it. In other words, they can legally take your
house from you if you fail to pay. You agree to this when you buy your
house. You are free to not buy that particular house in that area if you
wish, but you agreed to follow those rules when you bought your house.

And an HOA can enforce other necessary restrictions, such as the amount
of traffic you generate into the community, which places a burden on the
infrastructure and the neighbors. The HOA may limit your home-based
business, for example, depending on how much traffic it generates. If
there is not enough available parking for homeowners and guests, the HOA
may step in.

Remember also the purpose of the HOA is to maintain the neighborhood in
a state which maximizes neighbor's home values. They don't care what you
do to your own home value; they are only concerned about what *you* do
to your *neighbor's* home values. It is entirely conceivable that an
annual light display of this magnitude would negatively impact
surrounding home values, as buyers are known for eschewing NIMBY (Not In
My Back Yard) situations. In other words, buyers support the light
display, but they don't want to live next door to it every year.

In general, HOA rules have sections about holiday light displays,
usually stating that they must be taken down within a reasonable amount
of time following the holiday in question, weather-permitting. Leaving
Christmas decorations up until July will probably raise a few eyebrows.

In this case, were I on this particular HOA, I would see that the
homeowner took reasonable steps to limit vehicle traffic, this was a
limited time event, and it was also privately insured. It was approved
by the local city government, and if it was done correctly, it would
bring positive views to the neighborhood. I would take a poll of the
surrounding neighbors and see what they thought about the display, and
if they approved, I would allow it. I would ensure that they took down
the display promptly and that it did not unduly burden the neighbors.
Basically, I would make sure that the HOA fulfilled its role: making
sure that the homeowner's actions didn't negatively impact home values,
and as long as it did not, I would have to allow it. But working with
all the parties involved is key; many HOAs fail to do this.

**TL;DR: In general, it is not a Constitutional violation for an HOA to
place reasonable restrictions on holiday light displays.**
