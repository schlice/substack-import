**Can you be prosecuted for perjury after replying "NO" to an officer
inquiring as to whether you committed a crime?**

If the "officer" is a lawyer and you are in a court and you have sworn
to tell the truth, then you can be charged with perjury.

But in the United States, and you have not been sworn in on the witness
stand, you are under no legal obligation to tell the police the truth
about anything other than your name.

Especially in the scenario I have given, the 5th Amendment to the
Constitution specifically says that you cannot be "a witness against
yourself." This means that you cannot be forced to say things which
might incriminate you, *even if you are sworn to tell the truth, as in a
court of law.*

So in such a situation as I originally described, and you were providing
sworn testimony, and you were asked if you committed a crime, you would
decline to answer under the 5th Amendment to the Constitution, as such
an answer might incriminate you. This is also called "pleading the 5th,"
if you've ever heard that phrase.
