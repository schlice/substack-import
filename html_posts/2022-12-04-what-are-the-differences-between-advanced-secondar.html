The difference is in the name, not the symptoms.

Primary Progressive MS (PPMS) is MS that begins its journey with
worsening symptoms with no signs of remission.

Secondary Progressive MS (SPMS) usually begins as Relapsing-Remitting MS
(RRMS), but then eventually a relapse will occur and never remit, thus
signaling the transition to *secondary* progressive MS.

Without treatment, RRMS will transition to SPMS within about 10 years.
With treatment, that transition can be extended for quite some time.
