**Content:** [There is much scientific information to show that rational
thought centers in the brain do not fully develop until age 25. So the
science shows that the age of consent should actually be higher.\
\
However, tradition and logic allow that there are variables in the aging
process, and everyone is different. The government has set 18 as the age
of consent, and it is a standard here. Most states follow that standard,
some do not.]{.rendered_qtext}
