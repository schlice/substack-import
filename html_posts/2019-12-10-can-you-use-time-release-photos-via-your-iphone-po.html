**Can you use time release photos via your iPhone pointed outside your
house in place of a security camera like Ring or Vivint?**

Yes you can! Better than that, you can use your old phone virtually
exactly like a Ring or Vivint camera!

Clearly, you'll want to do this with an old, unused iPhone, since it
wouldn't make sense to do this with a phone with a current data plan.
But you absolutely can do this. In fact, there are a lot of great uses
for old mobile phones; baby monitors and a Google Home speaker are some
of the things that come to mind. But in this case, we're creating a
security camera.

1.  Download a piece of software called
    [[Alfred](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1e9843&url=https://alfred.camera/){.external_link
    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
    qt-tooltip="alfred.camera"}]{.qlink_container}. It's one of the best
    cross-platform mobile phone security camera softwares available.
    Alfred is free to use and gives you a remote view of your live feed,
    motion detection with alerts, free cloud storage, a two-way audio
    feed and use of both the front and rear cameras. Incidentally, this
    is all you can do with an iPhone. If you use Android, you can also
    set things like automatic restart of Alfred if the phone reboots,
    continuous focus, and setting of the resolution. Alfred also offers
    a Premium paid option which gives you features like
    higher-resolution viewing and recording, zoom capabilities, ad
    removal and 30-days of cloud storage. But try out the free version
    for a while, and if it meets your needs, don't buy the upgrade. If
    you want the additional features, you can upgrade if you choose, but
    it's not necessary to get the basic functionality.
2.  Plug in your phone (purchasing a long charging cable is a great idea
    here), connect it to the wireless network, and mount it where you
    want. You can use a simple tripod mount, or those car suction cup
    mounts work great to put your phone up against the window to look
    outside.
3.  Log in to Alfred on the security camera (we'll call it the "old
    phone"). Log in to your Google account and select "Camera." That's
    pretty much it.
4.  On your active phone (we'll call it the "new phone"), you should
    also download the Alfred app, log in with the same Google account,
    and select "Viewer."

That's about it. Alfred isn't the only solution out there, there are a
few others. I've used **Manything** in the past and it's also very good,
with a good basic free offering, and paid upgrades if you want more
options.
