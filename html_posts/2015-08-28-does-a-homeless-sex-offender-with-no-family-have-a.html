**Content:** [So what you\'re really asking is, \"Has the sex offender
registry actually done any good?\"\
\
I mean, we don\'t have the \"Convicted murderer registry,\" do we? We
don\'t have the \"Convicted Armed Robbery Registry,\" do we? And who
knows? We might need those, right? I mean, I think I\'d want to know if
my neighbor is a convicted murderer or armed robber.\
\
First of all, the fact that someone has to register means that there is
no possibility for reform, and that is simply not true. Sometimes,
people will be added to the registry because they did something stupid.
I know of at least one person who was required to register as a sex
offender because he was drunk and while stumbling home he decided to
relieve himself against a building. A family with small children saw
him, and called the police. The public urination charge wasn\'t
humiliating enough. The fact that he exposed himself in public meant an
automatic requirement to get on the sex offender registry. Because he
got drunk and stupid, he\'s ruined for life.\
\
It\'s for this reason alone that we should get rid of the registry. It
is ruining lives.\
\
But if we\'re not going to get rid of the registry, we need to be
reforming who gets put on it. Mandatory registration should only be
required of the worst offenders, violent offenders and those who have
violated against children (and this doesn\'t include the 18 year old who
has consentual sex with a 16 year old after she lied to him about her
age. It does mean the over 20-something who has non-consentual sex with
a minor).\
\
Judges need to have flexibility on who gets added to the registry, and
understanding the ramifications of adding someone to the registry, they
must do so with prudence. And there should be a civilian oversight
committee that reviews people added to the registry.\
\
\<stepping off of soapbox\>\
\
Now, back to you and your question. What do you tell someone who is on
the registry? You\'re right, it is very hard, because once you\'re on
the registry, you never get off.\
\
But who will hire a sex offender? Why not use the registry to your
advantage? The registry also shows where sex offenders work; ergo, the
registry can show you workplaces that will hire sex offenders. Advise
the homeless person to go to the registry and look at the registered
offenders in their area and where they work, and then seek out
employment from those companies.\
\
Who else will hire a sex offender? As reported by
[[sexoffenderjobs.com](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b06263&url=http://www.sexoffenderjobs.com){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="sexoffenderjobs.com"}]{.qlink_container}, most companies
will not hire sex offenders for minimum wage jobs because there is
usually too much customer interaction and they simply can\'t afford the
risk. However, all is not lost. Jobs that make from \$10-\$30/hour are
generally jobs that require doing some sort of manual labor (if you
don\'t have a degree). Reportedly, they will hire \"anyone\" and don\'t
really care much about your past. And most of the time, these jobs are
simple to get, they just take persistence. So while nearly all minimum
wage jobs are out, there are definitely other opportunities. Check the
website, they have a pretty comprehensive list of companies that have
hired sex offenders in the past.\
\
How about this one: if a company won\'t hire you, make your own! If
you\'re passionate about something, turn that passion into a business!
Entrepreneurship is a great way to be your own boss. The sexoffenderjobs
website talks about a barber who primarily services Black clients and
cuts amazing and beautiful pieces of art into their hair. He charges
between \$30 and \$60 per client (which people will gladly pay), and
everyone knows he is a convicted sex offender who molested children, but
no one cares because his haircuts are just too good to pass up.\
\
Remember this: If you have a pulse, you have a purpose. You may not know
what it is, but you have one. Your job is to find it.]{.rendered_qtext}
