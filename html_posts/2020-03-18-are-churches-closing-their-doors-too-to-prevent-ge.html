**Are churches closing their doors too to prevent germs from spreading,
or can they choose to remain open for their flock?**

Televised church services have been taking place for decades in the
United States. At least one church in most towns has had their Sunday
services televised for quite a long time.

These days, most churches already offer online recordings of their
services, and have been doing so for some time now. Some even live
stream their entire service. Therefore, in most cases, it was quite a
simple thing to just hold Sunday services virtually instead of
physically.

This past Sunday, we attended services online. No one was in the worship
center except the worship team themselves.
