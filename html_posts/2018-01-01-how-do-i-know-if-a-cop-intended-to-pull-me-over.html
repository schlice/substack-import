(US Answer)

You're driving along in your car. You look in your rear-view mirror, and
you see a police car with its lights on.

**How do I know if this cop intends to pull me over?**

You apply your right turn signal and move one lane right.

One of two things happens.

1.  The officer speeds by you. From this, you can conclude that **the
    officer did not intend to pull you over.**
2.  The officer follows your lane change right behind you. So you do
    another one. He follows again. Finally, you pull your car to the
    side of the road and stop, and the officer pulls behind you. From
    this, you can conclude that **the officer intended to pull you
    over.**

It's actually quite simple.
