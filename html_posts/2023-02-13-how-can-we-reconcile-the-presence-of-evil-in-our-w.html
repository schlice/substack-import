So if you're trying to "reconcile" the two, then there must be some
belief that they are *opposites.* In other words, you must believe that
"an all-powerful and benevolent God" cannot exist in the same universe
as "evil existing." Therefore, either an all-powerful benevolent God
exists and he *allows* evil, or such a God does not exist.

The first thing we need to do in order to answer this question is to
determine the definition of *evil* with respect to God. With God in
mind, therefore, evil is "anything that opposes the will of God."

God didn't create evil, because evil is not a thing that can be created,
like a tree or a bird. You can't have a cup of evil, or a box of evil.
Evil is not a thing. It is a state of being in contravention with the
will of God. For example, we all know that holes exist. But how do you
*create* a hole? You have to remove some other material. So a hole isn't
a thing so much as a *lack of a thing*. You can think of evil in the
same way.

So how can we reconcile that God, being all-powerful and benevolent,
hasn't simply eliminated evil?

The short answer is **He will, but not yet.** The Bible details His
plans for eliminating all evil and casting Satan and his minions into
hell. In other words, He is going to eliminate evil, but in His time.

It's really hard to comprehend that everything that happens is all part
of His good plan for us. It's hard to comprehend how an infant dying
from SIDS is all part of His plan. Or how a person who was going to be a
doctor for Doctors Without Borders and save hundreds, if not thousands
of lives, who was killed by a stray bullet in a gang war is part of His
plan. ยน

But His ways are *so much higher* than our ways, and His thoughts are
*so much higher* than our thoughts. We could never hope to comprehend
His mind. We're not commanded to not think about it, but we are
commanded to not "lean on" our own understanding.

> Trust in the Lord with all your heart\
> and lean not on your own understanding;\
> in all your ways submit to him,\
> and he will make your paths straight. --- Proverbs 3:5--6 NIV

\

The bottom line is that everything that has happened, including the
introduction of the first sin into the world, was all a part of God's
good plan.

You can see the outline of God's plan throughout the Bible. Theologians
generally chart out this overarching *meta-narrative* like this:

1.  Paradise (Genesis 1--2)
2.  Paradise lost (Genesis 3 - Revelation 20)
3.  Paradise regained (Revelation 21--22)

As you can see, there is a *great deal* of time spent between paradise
lost and paradise regained. Not surprisingly, the approximate midpoint
of that portion of the narrative is the cross, *which God also planned.*

Therefore, you must also understand the following:

- Man's sin was known by God before it happened.
- The sending of Jesus to die on the cross to atone for man's sin was
  pre-planned.
- All people will one day glorify God (Psalm 86:9), and God purposes "to
  bring unity to all things in heaven and on earth under Christ"
  (Ephesians 1:10).

Here's the pull quote: **we would never know grace if we had never
needed grace.** God created Adam and Eve knowing full well they would
sin and need grace. They were given free will, and were allowed to make
their own decisions. Despite their decision to disobey, it served as the
vehicle for God\'s ultimate plan and the manifestation of His
unadulterated splendor.

Original question:

How can we reconcile the concept of an all-powerful and benevolent God
with the existence of evil in the world?

ยน This leads in to another discussion about **why bad things happen to
good people**, which I have already answered: [[Bill Stein\'s answer to
