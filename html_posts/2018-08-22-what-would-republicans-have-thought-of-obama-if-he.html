**What would Republicans have thought of Obama if he had admitted to
paying porn stars hush money in the run up to his election? Would it
have been okay if it had been his own money?**

You're not asking the right question.

The right question would have been, "What would ***Democrats*** have
thought of Obama if he had admitted to paying porn stars hush money in
the run up to his election?"

If Democrats say that it was fine for Obama to have paid off women with
whom he had affairs, then it's equally fine that Trump did the same
thing.

But all must be equal: Obama needs to have been a rich businessman
well-known for having much-vaunted (by him) affairs with many women.

Then all things would be equal.

***Republicans*** wouldn't have though much better of Obama if that were
true. They already didn't like his big-government policies; this
wouldn't have changed their opinion of him, other than to add to their
dislike of him, on a personal level rather than political.

While I disagreed with Obama *politically*, I liked him *as a person*.
He appeared to be a decent family man, and I can respect that. I think I
would have enjoyed spending personal time with him. If he admitted
paying off porn stars to keep them quiet about his dalliances, it would
have changed my *personal* opinion of him.

Trump is the exact, polar opposite of Obama. I have less than zero
respect for Trump *as a person,* but I can respect him *politically.*
