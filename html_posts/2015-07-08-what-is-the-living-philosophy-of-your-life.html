about life \-- it goes on.\" \-- Robert Frost\

Life goes on. There will be ups and downs, good times and bad times. You
have to count on them all happening, because they will.\
\
But one thing is for certain through all of the ups and downs: life goes
on. So live your life. Don\'t dwell on the downs or the ups. Just
live.]{.rendered_qtext}
