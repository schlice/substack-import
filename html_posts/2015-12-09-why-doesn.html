A few other points that haven\'t been brought up yet:

**There are over 300 million guns in the United States.**

This means that there are roughly enough guns that every man, woman, and
child in the United States can all possess one. Or, even if we stopped
selling new guns in the United States today, there would be enough guns
available to continue to meet the needs of everyone who wanted one for
the next hundred years or so. Guns are durable, simple machines. They
last for a very long time when well-maintained. Replacement parts are
easily obtained and they are relatively easy to repair.

**It\'s distasteful to suddenly turn millions of Americans into
criminals overnight.**

Banning guns would turn millions of law-abiding gun owners into
criminals. What are they to do with all these guns? Should we implement
a buyback program? Will you buy these guns at fair market value? Who
will pay for that? Paying fair market value for guns would be an
*astronomically expensive* proposition, and we can\'t even agree how and
to what extend we should be paying for other people\'s healthcare; I\'m
not really into paying more taxes so the government can collect and
destroy guns. It just doesn\'t make fiscal sense.

**While media coverage may indicate otherwise, there isn\'t as much gun
violence as there may appear to be.**

It seems like every time you turn around, there\'s another news story of
some crazy person shooting up a building. Discounting the incidents of
terrorism (which needs to be handled differently), it still appears that
there is lots of violence out there, and it involves guns.

The prevailing thought seems to be that if you remove the guns, you
remove the violence.

*This simply is not true.*

People have shown that they have a great propensity for violence, and
the presence or absence of a gun does not change that. If someone wants
to kill, there are any number of ways he or she can accomplish that. A
gun simplifies the task, but it also limits the killer to killing
*individuals*, not true \"mass killings\" like we\'ve seen in other
countries. Australia has found that arson has become a popular tool for
killing many people on a large scale. So while they may have fewer
incidents, each one kills more per incident than our shootings in
America. And in comparison to the total population, their rate of
killings is on par with ours.

**Making guns** ***illegal*** **won\'t make guns** ***disappear.***

We\'ve tried that before. Remember what happened with Prohibition? We
made alcohol illegal. Did it go away? Hardly. It actually encouraged
criminal activity and spurred the creation and enhancement of the black
market. Has making drugs illegal been any more successful? We spend
*billions* on the War on Drugs, militarize our police forces, and
incarcerate more people in state and federal prisons on drug charges
than for any other crime.

**Ultimately, the gun is not the problem**

The gun is an easy target for ire. It is the only tool available that is
purpose-built to kill. By demonizing the gun, we symbolically say that
we, as a society, will not tolerate killing.

But is that the right thing to do?

Today, on this day, millions of law-abiding Americans have used hundreds
of millions of guns to do ***absolutely nothing***. They have not killed
anyone. They have not used their guns to inflict violence or terror on
anyone. The majority of those guns have sat idly in gun safes. Some of
those Americans even *carry* their guns in public, legally, and even
concealed, and you probably walked by one of them and didn\'t even know
it. Did it harm you? Not in the slightest. Again, you probably didn\'t
even know.

It goes contrary to the fundamentals of individual freedom on which this
country was founded to say that an activity that does not impact you in
the slightest should be penalized.

In fact, you may find yourself to be the beneficiary of their carry if
they use their weapon to stop a criminal, even if a shot is never fired.
This happens *every day* in the United States, but you\'ll never hear
about it on the evening news because it\'s not sensational enough to
sell airtime. Would you rather delegate the responsibility of your own
safety (which is your responsibility) to someone else? The police,
perhaps? Not I. When seconds count, the police are only minutes away.
They can\'t be responsible for my safety.

The gun is a tool. We should only outlaw a tool of killing when we can
say that there are no circumstances, ever, in which it is acceptable to
kill, or when I can safely and effectively defend myself from someone
with a gun, with another equally-effective tool, that will not kill.
Since we cannot say that, the gun is still a viable tool.

We need to focus more on the person who believes that it is acceptable
to use a gun in **offense**, rather than in **defense**. There are many
reasons why this happens. Mental illness has become a national epidemic,
and a mentally unstable individual with a gun can cause serious damage.
Radicalized religious zealots will take lives in the name of their
religion, and with this country\'s freedom of religion, we have very
little means to stop them. Until we can tackle these problems, the gun
is way down there on the list of priorities to address.

Especially when the right to own a gun is written into the Constitution.
