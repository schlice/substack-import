**A lab technician that my aunt knows told her that he had processed her
blood when she saw him out in public. Isn\'t that a HIPAA privacy
violation?**

That alone is probably not a HIPAA violation.

If he revealed the *results* of the lab test, that *might* be a HIPAA
violation.

If he revealed the results of the lab test ***to anyone else***, that
*definitely* would be a HIPAA violation.

But the simple fact that a lab tech processed a sample for someone he
knew (and subsequently told her that he did) is not a violation. He's
not necessarily required to maintain his privacy from her. He's required
to maintain his privacy from everyone else.
