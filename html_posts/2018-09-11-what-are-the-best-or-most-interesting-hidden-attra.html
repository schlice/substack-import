**What are the best or most interesting hidden attractions in or near
Colorado Springs?**

Hidden attractions? Heck, let's start with the visible attractions,
since those need some love, too.

For the best, most up-to-date listing of things to do in and around
Colorado Springs and the Pikes Peak Region, take a look at our great
[[Official Visitor Guide
Attractions](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b7a246&url=https://www.pikes-peak.com/attractions/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="pikes-peak.com"}]{.qlink_container} page. This is a really
well-done interactive site which shows you all of the great things to do
in and around the Pikes Peak region.

Highlighted on that site (or should be) are the #1 *natural* tourist
attraction in the region ([[Pikes
Peak](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0a4243&url=https://www.pikes-peak.com/attractions/pikes-peak-americas-mountain/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="pikes-peak.com"}]{.qlink_container}), and the #1 *man-made*
tourist attraction in the state ([[the Air Force Academy Cadet
Chapel](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b19ae5&url=https://www.usafa.edu/academics/facilities/cadet-chapel/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="usafa.edu"}]{.qlink_container}). Of note: if you come visit
the Chapel, you might see me! I'm a Docent at the Academy, so come by
the Visitor's Center and say hi. I'll give you a personal guided tour,
with insights that only a grad can give.

Some attractions which are less popular (or more hidden) but are really
cool: [[Old Colorado
City](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c96d93&url=https://www.pikes-peak.com/attractions/historic-old-colorado-city/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="pikes-peak.com"}]{.qlink_container}, [[Santa's
Workshop](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2f9663&url=https://www.pikes-peak.com/attractions/north-pole-santas-workshop/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="pikes-peak.com"}]{.qlink_container}, the [[Western Museum of
Mining and
Industry](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d19ffa&url=https://www.pikes-peak.com/attractions/western-museum-of-mining-and-industry/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="pikes-peak.com"}]{.qlink_container}, and the [[Space
Foundation Discovery
Center](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=22ba07&url=https://www.pikes-peak.com/attractions/space-foundation-discovery-center/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="pikes-peak.com"}]{.qlink_container}.
