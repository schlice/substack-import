Yes, and that was the whole purpose of the 14th Amendment.

The Reconstruction Amendments (13--15) were added to the Constitution
following the Civil War. In order for the southern states to be
re-admitted into the Union, they had to ratify these Amendments. The
14th Amendment says, in part, that everyone is treated equally under the
law:

> All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to
> the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the
> State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law
> which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the
> United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life,
> liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any
> person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.

There are three main parts to the Amendment:

- the Privileges and Immunities clause
- the Due Process clause, and
- the Equal Protection clause

The text of your question is answered by the Equal Protection clause:
"nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of
the laws." That means that this doesn't just apply to US citizens. Note
to whom it applies: **any person within \[the state's\] jurisdiction**.
It applies to all **persons**, not just all **citizens**.

Now, that doesn't mean this always happens, but it is what the
Constitution says.
