**Will the next American administration make a definitive law regarding
that a sitting President is not above the law and can be charged with a
crime while in office?**

No, because it doesn't make sense.

The reason it does not make sense is because the Constitution vests
**all** of the authority for prosecution in one person: the President of
the United States.

Article II Section 1: "The executive Power shall be vested in a
President of the United States of America."

Not the President and the Attorney General. Not the President and the
Director of the FBI. The President.

This was done intentionally as part of our system of *checks and
balances*.

The framers knew that Congress was going to be the most powerful branch
of the government. To check that power, they vested the power of law
enforcement in a unitary office (the President).

To that end, *all prosecutorial authority in the United States flows
from the authorization of the President*. When a prosecutor files a
charge on behalf of the Federal government, the authority to execute
that prosecution comes from the President. It makes no legal sense for a
Federal prosecutor to be able to prosecute the person who has provided
his authority to prosecute. In reality, anyone in that position would
simply disallow the prosecution, as he has the full authority to do so.
This effectively means that **while that person holds that office, he
cannot be prosecuted.**

This does not mean this person is above the law. If evidence exists (and
I mean real legal evidence, not the stuff Congress is blathering on
about) that the President has actually committed a crime, the
Constitution actually has a remedy for that situation: *impeachment*.
Once the person no longer holds the prosecution-immune office of the
President, he can be indicted and prosecuted. Remember, it's not that
the President can't be indicted, it's that the *current holder of the
office of the President* cannot be directly indicted.

If real, prosecutable evidence exists, you'll hear a US Attorney state
that they are ready to move forward with a case for indictment of the
President; all they are waiting for is for that person to become
eligible for indictment.

This has been researched by the White House Office of Legal Counsel
(OLC) on several occasions, and they have published [[several
papers](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f465ac&url=https://www.justice.gov/olc/opinion/sitting-president%25E2%2580%2599s-amenability-indictment-and-criminal-prosecution){.external_link

Constitutional reasons why you cannot indict a sitting President, which
I have summarized here for you.

People mistakenly believe that it is *only* the OLC's opinion that
prevents US Attorneys from filing indictments against the President, and
that Congress, by passing a simple law, could somehow make the President
eligible for indictment while in office. This is not the case.

This would require a Constitutional amendment to alter the structure of
the Constitution such that you weaken the office of the President by
removing the executive power from the President, or by making the
executive power no longer unitary (i.e. vested in more than one person).
But it cannot be done with a change in law; it must be done with a
change to the very structure of the Constitution.

**TL;DR: Since the President holds all of the executive authority and
thus all of the authority of prosecution, it makes no sense for a
President to be able to be indicted while in office. The Constitutional
remedy is to remove the President from that office, and the Constitution
already has that remedy available: impeachment.**
