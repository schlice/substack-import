**Isn\'t \"how are you doing today?\" an inappropriate question to ask
an emergency room patient? Shouldn't hospitals train staff NOT to do
this?**

I can't see how it is an inappropriate question at all.

Patient self-assessment is a vital component to understanding where
medical attention needs to be focused. All care starts and ends with the
needs of the patient.

Asking the patient how they are doing (or words to that effect) give the
patient the opportunity to verbalize what they are experiencing. Some
can do it better than others, but all who are conscious and can move can
at least point to the area where it hurts.

Perhaps if you can explain why you feel that asking someone how they are
doing is inappropriate and must be legislated out of existence, we can
better answer your question.
