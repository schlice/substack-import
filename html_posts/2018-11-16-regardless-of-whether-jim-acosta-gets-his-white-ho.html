**Regardless of whether Jim Acosta gets his White House pass back
permanently, can the White House simply never call on him again during a
press conference?**

I don't see why they must call on him. I'm not aware of a Constitutional
argument that says not only do you have a 1st Amendment right to be
present in the White House Briefing Room, but you have a right to be
heard. I've never heard a 1st Amendment argument say that you have a
right to be heard. Most classical 1st Amendment arguments state that you
have a right to speak, not a right to be heard.

Therefore, in theory at least, he can be present in the room and never
be called on to ask questions.
