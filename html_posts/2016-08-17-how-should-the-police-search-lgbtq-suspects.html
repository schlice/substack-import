Remember that all of this is absent exigent circumstances (i.e. an
appropriate-gender officer is not available or there is a time
criticality involved). Most departments these days will attempt to be
sensitive to the perceived gender of the suspect. If the suspect claims
to be LGBTQ, in general we will follow the perceived gender identity and
proceed accordingly. For example, if the suspect identifies as female,
we will attempt to have a female officer conduct the search.

Absent that, or when exigent circumstances are present, we will conduct
the search with whatever officer is available, and use the back of the
hand in the genitals and under and around breasts (it's difficult to
claim that the officer was "groping" you with the back of his hand, and
it's sensitive enough to feel a weapon stuffed into undergarments)
