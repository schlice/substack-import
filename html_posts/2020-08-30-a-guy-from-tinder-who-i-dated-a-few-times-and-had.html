Same rule for anyone at your door:

- Tell them to leave.
- If they do not leave, tell them to leave or you will call the police.
- If they do not leave, call the police and report a trespasser
  harassing you in your home. Make sure they know you are afraid he
  might hurt you (even if you aren\'t sure).

That goes for anyone at your door, regardless of whether it\'s a mean
neighbor, a vacuum salesman, or that regrettable Tinder hook-up.
