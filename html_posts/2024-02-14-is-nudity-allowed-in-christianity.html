After Adam and Eve sinned, their eyes were opened and they realized they
were naked, and they felt *shame* and *embarrassment* at their nudity.
In a sad attempt to cover their shame, they used fig leaves to attempt
to cover themselves. This shows us that our fallen nature as humans has
caused us to be instinctively aware that our nudity is something
*shameful*, something we should keep hidden or covered. This is also
highlighted by the fact that God created coverings of skin for the pair,
something a bit more substantial and permanent than those woven fig
leaves. God was demonstrating that, in a newly fallen world, clothing is
both appropriate and necessary.

We still live in a fallen world, surrounded by lust, immorality, and
perversion. The innocence of Eden is gone. We should be cautious about
nudity, and reserve it for our spouses only. This is the only place in
which nudity is permitted in Christianity: within the confines of
marriage.
