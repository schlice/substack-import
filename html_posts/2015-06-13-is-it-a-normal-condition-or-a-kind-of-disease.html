**Content:** [What you are describing is the beginnings of an eating
disorder. The feelings you describe are some of the feelings that people
with eating disorders commonly feel. I will avoid labeling this disorder
with a name; there are several eating disorders out there. I will let
the professionals handle that part.\

You need to seek mental health care. You need to do this soon (i.e. this
month). Please do not let this go. Talk to someone now before this gets
out of hand. Believe me, there are treatments available to help you. If
this gets worse, it can physically hurt you. The other respondents here
are correct, you can get seriously hurt if you allow this to continue.
Don\'t feel bad about going to seek help; none of us are perfect, we all
need help occasionally. Please talk to a mental health professional. If
you don\'t have one to talk to, talk to your doctor, or (worst case) go
to the ER.]{.rendered_qtext}
