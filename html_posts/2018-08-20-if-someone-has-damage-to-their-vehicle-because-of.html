**If someone has damage to their vehicle because of one of these MLK Day
dirt bike gangs, can the district police be sued for the damages? Police
were aware that the 50+ bikers have been causing chaos in the streets
every Sunday and have done nothing.**

The short answer is no. Police are no more responsible for preventing
damage to your car because of the actions of private individuals than
anyone else.

Police have a general responsibility to protect the public at large.
Police have no specific duty to protect any one individual (with some
narrow exceptions).
