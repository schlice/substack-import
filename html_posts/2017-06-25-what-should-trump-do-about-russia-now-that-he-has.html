Jeh Johnson, the former Secretary of Homeland Security, just finished
testifying in Congress. Congressman Mike Conaway from Texas questioned
him:

> CONAWAY: "One of our purposes this morning was to reassure the
> American public with \[regard\] to the 16 election and also secondly
> look at what we do in future elections going forward. You said in your
> opening statement, in your prepared remarks that to your knowledge
> there was no vote tallying changes, that no one's vote was voted one
> way and recorded some other way. Is that still your opinion with
> respect to the 16 election?"
>
> JOHNSON: Based on everything I know, that is correct. I know of no
> evidence that through cyber intrusions, votes were altered or
> suppressed in some way.

The Washington Post published a piece entitled, "[[Obama's secret
struggle to punish Russia for Putin's election
assault](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f36e1c&url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/world/national-security/obama-putin-election-hacking/?utm_term%3D.a127e01a734e){.external_link

qt-tooltip="washingtonpost.com"}]{.qlink_container}." Wow, sounds pretty
serious, doesn't it? Sounds like, first of all, Obama was dealing with
it before Trump was even President, or even a candidate, and secondly,
he did nothing about it. Nevertheless, in this "hard-hitting exposÃ©,"
the following quote is written:

> Despite the dire warnings, there were no meltdowns in the United
> States' voting infrastructure on Nov. 8, no evidence of
> hacking-related fraud, crashing of electronic ballots or manipulation
> of vote counts.

So from the testimony of various and sundry former officials, and from
the *totally unbiased* reporting at the ever-ethical New York Times,
**there was no election tampering.**

What exactly does "meddling" mean anyway? Does hacking DNC computers and
giving the results to WikiLeaks constitute "meddling?" If so, I'm *glad*
for that meddling, if you're *glad* that Edward Snowden can leak
classified documents that **get people killed** to WikiLeaks. What's
good for the geese...

Anyway, there's nothing to see here. This is literally the biggest piece
of fake news nonsense non-story that I can remember. There is literally
no election tampering. Everyone admitted it. There's nothing to see.

So why are we still talking about it?
