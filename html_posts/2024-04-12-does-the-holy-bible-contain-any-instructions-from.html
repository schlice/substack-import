Interesting question.

What is the source of this morality which would seek to claim that an
"instruction from God" is "immoral?" This source must be one that God is
subject to.

So: what is the source of morality which God did not create which God
must follow?

\

The answer, of course, is that there is none.

The questioner is substituting human ideas of morality for God's truth.
The questioner could only interpret "instructions from God" based on
man's interpretation of morality, and God is certainly not subject to
man's interpretation of morality.

God is the author of morality; therefore, God is not subject to that
morality in the same way that we, His creation, are.

Since God's very nature does not allow Him to violate His own being, He
can never be immoral, as He is the author of morality.

The only way you could "consider" something directed by God to be
immoral is if your interpretation of morality conflicts with God's given
morality.

So it is nothing more than a matter of interpretation. Man interprets
God's morality and finds it lacking, but there is no rational basis upon
which God would ever be subject to that version of morality.

No, it is impossible for God to act immorally, because if God does it,
it is *de facto* moral.
