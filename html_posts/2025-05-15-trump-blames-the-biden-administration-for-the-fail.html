Even if they were to start today to source a whole new ATC system for
the entire country, it would take the better part of a decade to get it
in. Spend a little time in government contracting, and you'll find that
critical government systems cannot be wholesale swapped out. No "rip and
replace" here. The new system must be scoped, contracts written,
contractors bid, a prime contractor selected, then the new system has to
be built (and by this point the system is already a few years behind the
times), then the system must be installed *beside* the old system with
the old system as primary and the new system as backup. Then, when the
program guidelines are met, a cutover is planned and the new system
becomes primary with the old system as backup. The systems will run like
this until all reliability and usability standards are met (another
6--12 months), at which point we can decommission the old system.

This is a process which takes anywhere from six to ten years to
accomplish. If you push really hard, perhaps you can force it through in
like five years, but no one in the government will ever "rip and
replace" a system.

So Trump isn't right for blaming Biden for not fixing it. No one will
fix this system in two years.
