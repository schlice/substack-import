You asked when a "selective enforcement violation" applies, as if
practicing selective enforcement is illegal.

Not only is selective enforcement (in this context, "prosecutorial
discretion") legal, but in some cases, it's advisable, or even
necessary. For example, what if *everyone* on the Interstate is
exceeding the speed limit? It simply isn't practical for one police
officer to stop *everyone* on the Interstate and give them speeding
tickets; usually they just stop the most egregious violators. And in
some cases, giving a teen a warning instead of arresting him for
whatever crime he had committed is enough to "scare him straight" and
get him back on the right path.

Sometimes, during a riot, it's simply not practical to charge everyone
who has any sort of violation, or we'd literally bog down the courts
with all the violations.

When does a selective enforcement of laws violation apply? Why would it
not apply to the lack of charges against one of Kyle Rittenhouses
assailants who had an illegally concealed firearm which he pointed at
Kyle (aggravated assault)?
