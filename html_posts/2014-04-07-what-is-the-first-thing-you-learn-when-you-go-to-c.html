**Content:** [The first thing I learned is that computers are dumb,
meaning they are utterly unintelligent. A computer is only as good as
its programming. Some computers may have exceptional hardware, but
hardware sits idle without running some kind of software, either the
firmware which makes the hardware work, or the software which makes the
computer perform some meaningful task. The computer itself is a brick.
It is the software that makes a computer shine.]{.rendered_qtext}
