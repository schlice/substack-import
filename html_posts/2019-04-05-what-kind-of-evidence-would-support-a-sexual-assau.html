**What kind of evidence would support a sexual assault case that will
prove it was not consensual?**

Any physical evidence or direct witness testimony that speaks to the
fact that the contact was unwanted.

These can include, but are not limited to:

- defensive injuries (scratches, bruises, marks) consistent with a
  struggle in the orientation the victim claims he or she was in at the
  time
- "rape kits" performed by an emergency room physician
- witness testimony confirming that a struggle was directly heard.
  Hearsay is completely useless (i.e. I heard from so-and-so that she
  said no).
- witness testimony immediately following the assault speaking to the
  state of mind of the victim, even if the crime was not immediately
  reported.

Beyond direct physical evidence or direct witness testimony, the span of
time between the alleged attack and any reporting made is also a factor.
Did the victim go immediately (or reasonably quickly) to an emergency
room or call the police, or did the victim wait 20 years before telling
anyone? The quicker the victim reports the attack, the more direct
evidence can be collected, and it also speaks to the consensuality of
the contact.
