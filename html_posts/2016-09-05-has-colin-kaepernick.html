Working a football game is not a required duty of police officers. It is
an ***additional duty*** which takes place during their off-hours (i.e.
like overtime), one that full-time police officers are paid extra to
perform (also like overtime). They can choose to either work or not work
an additional duty.

There is no hostility when an officer chooses to not work an additional
duty. If the department cannot provide that service, the stadium will
have to seek security services from another agency, or from a private
security contractor (at an additional cost).

The only hostility may take place if command staff chooses to **order**
officers to work the additional duty, at which point it changes and is
no longer an additional duty.
