**How can I stop a gun bill from becoming a law, once it\'s passed both
house and senate, before the governor signs it (Vermont)?**

As [[Eric
Erickson](https://www.quora.com/profile/Eric-Erickson)]{.qlink_container}
mentioned, your best bet is to hire an attorney and file a lawsuit and
request the judge file an *injunction* while the lawsuit is in progress.
This means that even if the bill is signed into law, it cannot be
implemented until the legal challenges are heard.

Beyond that, you and your friends should vote out the representatives
who passed the bill if it's against what the majority of the state
wanted.

However, oddly, you may have better luck mounting a Constitutional
challenge *after* it becomes law. Once it does, someone can be affected
by the law. This provides you with a critical piece in the lawsuit game:
**standing**. In order to sue, you have to be someone who was actually
impacted by the law.

Therefore, once the bill becomes law, and someone is prosecuted under
the law, they can then appeal their conviction on the grounds that the
law violates the Constitution. They can do this because they have
standing. They have actually been personally affected by the law, and
they can then claim that their conviction was unjust because the law is
unconstitutional.
