Let's make sure we understand what we're talking about.

Judges do not "enact" law. Legislators do that. Appellate and Supreme
Court judges only determine if laws are Constitutional or not.

So if a state has a right to privacy written into its constitution, and
that state enacts a law (like the one analyzed in the *Roe* case) which
says that a woman has the right to an abortion because of the state's
right to privacy, then a local judge could find that under the state
constitution, that law would be constitutional.

If *Roe* is overturned, then it is because it was found to not have a
valid Constitutional basis. And that's the last word on that. New laws
could be written, but laws could no longer use *Roe* as their basis,
because *Roe* was decided to be unconstitutional. So *Roe*, as it was,
becomes part of history. A state, or Congress, would have to write new
laws providing structure around abortion in that state, or in the US.

Is it possible that local judges may enact ROE versus on a lesser level
