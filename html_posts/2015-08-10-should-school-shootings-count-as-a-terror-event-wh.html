**Content:** [No. Terror events are a political designation, not an
enforcement designation.\
\
Certain terror events, like the Fort Hood shootings, were incorrectly
classified as \"workplace violence,\" or in other words, a disgruntled
employee going crazy, to avoid the appearance of more domestic terror
events.\
\
School shootings are most generally caused by persons who are mentally
unstable or who have some mental disease or defect. Terrorists are
generally of sound mind.]{.rendered_qtext}
