Thanks for the A2A. Note that this is written from a US legal
perspective; other countries may believe differently.

Nothing is \"automatically covered\" by individual rights. In the United
States, the only rights protected are the ones in the Constitution.
Everything else is fair game and is open to restriction by either the
Federal government or by state governments. This includes drugs.

Drugs in the United States are classified based on their potential for
abuse, and their medicinal benefit, as proven through sanctioned
studies. Schedule I drugs have a high potential for abuse, and have no
documented medicinal uses. Marijuana, LSD and magic mushrooms in the
United States are listed on Schedule I.

Schedule II drugs have a high potential for abuse, but have documented
medicinal benefits (and can thus be prescribed by a doctor). It is
interesting to note that both heroin and cocaine are on Schedule II.

(EDIT) The question was amended to state that \"the ban on use of
psychedelics is a violation of the human rights to belief and spiritual
practice, full development of the personality, and free time and play.\"

1.  While psychedelics are used as part of spiritual practice, they are
    not required in order to be spiritual, so they don\'t fall under
    First Amendment religious protections. The Native American tribes of
    the United States made a successful case that peyote should be
    exempted from Schedule I because it is an integral part of their
    religion. If a religion used a psychedelic as an integral part of
    its belief, it may also apply for an exemption, but beyond the
    Native Americans, none have done so. By the way, the Native American
    \"peyote\" case was what prompted then-President Clinton to sign the
    Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which Hobby Lobby successfully
    used to bypass the contraception requirement in the Affordable Care
    Act.
2.  There is no concrete evidence to suggest that the personality of a
    human being does not \"fully develop\" without psychedelics.
3.  Free time and play are not unduly limited by disallowing
    psychedelics. If you believe that your free time and play are
    limited because psychedelics are illegal, you are free to move to
    Austria, where magic mushrooms are legal.
