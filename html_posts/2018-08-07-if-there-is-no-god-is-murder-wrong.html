**If there is no God, is murder wrong?**

This is an excellent question, as it raises the point about the source
of morality.

First of all, the existence of God does not change the laws of man, so
murder would still be illegal even if God did not exist. Therefore, if
you think it's wrong to break a law, then murder would be wrong because
it was illegal.

So let's move past the legal issues here.

We must be talking about morality, since if God doesn't exist, there is
no source of morality. **Without a morals-giver, morals are
self-referential.**

You could argue that people have evolved to have a moral code, but there
is no purpose for morals which aids my personal survival. Morals don't
help me survive. They don't get me food or shelter or drive my
reproductive urges. Therefore, the morals must come from somewhere.

But where do they come from?

That moral code did not come from the universe, since the Law of
Causation says that an effect must resemble its cause. How can a
purposeful, moral, full-of-meaning person come from a random, amoral and
meaningless universe?

That moral code did not come from a social contract; i.e. a group's
ideas about right and wrong. That presupposes that morals are not
universal, but decided by group ideas. What if a group thought that
murder was perfectly fine if it advanced your own personal survival?
What if, in order to survive, I needed your food, and I killed you to
get it, and there was a society that thought that this was okay? Would
murder be wrong then? To that society, it would not be wrong.

You could also argue, as

does, that because murder causes suffering, that murder is inherently
wrong. If causing suffering is wrong, there has to be a reason. There
has to be a moral code which informs us that causing others to suffer is
wrong. But again, where does this moral code come from? Without a giver
of morality, we have no ideas about suffering or murder within us. We
have no inborn moral code. We don't all "just know" that murder is
wrong. Someone must "imprint" that moral code within us. That someone is
God.

Therefore, without God, there is no moral code imprinted in us before
we're born. There is no idea of good or evil. There is just existence.
Survival of the fittest. A prohibition on murder does not help me
survive if I need what you have, so it's no more wrong to murder a
person as it is to murder a cow in order to survive.

**Therefore, if there is no God, murder is not wrong.**
