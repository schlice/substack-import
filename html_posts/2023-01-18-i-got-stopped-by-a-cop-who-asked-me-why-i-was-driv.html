No, that's logic.

- You do have the right to travel freely and unencumbered.
- You must have a driver's license to drive a car.

Those two statements do not contradict each other.

Why not? If I have the right to travel freely and unencumbered, then no
one can tell me whether or not I can drive a car, right?

Not exactly. You indeed can travel freely and unencumbered. You can move
freely from state to state, and no one will ever ask for a travel visa.
No one will demand to see your "papers" when you leave one state and
enter another. You never need an appointment to leave a state and enter
another state.

But how, pray tell, do you get to this new state? Any way you choose!
You can walk. You can ride in a bus. You can ride in a car. You can ride
in a plane. You can ride a bicycle.

But while you can *ride* in a car, being the operator of a motor vehicle
on a state-owned road requires that you have training and insurance. The
Supreme Court has said many times that the state has the right to
require you to have a driver's license, as part of its police powers and
its ability to make law and enforce them. Laws which require you to have
a license in no way limit your ability to travel freely and
unencumbered. They only limit your ability to **operate** a motor
vehicle, not to **be a passenger** in one. Again, *this does not limit
your rights in any way,* and it permits the state to maintain a safe
environment for all of its residents, which is a compelling state
interest.

And by the way, spouting off sovereign citizen crap to cops is the
easiest way to get them to completely shut down and treat you by the
book.

Original question:

I got stopped by a cop who asked me why I was driving on a suspended
license and I told him because I had the right to travel freely and
unencumbered and he replied, \"that\'s nonsense\". Is that treason?
