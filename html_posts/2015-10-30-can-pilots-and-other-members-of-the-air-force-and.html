**Content:** [***Effectively***, meaning in such a way as to force the
commanders and civilians in charge to make a decision in a particular
way?\
\
Nope.\
\
Maybe you\'re a little unclear on how the military works.\
\
If I really wanted to be a dick to someone who I outranked (and that
very rarely happened \-- I distinctly remember a Staff Sergeant mouthing
off to me at one time, and I was a Captain at the time), I\'d tell them,
\"OK, I\'ll flip \'ya for it,\" meaning if they win the proverbial
\"coin toss,\" they could have it their way. I\'d then flip an imaginary
coin in the air, catching it on my shoulder (covering my rank). When
I\'d reveal my rank underneath, I\'d say, \"Oh darn, I win.\"\
\
Petitions really aren\'t a part of the military ethos.\
\
The point of that story? The general outranks the pilots. When the
general (and the civilians in charge of the general) makes a decision,
that\'s it. Petitions might be a good way to gauge the feeling amongst
the pilots, but understanding that most of those generals are pilots
themselves, I bet they understand those same feelings already, so a
petition is not likely necessary.\
\
You may not know that the current CSAF, General Mark A. Welsh, was a
Hawg driver himself. Unfortunately, sometimes generals need to make the
hard decisions, and that may include cutting a beloved workhorse of the
Air Force. He said, \"We used the standard DoD planning scenarios. The
results very clearly showed that cutting the A-10 fleet was the
lowest-risk option, from an operational perspective, of a bunch of bad
options. While no one is happy, from a military perspective, it\'s the
right decision, and it\'s representative of the extremely difficult
choices that we\'re facing in the budget today.\" (*Checkpoints,* Dec,
2014, p. 16)\
\
As General Welsh said, cutting the A-10 is the lowest-risk option of a
bunch of bad options. It\'s the best of all the bad choices out there.\

[[Bill Stein\'s answer to Given its history of success, including
current combat against ISIL, why does the U.S. Air Force seek to cut
funding of the A-10 Thunderbolt (\"Warthog\")? Shouldn\'t they embrace
it as one of their best aircraft? Could the Navy etc. adopt it at
least?](https://www.quora.com/Given-its-history-of-success-including-current-combat-against-ISIL-why-does-the-U-S-Air-Force-seek-to-cut-funding-of-the-A-10-Thunderbolt-Warthog-Shouldnt-they-embrace-it-as-one-of-their-best-aircraft-Could-the-Navy-etc-adopt-it-at-least/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container}]{.rendered_qtext}
