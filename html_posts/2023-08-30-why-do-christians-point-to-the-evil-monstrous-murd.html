Where do non-Christians get the basis for determining what is evil and
monstrous? What moral basis is the non-Christian using to determine that
God is somehow evil?

As to murder, murder is the unjustified killing of a person. Except
every time God killed someone (or ordered His people to do it), He
already judged them. So is it murder when we kill a Death Row convict?
No, because the killing is justified. Same with God.
