The answer to your question is **yes**. ***IF*** people who are never
told about Christianity go to heaven because they had no chance to
learn, it would be better for us Christians to tell nobody about it.

Which begs the question: ***do people who are never told about
Christianity go to heaven?***

The answer to *that* question is **no. People do not automatically go to
heaven if they never heard about Christ during their lives.**

As others have pointed out:

> Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes
> to the Father except through me." --- John 14:6 NIV

The only way to the Father is through Jesus. It is only faith in Christ
which is a saving faith.

Additionally, all people are accountable to God whether or not they have
"heard about Him." The Bible tells us that God has clearly revealed
Himself in nature:

> For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities---his
> eternal power and divine nature---have been clearly seen, being
> understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.
> --- Romans 1:20 NIV

God has also been clearly revealed in the hearts of people:

> He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity
> in the human heart; yet no one can fathom what God has done from
> beginning to end. --- Ecclesiastes 3:11 NIV

The problem is that the human race is sinful; we reject this knowledge
of God and rebel against Him:

> For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave
> thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish
> hearts were darkened. Although they claimed to be wise, they became
> fools and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to
> look like a mortal human being and birds and animals and reptiles ---
> Romans 1:21-23 NIV

If it were not for God's salvific grace, we would be given over to the
sinful desires of our hearts, and we would perish. So the reality is not
that people haven't heard of God. The reality is that people have
rejected what they have seen in nature and has been written in their
hearts. If they were to not reject what they have seen in nature, and if
they were to seek Him, they would find Him.

> But if from there you seek the Lord your God, you will find him if you
> seek him with all your heart and with all your soul. --- Deuteronomy
> 4:29 NIV

But no one seeks Him:

> there is no one who understands;\
> there is no one who seeks God. --- Romans 3:11 NIV

The Bible is telling us that people reject the truth of God seen in
nature and written in their hearts. But those people are responsible to
God for their response to that knowledge. The Bible doesn't say anything
about how unfair it is for those who simply haven't heard the Gospel.
The Bible says that people have rejected the knowledge they already
have. Therefore, God is just in allowing them to choose hell.

\

That said, we should not be debating how fair it is for people who
haven't heard the Gospel to be condemned to hell. **We should be
focusing on our own responsibility in this situation.**

That responsibility is the Great Commission.

> Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on
> earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all
> nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and
> of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have
> commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the
> age." --- Matthew 28:18--20 NIV

Rather than focusing on whether or not people who have never heard the
Gospel will go to hell, we should be focusing on how we can reach these
people and ensure that they have had an opportunity to hear the Gospel.
As we have discussed, people reject the knowledge they have learned from
nature and their own hearts. As such, it is even more imperative that we
reach them with the Gospel message. Because in this case, it is only the
grace of God through Christ that will save them.
