As far as I know, those statistics are not tracked, or widely publicized
if they are. Where you grew up is a more meaningful statistic than where
you live now.

Epidemiologists know that people who spent the first 15 years of their
lives above 40° north latitude tend to have higher rates of MS than
those who lived below 40°.
