Why isn't the Cosmological Argument enough proof that God exists?

The Cosmological Argument is very simple:

1.  Everything that has a beginning has a cause.
2.  The universe has a beginning.
3.  Therefore, the universe has a cause.

That's it.

Premise 1 is the Law of Causality, one of the foundational laws of
science. Even the outspoken atheist David Hume said, "I never asserted
so absurd a proposition as that something should arise without a cause."
So Premise 1 is true.

Is Premise 2 true? We know from a tremendous amount of scientific
research that the whole, entire universe (that means all of time, space,
and matter) began at a single point. We have colloquially called this
the "Big Bang." There is a lot of scientific data which supports the
veracity of the Big Bang: the second law of thermodynamics, the
expanding (and accelerating) universe, the radiation echo from the Big
Bang, galaxy seeds, and the most convincing of all, Einstein's Theory of
General Relativity. All of this data (and more) point unequivocally to
the understanding that the universe had a beginning.

Still, some deny that the Big Bang was actually the beginning of time,
space, and matter. Maybe matter began then, but time and space existed
before, they say without any evidence of this. And maybe they're right.
But when you have two maybe's, it's generally best to go with the
"maybe" that has the most proof. And right now, Einstein's Theory of
General Relativity (which has now been proven accurate to five decimal
places) states that *everything* began at a single point. Nothing
existed before that point. You didn't have matter in any sort of state
before that point because it would have had to exist *someplace* and
there was no space for the matter to exist in. The matter would have had
to exist in a time before the Big Bang, but there was no time before the
Big Bang, so that theory is out.

Einstein was an atheist, and he was greatly troubled by his own
findings, which were showing him that the universe was finite. In fact,
he was so troubled by this, that he introduced a *cosmological constant*
(think of it as a "fudge factor") into the theory, to show that the
universe was actually static and infinite.

However, his fudge factor didn't last long. In 1919, British cosmologist
Arthur Eddington conducted an experiment during a solar eclipse which
confirmed that the universe wasn't static, but indeed had a beginning.
Eddington, also an atheist, said of the discovery, "Philosophically, the
notion of the beginning of the present order of nature is repugnant to
me...I should like to find a genuine loophole." And by 1922, Russian
mathematician Alexander Friedmann had officially exposed Einstein's
fudge factor as a mathematical error. Einstein, in his haste to disprove
his own theory, *had actually divided by zero*.

Einstein was *so shook* by his own discovery that he became a theist! In
1929, he traveled to California to visit the Mount Wilson Observatory,
where he saw with his own eyes the red shift in the movement of
celestial objects indicative of them all moving away from a central
point. It was then that he knew: the universe must have a beginning, and
thus a Beginner. He subsequently described the cosmological constant as
"the greatest blunder of my life." He said that he wanted "to know how
God created the world. I am not interested in this or that phenomenon,
in the spectrum of this or that element. I want to know His thought, the
rest are details."

So we know that everything that had a beginning had a cause, and that
the universe had a beginning. So therefore, the universe must have a
cause. So Conclusion 1 (numbered 3 above) must also be true.

But this leaves us with yet another question: what (or Who) caused the
universe? Does it have to be God? Does this even prove that a god
exists? Well, let's go back to the Law of Causality for assistance. The
Law of Causality also states that an effect must resemble its cause. So
can we tell anything about the creator of the universe (the cause) from
the universe (the effect)? Actually, we can tell quite a lot. We know
that whoever created the universe must be someone who exists outside of
it (because He created the universe and is therefore not bound by it).
It also must be someone who is timeless (as He exists outside of time
and is also not bound by it). So we are looking for an infinite being
who exists outside of the universe.

What else can we tell about Him from His creation?

- He must be supernatural in nature (as He created time and space).
- He must be powerful (incredibly).
- He must be necessary (the maker must be self-explanatory).
- He must be omnipresent (He created space and is not limited by it).
- He must be immaterial because He transcends space/physical.
- He must be personal (the impersonal cannot create personality).
- He must be infinite and singular as you cannot have two infinites.
- He must be diverse yet have unity as unity and diversity exist
  simultaneously in nature.
- He must be intelligent (supremely). Only cognitive being can produce
  cognitive being.
- He must be purposeful as He deliberately created everything.
- He must be moral (no moral law can be had without a giver).
- He must be caring (or no moral laws would have been given).

That said, does any religion of the world describe such a Creator? The
answer is yes, the Abrahamic God of the Bible does in fact fit these
criteria completely.

The only other point I want to make about the atheistic belief that
there is no god is how justifiable that position is. Since the atheist
asserts that the believer's position is unsound, it is only fair to turn
the same question back on him, and look at just how "sound" the atheist
position is.

The claim made by atheism ("no god") is untenable from a philosophical
perspective. As legal scholar and philosopher Mortimer Adler says, \"An
affirmative existential proposition can be proved, but a negative
existential proposition\--one that denies the existence of
something\--cannot be proved.\" For example, let's say that I said that
purple eagles exist, and you said that purple eagles do not exist. I
would need to find only one example of a purple eagle to prove my
assertion. You would have to comb the entire universe and literally be
in every place at once to ensure you have not missed a purple eagle
somewhere and at some time, which is impossible to do. This is why
intellectually honest atheists will admit they cannot prove God does not
exist.

We also must discuss the seriousness of the truth claims made by atheism
and the amount of evidence required to warrant such conclusions. For
example, if someone puts two containers of lemonade in front of you and
says that one may be more tart than the other, since the consequences of
getting the more tart drink would not be serious, you would not require
a large amount of evidence in order to make your choice. However, if to
one cup the host added sweetener but to the other he added rat poison,
then you would want to have quite a bit of evidence before you made your
choice.

This is where a person sits when they are deciding between theism and
atheism. Since belief in atheism could possibly result in irreparable
and eternal consequences, it would seem that the atheist should be
mandated to produce weighty and overriding evidence to support their
position, but they cannot. **Atheism simply cannot meet the test for
evidence for the seriousness of the charge it makes.** Instead, the
atheist and those whom they convince of their position slide into
eternity with their fingers crossed and hope they do not find the
unpleasant truth that eternity does indeed exist and that such a place
is an awfully long time to be wrong. As Mortimer Adler says, "More
consequences for life and action follow from the affirmation or denial
of God than from any other basic question."

TL;DR: Providing proof doesn't upset theists at all. The problem comes
when people refuse to accept the proof.
