There are no legal options against these things. There are only options
for fighting them after they happen.

If you get pulled over without probable cause that a traffic violation
occurred or that there is criminal activity happening, you can argue
that the stop was unlawful.

If your car is searched but the officer did not have probable cause to
do so, you can argue that the search was unlawful and anything found in
the search is inadmissible.

If your municipality has a law which says that officers clocking traffic
must be in plain sight, or in marked vehicles, or have at a minimum
marker lights turned on, and you were clocked by an officer not meeting
the minimum standard as required in your jurisdiction, you can argue
that the stop was unlawful.

You cannot ***prevent*** the traffic stop from happening. You cannot
***prevent*** the search from happening. If the officer demands to
search your car, you can decline because he needs probable cause or a
warrant, but if he insists anyway, you must allow him to proceed.

However, if the legal standards were not met, you and your attorney can
argue that later. The officer must follow the law or the stop will be
ruled unlawful and any evidence found inadmissible.
