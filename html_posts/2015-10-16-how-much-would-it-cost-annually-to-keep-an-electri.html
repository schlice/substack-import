**Content:** [I don\'t agree that we should build a wall. Or a fence. I
don\'t really care how you made it here, or why. We need to do a better
job of enforcing the laws we already have. That money could be better
spent fixing immigration.\
\
Once you make it more attractive to come here legally than you do to
come here illegally, the problem fixes itself.\
\
The immigration system needs a complete overhaul. It needs to work much
faster and it needs to allow more people who wish to emigrate to this
country.\
\
Once we do that, we need to step up the laws against employing someone
who is illegally present in this country.\
\
Next, we stop giving handouts (free education, driver\'s licenses, etc)
to people in this country illegally.\
\
Finally, once those are in place, we need to start funneling illegals
who refuse to become citizens and refuse to leave swiftly out the door.
It shouldn\'t be too difficult to come back as legal citizens once we
overhaul immigration.\
\
From then on, no one will want to come into the country illegally.\
\
Yes, it\'s a long, hard road. But so is building a
wall.]{.rendered_qtext}
