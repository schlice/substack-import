**If husband walks out on family. What rights does he have to ask for
full time custody of children?**

The answer is, of course, "it depends," because each state governs its
divorce laws individually.

However, in most states, custody and child support are determined based
on the best interests of the child, not based on who initiated the
divorce, or even in a fault divorce, who was at fault.
