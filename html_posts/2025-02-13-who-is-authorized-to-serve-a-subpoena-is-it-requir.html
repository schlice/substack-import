As with any legal question, the answer is "it depends."

In most states, the Sheriff or a Sheriff's Deputy can serve subpoenas.
Some states include the Coroner as someone who can serve subpoenas
(interestingly, as a side note, usually it's only the Coroner who can
arrest the Sheriff). And also usually, anyone who is 18 years old or
older who is not a party to the case can serve the subpoena. This person
is called a **process server.** Some states require process servers to
be licensed or registered with the state or county.

Many people choose to hire professional process servers, who are
experienced in serving legal documents and are knowledgeable about local
regulations. While not always mandatory, some states may require process
servers to complete a training program or obtain certification.

- A process server should not have a criminal record, especially
  felonies, that could raise questions about their credibility and
  integrity.
- Some states may require process servers to hold a surety bond or
  liability insurance to protect clients and themselves from potential
  legal claims.
- Beyond that, most states do not require any specific training to be
  registered as a process server.

Here in North Carolina, civil service of process is restricted to the
Sheriff, a Sheriff's Deputy, or the County Coroner. However, if the
Sheriff's Office returns the process unexecuted, then anyone 21 years or
older and not a party to the case, nor related by blood or marriage to
any party in the case, can serve the documents.

Be sure to check with a licensed attorney in your jurisdiction, or check
with the clerk of the court where your case is being heard, in order to
determine the proper procedure to have documents served.
