**Content:** [Two valid points. I guess I\'ll dive into it then.\
\
1. You are correct that atheists do not make a positive claim; they make
a negative claim. Making a negative claim is a claim in and of itself:
there is no god. In order for that claim to be believable, you can\'t
just say \"it\'s believable because you haven\'t proven that your theory
is believable.\" Belief in God is not innocent until proven guilty. If
you are going to be a student of any theistic philosophy (atheism
included), you have to be able to prove your own belief, or you\'re just
fooling yourself by saying, \"you haven\'t convinced me, therefore I\'m
right.\" Proving your belief by saying you haven\'t proven yours is no
proof whatsoever. You have to offer empirical evidence that god does not
exist.\
\
2. Pascal\'s Wager is an interesting philosophical thought exercise, but
isn\'t a way to explain religion. It treats religion as nothing more
than a cost/benefit analysis instead of a way to pattern your life. In
other words, you\'re missing the point if the only reason you believe in
a god or not believe in a god is to achieve heaven, or not achieve
heaven.\
\
It seems, however, when trying to find credible reasons to believe in
god, atheists like to reduce the argument to this sort of cost/benefit
analysis. Logic alone can bring you closer to the truth, but only faith
can lead you to accept the truth in God\'s word.\
\
I can present many logical arguments as to the fact that there is a
creator using logic, science and philosophy. But even that won\'t bring
a person to faith.\
\
For example, the story in the Bible of Thomas (the doubter) who did not
believe that Jesus rose from the dead until he touched the nail holes in
His hands. Jesus said, in essence, \"Good on you for believing after you
touched, but blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe.\" That
is the essence of faith. Faith is belief without empirical evidence. The
evidence I do have backs up what I already believe by faith.\
\
I re-word Pascal\'s Wager in this way: if I am wrong, and there is no
god, I\'ve lost nothing. But if you are wrong, and there is a god,
you\'ve lost everything. And eternity is an awfully long time to be
wrong.]{.rendered_qtext}
