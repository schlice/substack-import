**My friend is accused of a crime. The police want to interview me, they
say I don't need an attorney? What should I do?**

Here's the problem.

If you knew something about what your friend did, would you willingly
hand that information over? Would you willingly screw your friend over?

Now ask yourself: do you think it's a fair bet that the police know
this?

Therefore, why exactly would they believe in their wildest dreams that
you'd walk into that police station and willingly hand your friend over
to them on a silver platter? Even bad friends aren't that awful. Well,
maybe some are, but most aren't.

*Isn't it more likely that they actually do have something on you? And
they plan on using it against you when you arrive? And they want to
elicit a confession from you implicating your friend without the messy
involvement of lawyers and such?*

Don't go in there without a lawyer.
