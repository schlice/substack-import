Committing crimes is not hard. It's no harder to sell your gun illegally
than it is to sell it legally. The "black market" is simply when you
don't follow the law and/or regulations when you buy or sell your gun.
The reason you sell your gun legally is because it protects **you**. If
you sell your gun to someone who uses it to commit a crime and they
manage to trace the gun back to you, some will seek to hold you liable
for having a part in the crime. Now, I know that this is a tough
connection for them to make, but they will try, at great personal
expense to both your wallet and your reputation.

Add to this the fact that you will be discovered as illegally selling a
weapon, and the consequences could be staggering, as you can be
separately prosecuted for that crime (which you actually did do), and
that's a felony. You're looking at a minimum of a year in jail and more
fines.

Finally, as if that wasn't enough, you then want to lie to your
insurance company and claim that your property was stolen. In order to
do this, you need to file a police report. If you make it through the
investigation (and you're not the first person to ever sell stuff and
claim it was stolen), you have committed another crime: filing a false
report. If you then take the false report and make an insurance claim
using it, you have committed *yet another* crime: insurance fraud.

Personally, I don't think the best remedy for committing a crime is to
commit *more crimes.*

So it's not that it is difficult to do. It's the consequences which
could be difficult to live with if you are caught.
