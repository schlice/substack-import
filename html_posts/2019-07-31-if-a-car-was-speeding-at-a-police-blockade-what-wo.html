While I agree with [[Brian
Parramore](https://www.quora.com/profile/Brian-Parramore)]{.qlink_container}
that any centerfire rifle fired multiple times at the radiator will
disable the vehicle, the question was asked about which gun would be the
***best*** gun to slow it down or stop it.

And the ***best*** gun the police have access to would be this:

The Barrett M107. This behemoth fires the similarly behemoth 50BMG
round:

The bullet on the far right is a .22 Long Rifle (LR). The next bullet to
the left is the 5.56 NATO, which is fired by most centerfire rifles such
as the M4 or the M-16. And all the way on the far left of the photo is
the .50 BMG, fired by the Barrett.

The 5.56 travels at a maximum of around 3,100 ft/sec and imparts around
1,371 ft/lbs of force. The .50 BMG, on the other hand, at its heaviest
800 grain Barnes configuration, flies at a relatively slow 2,895 ft/sec,
but imparts a *whopping* 14,895 ft/lbs of force on target.

So will a 5.56 do the job? Yes, probably with more than one shot, but it
will stop the car. But will a Barrett do the job better? In all
respects, yes.
