**If you were sitting in a public place such as a bus or a movie theater
(pre-COVID) somebody sat next to you even though they were other seats
available, would you ask them to move, and would you file a lawsuit
against them if they refused?**

You said pre-COVID, so we're talking a world before COVID ever was a
thing.

Someone came and sat next to you on a bus, or in a theater. It's a
public seat, they have every right to sit in that seat next to you. Just
because other open seats exist doesn't mean they must take them. The
seat next to you is just as available as any other seat.

You have no legal grounds to file a lawsuit because they chose a
publicly available seat. There's no law that says people must practice
social distancing. Remember, this is before "social distancing" entered
our vocabulary full-time.
