As far as I can find, Trump never said that he would lose. What he *has*
done is backed off of his usual rhetoric of Biden being a "low-IQ
individual" who is "the worst, most incompetent, and most corrupt
president" in the nation's history.

Last I heard, when he was on the *All In* podcast, he did soften his
rhetoric on Biden. "I assume he's going to be somebody that will be a
worthy debater," he said. "I don't want to underestimate him.\"

"Maybe I'm better off losing the debate,\" Trump commented in an
interview with *Real America's Voice* earlier this month. "I'll make
sure he stays. I'll lose the debate on purpose, maybe I'll do something
like that."

He also commented during the *All In* podcast about Biden's debate with
Paul Ryan in the run-up to the 2012 presidential election: "Well, all I
can say is this: I watched him with Paul Ryan, and he destroyed Paul
Ryan," said Trump. "So I'm not underestimating him. I'm not
underestimating him. It is what it is. We'll see what happens."

The rhetoric may be toned down, but the advice is correct. He's walking
into the lion's den, into a debate moderated by the anti-Trump network
CNN. He rightly posited, "I'll be debating three people instead of one
half of a person," at a rally in Racine, Wisconsin last week.

Legacy media sources read this situation as Trump setting up excuses in
the event he does poorly. But this may very well be because some
concerns have been raised by some in his party that he has set the bar
so low for Biden that he is sure to exceed it. And it underscores the
stakes for both men in a race that has appeared largely static for
months.
