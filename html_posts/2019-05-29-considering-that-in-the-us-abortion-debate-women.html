**Considering the risk of pregnancy and that only women's bodies are
being politicized around the US abortion debate, should it be considered
assault to ejaculate inside another person without their consent?**

No, for several reasons.

First, I'll ignore your "consideration" because it's a red herring, and
there's a lot we could say about the "risks" of pregnancy and
politicization of the abortion debate, and none of it has anything to do
with crime.

The only time that consent is required is before sex starts. Sex with
consent is legal, sex without consent is illegal. It's usually called
*rape*. (EDIT) Because people are misinterpreting that last sentence as
meaning ***only*** the first consent counts (which is not what I meant),
let me clarify: a woman can withdraw that initial consent at any time.
But that's really not what we're talking about.

Even without ejaculation, the seminal fluid at the tip of the penis
contains enough sperm to successfully inseminate a woman. So the risk of
pregnancy is still non-zero any time you engage in sex, ejaculation or
not.

This highlights the fact (which everyone seems to be missing) that **the
whole point of sex is to make babies**. If you don't consent to the
possibility that you may make a baby, you should probably avoid sex.
Because *each and every time you consent to sex, both initially and
ongoing, you imply that you consent to making a baby, because, as
previously mentioned,* ***consent to sex implies consent to making a
baby. These consents are not, and cannot, be separated.***

Otherwise, this scenario becomes a crime:

*\<sex ongoing\>*\
"Don't cum in me, okay?"\
"M'kay"\
*\<sex continues\>*\
"Don't cum in me, okay?"\
"M'kay"\
*\<sex continues\>*\
"Don't cum in me, okay?"\
"..............oops"

Are you proposing that *this* becomes a crime?
