Department policies are all different, but there are several reasons why
officers are not legally responsible for providing medical attention:

1.  If an officer is solo, he has other concerns at that moment
    following a shooting, not the least of which is his continuing
    safety. He has to secure the scene, control the bystanders, and make
    sure none of them want to take immediate revenge for the shooting.
    Emotions run high, but the officer cannot focus on anything else
    until backup arrives. If an officer has a partner with him who can
    assist with securing the scene, and they don\'t have any other
    immediate safety or security concerns, the officer can then provide
    basic medical attention, but two-officer cars are becoming more and
    more rare these days.
2.  Once backup arrives, the officer in question is generally taken
    aside so that evidence can be preserved (i.e. his duty weapon will
    be taken into evidence, GSR tests will be run, etc). The officer\'s
    priority is still not the suspect at that point.
3.  Officers are generally not trained as EMTs. Officers are usually
    only trained as first responders (CPR/FA/AED), but not generally as
    EMTs. There is only so much that an officer can do before the EMTs
    arrive.
