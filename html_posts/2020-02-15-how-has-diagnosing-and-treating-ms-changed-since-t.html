Thanks for your question,

MS treatment from the 60s to today are like the most polar opposites you
can think of. Fire and ice. Wet and dry. Old and new. I have answered a
similar question
[[previously](https://www.quora.com/What-advances-have-been-made-in-the-treatment-of-Multiple-Sclerosis/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container},
but I'll answer here as well.

In the 60s, we didn't have any medications which actually treated the
disease itself. We could only treat the symptoms caused by relapses when
they happened, and we didn't even do that effectively. We had steroids
for the inflammation during a relapse, and we could treat the symptoms
individually, but we had nothing to actually touch the disease. In the
60s, the disease advanced unfettered.

Then, we had a revolutionary breakthrough, and things took off.

In the 90's, a class of drugs formerly used to treat cancer patients was
approved to treat MS. That class of drugs is called *interferons*. Two
interferons, interferon-1A and interferon-1B (based on the original
proteins from which they are derived) were marketed as Avonex and
Betaseron respectively. This was the first time we had a medication
which could actually slow down the progression of the disease and lessen
its impact. This was revolutionary in the treatment of the disease.

But its effects were limited. Interferons only seemed to be effective on
relapsing forms of the disease, and efficacy (how effective the drug is)
was not wonderful. Those with progressive forms of the disease were
still out of luck.

We have advanced even further since then. We now have some medications
which are approved to treat progressive forms of MS. We even have one
medication specifically designed for a symptom of MS (Ampyra is
specifically designed to help MS patients who have difficulty walking),
and that's a first. All of our other treatments for symptoms were
originally targeted at other diseases.

Our medications have advanced beyond interferons. We have synthetic
proteins (Copaxone) and medications which prevent immune cells from
crossing the blood-brain barrier (Tysabri). We have oral medications now
(Tecfidera, Aubagio, Gilenya), rather than just intra-muscular (IM) or
sub-cutaneous (SC) injectables. The aforementioned Tysabri is an
infusion, administered at an infusion center every four weeks. The
newest infusion-based medication (Ocrevus) is administered by infusion
once every six months.

This is all great news for MS patients. However, I want to caution you.
Our suite of MS medications only slows down the progression of the
disease and lessens the impact of relapses. It does nothing to reverse
the disease course. We can't yet rebuild myelin or remove the plaques
(scleroses) on nerve fibers. If there is significant gliosis (damage) to
oligodendrocytes, we cannot reverse that damage. And while this may be
challenging to hear, it's unlikely that at your mother's age, starting
on a new regimen of MS medication (which comes with a whole host of side
effects and risk factors) would be seen as beneficial.

Clearly, this is something that your mother should discuss with her
neurologist, but I would be remiss if I didn't warn you what the answer
will likely be.

That said, we have plenty of advanced treatments to help with symptoms,
and like I mentioned, Ampyra is approved to treat walking issues in MS
patients. So while our MS treatments themselves may not be appropriate,
there have been incredible advances in treating the symptoms of the
disease, and she may benefit from those treatments in easing her
symptoms. There have also been advances in speech therapy, and she may
benefit from a visit to a Speech and Language Pathologist (SLP) to help
her work through her speech issues. Even if they can't treat the damaged
area of the brain, other areas of the brain will frequently take up the
slack --- with training and therapy. A SLP can help with that.

Despite what I've said, **this is not a diagnosis**. It's still worth
her time to discuss these new medications and treatments with her
neurologist, and for her to learn how they might help her live better
with MS.
