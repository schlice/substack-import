No, because his plea deal only included 30 days jail time.

It sounds a bit harsh. And it would be, if you had actually represented
the facts of the case correctly.

The former LA County Sheriff's deputy, Andrew Lyons, was charged with
one felony count each of assault with a semiautomatic firearm and
assault under the color of authority. There's no murder charge there.
There's no manslaughter charge there. In fact, there are no "killing"
charges there at all.

So despite what you asked, there is no proof that Andrew Lyons killed
Ryan Twyman.

How do I know this?

**The prosecution refused to continue manslaughter charges against Mr.
Lyons.**

Lyons had originally been charged with involuntary manslaughter and two
felony counts of assault with an assault weapon. He accepted a plea deal
and pled down to assault with a semiautomatic firearm and assault under
the color of authority. He was sentenced to two years probation and 30
days in jail. He also is permanently barred from owning a firearm.

So for what he was *actually* charged with, his sentence seems
reasonable.

But if you're so sure that Andrew Lyons killed Ryan Twyman, *why didn't
the prosecutor charge him with murder or manslaughter?*

Because there were *two* deputies who fired a total of four bullets that
struck Twyman. A full investigation by the LA County Sheriff's
Department resulted in no definitive determination as to which bullet
from which gun killed Ryan Twyman.

Knowing that they couldn't get a conviction on murder or manslaughter
charges, they knew the best they could get was assault with a
semiautomatic firearm and assault under color of authority. So they let
him plead out.

Lyons' attorney stated the following after the trial:

\"From the outset, we have stated this is a case based in politics, not
facts. The facts in this case demonstrate that Mr. Lyons did not kill
Mr. Twyman. The dismissal of the voluntary manslaughter charge by the
District Attorney\'s Office underscores this truth. Mr. Lyons has
reluctantly agreed to accept a plea in this matter and to end his
15-year law enforcement career out of his belief that it is in the best
interest of his family.\"[\[1\]](#dlpuD){#cite-dlpuD .citation_link}
