**Can you stop blocked numbers from leaving voicemail?**

The answer is it depends on where the call is blocked.

If you are blocking the call at your device, it is technically still
"ringing" even though you don't hear it and you don't get a
notification. It will ring through to your voicemail and they can leave
a message. In some cases, this may be desired behavior, and in others,
it may not be.

If your carrier is blocking the call, whether or not they send the call
to voicemail is entirely up to them and the settings they allow you to
make for blocked numbers. They may allow you to indicate whether or not
you want the call to go to voicemail or simply be dropped.

I would reach out to my carrier and see if they can help you with
configuring call blocking at the carrier level, and configuring what
happens to blocked numbers.
