No.

The old Christian children's song goes:

> Oh be careful little eyes what you see,\
> Oh be careful little eyes what you see,\
> For the Father up above is looking down with love,\
> So be careful little eyes what you see.

Jesus also (more graphically) talked about the sins which enter the body
through the eyes when He said the following in the Sermon on the Mount:

> And if your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It
> is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and
> be thrown into the fire of hell. ---Matthew 18:9 NIV

Now, Jesus wasn't really talking about body mutilation, and children
don't know if something is desirable until they see it first. What these
songs and passages are talking about is the truth to the old adage that
*the eyes are the window to the soul*. What you let in through your eyes
will eventually worm its way into your soul.

Indeed, the path to sin is the same for most of us: I saw it, I desired
it, I took it, I hid from the consequences. **I saw, I desired, I took,
I hid.**

Remember the song "Hallelujah" by Leonard Cohen?

> Your faith was strong but you needed proof\
> You saw her bathing on the roof\
> Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya

He was talking about King David, when he saw Bathsheba bathing one
night.

> Then it happened one evening that David arose from his bed and walked
> on the roof of the king's house. And from the roof he saw a woman
> bathing, and the woman was very beautiful to behold. --- 2 Samuel 11:2

Even though she was married to one of his guards, he desired her anyway.
And after he took her, he covered up his crime by killing his guard.

Seeing her on the roof was an accident, a mistake. **The sin happened
when he didn't look away**. He allowed the vision to enter his soul, and
his vision turned into the sin of lust.

So how does all of this relate to *Harry Potter*?

The *Harry Potter* books are a **story**. They are fiction. They do not
depict reality. People all over the world know this. We know there
really isn't a Hogwart's or a Hagrid or a Hermione or a Snape and there
never was, but it's fun to pretend.

But what we see with the eyes (including what we read) can burrow its
way into our soul and possibly cause us to sin.

The primary Christian objections to *Harry Potter* are that it is a
pagan text and that it encourages children to oppose authority (because
of Harry's rejection of the Dursley's, his adoptive family). These
claims are utter nonsense because 1. *Harry Potter* is not a religious
book and never claimed to be, and 2. the Dursley's were *objectively
evil* and Harry was right to oppose them.

Christians also claim that the *Potter* series is a sort of "gateway
drug" that will lead children away from Christianity and into Paganism
or Wicca or any other number of cults.

To that claim, I offer the beginning of this answer. "Be careful, little
eyes, what you see." Understand what you are looking at, know that it is
pure fantasy, and enjoy it for what it is, and nothing more.

If you have trouble distinguishing reality from fantasy, maybe *Harry
Potter* isn't the book you should be reading.
