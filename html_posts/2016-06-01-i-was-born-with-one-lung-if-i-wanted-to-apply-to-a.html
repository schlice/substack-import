**Content:** [That's a tough one. Navy standards say that
**pneumonectomy**, or removal of one lung, is disqualifying. Lobectomy
is also disqualifying, as is a history of surgery in the chest. However,
lung agenesis (or congenital absence of a lung) is not explicitly called
out as a disqualifying condition.\
\
However, there are still a number of other things that could potentially
cause you to fail the medical entrance exam, not the least of which is
the fact that your total lung volume is half of what everyone else has.
You may not be able to pass the pulmonary function tests with the
appropriate pulmonary function to be deemed medically qualified.\
\
For most service academy appointments, if you are otherwise qualified to
attend a service academy, the admissions department will process a
medical waiver request for you. They will want to see that you can pass
a pulmonary function test and that you have a history of successful
participation in normal cardiovascular activity. They may schedule you
for additional tests, but in the end, it's up to the people at DODMERB
(DoD Medical Examination and Review Board) to determine if the condition
is waiverable.]{.rendered_qtext}
