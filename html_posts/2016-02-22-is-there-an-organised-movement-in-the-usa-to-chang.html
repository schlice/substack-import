In the United States, the problem is not with the correctional system.
The problem is with the medical community.

The largest quantity of the prison population is there [[because of
drugs or drug-related
offenses](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ee4045&url=https://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/statistics_inmate_offenses.jsp){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="bop.gov"}]{.qlink_container}. By orders of magnitude. And
most of those are drug **users**, not drug **dealers**.

Fundamentally, this is due to a flaw in the **medical system**, which
chooses to treat drug addicts as \"bad actors\" instead of people with a
disease. Medical science has, as of today, been unable to quantify the
exact mechanisms within the brain which are affected by the disease of
addiction. Since they have been unable to do so, addicts are not treated
as patients. Since the medical community does not see them as ill, the
only other choice for their behavior is, well, choice. The addict must
therefore be choosing to do drugs; he is not unable to control himself
because of a disease. Therefore, if he does not have a disease, he must
be a criminal.

For this reason, the jails are teeming with drug addicts.

When the medical community can finally find the exact pathways in the
brain which are affected by addiction, we can start to treat addicts as
**patients** instead of **prisoners**. The effect on the prison system
will be overwhelming. The government can divert some money that was
normally sent to prisons to drug rehabilitation centers, and the effect
on drug addiction will be staggering.

But it all comes down to the greater medical community to fix.
