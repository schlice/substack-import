**When you do a factory reset to your phone to get rid of malware, and
you do a back up first, won\'t you be backing up the malware too?**

The answer, of course, is "it depends." Primarily, it depends on the
source of the malware. Secondarily, it depends on whether or not you are
rooted and what kind of wipe/restore you are performing.

For the sake of discussion, I'll assume we're talking about Android,
because malware is more likely to occur in the Android ecosystem than in
the Apple ecosystem, especially because Android allows "Unknown Sources"
(i.e. APK files downloaded off of the Internet) to be used to install
apps on your device.

The theory revolves around the fact that when you wipe and re-install,
your Google backup does not contain the APKs (i.e. source files) for the
applications you are reinstalling. It only contains an index file
showing all of the apps which were on your phone. During the
installation process, that list is used to reach back to the Google Play
repository and re-download the source files for re-installation. If the
app is not hosted on Google Play, it will not be re-installed
automatically after wiping and re-loading.

To that end:

- If you downloaded the malware as part of an app from a third-party
  website (the most likely scenario), then wiping and re-installing all
  of your apps will clean off the malware. Wiping and re-installing your
  phone will **NOT** reach out to third-party websites to re-install
  apps which were not downloaded from the Google Play Store.
- If the malware was resident in the app *in the Google Play Store*,
  wiping and re-installing will re-install the malware. This is less
  likely, but is still a slight possibility.
- Generally, your app settings (which are saved in your backup) will not
  contain executable code, so it's unlikely that your backup file on the
  Google servers will contain malware.

Of course, if you are rooted and you performed a nandroid backup or if
you used something like Titanium Backup to back up your entire data
partition (including all apps and settings), then restoring that backup
would restore the malware right back on to your phone. This, again, is
only a problem if you are rooted and you used backup software to back up
your phone. A standard (non-root) wipe and re-install from Google will
avoid this problem.
