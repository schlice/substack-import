The answer is \"it depends.\"

Assuming you are on a postpaid (i.e. monthly) contract and you had a
phone which was subsidized by the carrier (i.e. it\'s a US\$600 phone
but you paid US\$99 for it).

The terms of your contract are not changed because you lost your
handset.

If you had device insurance, you can invoke that and (for a small fee)
receive a replacement handset. There are limitations as to how often you
can use your insurance policy; check with the company which provides
your handset insurance for more details.

If you did not have insurance, you can purchase (at full market price) a
replacement handset, new or used.

new or used devices, but not the only options. Shop around for the best
price.

Pro Tip: Most PREPAID mobiles (i.e. the ones you can buy at Walmart)
from the same carrier will also work as POSTPAID devices as well. Buy
the phone from Walmart and then call Customer Service to have the
handset activated and attached to your postpaid account. My kids have
done this in the past when they have damaged their postpaid handsets, or
simply wanted to upgrade technology out of contract cycle. They have
purchased (with their own money) prepaid devices and attached them to
our postpaid account without too much headache.
