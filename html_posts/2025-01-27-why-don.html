Because **God isn't fair.** He never has been. *And you should be
thanking Him for that beautiful truth.*

He doesn't compare people to each other and ensure that their outcomes
are equal. He doesn't say, "Well, since person A was saved, I need to
save everyone in order to make things fair." Or worse, He doesn't say
"Well, person X is going to hell, so I have to send everyone to hell to
make things fair."

**Thank God that He is not fair. Because I don't think you want God to
be fair.**

God is not fair. God is ***just***.

Rather than being fair, God is just, which means that *everyone gets the
exact outcome that they deserve.* So if they love Him and believe Jesus
is their savior and have repented of their sins, they are saved. And if
they reject the truth of His presence all around them and the truth in
their hearts, and they live their lives in defiance of Him, then He
allows them to remain in their sin, and die in their sin, eternally
separated from Him. That is ***just***, not fair.
