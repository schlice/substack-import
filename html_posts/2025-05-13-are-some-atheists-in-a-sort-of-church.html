Sort of, in the same way that atheism is a sort of religion.

Atheists will immediately jump in and say, "No! Atheism isn't a religion
because we don't believe in a god!" This, of course, implies that the
definition of "religion" is "belief in and worship of a god." But there
are plenty of theistic religions which are acknowledged as religions
which also do not believe in a god, such as Taoism, Shintoism, Buddhism,
etc. So that's not really a reason to say that atheism isn't a religion.

Atheism is, therefore, a *non-theistic* religion, similar to
Confucianism in this regard. Atheism, like theism, has many
denominations: anti-theism, Gnosticism, agnosticism, apatheism (which is
more of an attitude than a belief system, but I digress), etc.

But still atheists will blanch at being categorized as a non-theistic
religion, primarily they associate "religion" with "god" and they either
affirmatively reject that a god exists, or they claim to have no belief
that a god exists. So to determine if atheism truly is a non-theistic
religion, we should be able to compare it to theistic religions. In such
a comparison, we should find that it does indeed share characteristics
with theistic religions:

1.  **Do they have saints?** Saints are people who were important
    leaders in their religion that have died but are remembered for
    their contributions. Atheism has these: Christopher Hitchens, Carl
    Sagan, George Carlin (?), etc.
2.  **Do they have preachers?** Preachers are people who stand on the
    stage and deliver a message to those with similar beliefs. Atheism
    has these: Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Matt Dillahunty, etc.
3.  **Do they have core texts?** Core texts (which are sacred or holy in
    theistic religions) are books or literature written by man that
    claims to tell its readers important truths about their beliefs.
    Atheists most definitely have these: *The God Delusion, God is Not
    Great, The End of Faith,* etc*.*
4.  **Do they acknowledge blasphemy?** Blasphemy would be acts or
    statements that are so offensive to their religion that they might
    cause emotion or anger in the listener. To see if blasphemy exists
    in atheism, try this: tell an atheist that God exists, and if the
    atheist is emotional or upset at hearing this, does that not imply
    the atheist feels he is being blasphemed against?
5.  **Do they have apologetics?** The definition of apologetics is
    "debate and argumentation that attempts to defend a religious belief
    against attack." There\'s a reason all the atheists are about to
    swarm the comments section: *to defend their religious beliefs*. If
    they truly believe in nothing (if they truly have a lack of belief
    in god), then there is no reason to defend nothing. Definitionally,
    "nothing" needs no defense, as it doesn't exist. A lack of belief
    does not need to be defended. Me blathering on about nothing
    shouldn't even be noteworthy. It should be nothing worth commenting
    on. So by responding, atheists, you are demonstrating the presence
    of something which is worthy of defense. And that can't be
    "nothing."

So with that understanding, let's answer the question: do they have
churches? Church is traditionally defined as a building (I went to
church), but as was demonstrated during Covid, the church clearly
identified that it is not a building, but a collection of like-minded
people with similar beliefs. Do not atheists have this? American
Atheists? Atheist Alliance International? Freedom From Religion
Foundation? Do not these organizations meet periodically to discuss
insights about their beliefs? Sounds a lot like a non-theistic church to
me.

And let's not forget that atheists can have *degrees of belief* just as
theists can. Not all atheists follow atheism religiously, just as not
all theists follow theism religiously. For example, just as some
Christians might not go to church, listen to pastors, or know the Bible
very well, they can still be somewhat religious, or even not religious
at all, while still believing in the core philosophy of their religion.
In fact, people tell me all the time that they are Christian while
either not acting like a Christian, or *even while holding non-Christian
beliefs.* In precisely the same way, an atheist may not know anything
about important and influential atheist figures, or associate with
atheist organizations, or go out seeking to engage in debate or
apologetics about atheism, and still just hold a quiet and private
belief that God does not exist.

Therefore, based on this comparison, I personally believe atheism is a
non-theistic religion, and atheists do have something akin to a church.

Cue the shrieking atheists in 3...2...1...
