**Content:** [Our department as well does not allow us to receive free
items. We would repay someone who paid for our meal, or we would pay
someone else\'s meal (we would pay for the meal of active duty military
should they be present). We also can\'t accept free items from
convenience stores (i.e. that cup of coffee is on the house).\
\
That said, we can\'t control what we are charged for food/drink; that\'s
your business. We just have to pay something.]{.rendered_qtext}
