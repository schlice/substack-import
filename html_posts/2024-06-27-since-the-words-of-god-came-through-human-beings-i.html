God communicates His Word to us in a variety of ways we call
"revelation."

One type of revelation is that which is clearly seen independent of any
type of scripture. Theologians call this revelation of God *natural* or
*general revelation.* So when I use logical proofs to prove the
existence of God, without ever referencing the Bible, this is an example
of general revelation. God communicates about His nature...through
nature. The natural law indicates the natural law giver. The fact that
we have a conscience (we know right from wrong without ever having been
taught) also is a form of general revelation.

But could God give us *more* information? Sure, nature speaks clearly to
the understanding that a supernatural creator exists. But how could God
reveal Himself so that we could get a more detailed understanding of
what His ultimate purpose is for us?

Couldn't he appear personally to each one of us? He could, but that
might interfere with our free will. C. S. Lewis has some great insights
on this topic. In his *Screwtape Letters*, Screwtape, the senior demon,
writes the following to his disciple Wormwood:

> You must have wondered why the Enemy \[God\] does not make more use of
> His power to be sensibly present to human souls in any degree He
> chooses and at any moment. But you now see that the Irresistible and
> the Indisputable are the two weapons which the very nature of His
> scheme forbids Him to use. Merely to over-ride a human will (as His
> felt presence in any but the faintest and most mitigated degree would
> certainly do) would be for Him useless. He cannot ravish. He can only
> woo.

In other words, God's visible presence would be so overpowering as to
overwhelm our free will and coerce us to believe in Him. Clearly, He has
not chosen the option of face-to-face interactions with every person on
the planet. So perhaps He has chosen a more subtle method of
communication. (In fact, the Bible says God is not always as overt as we
would like him to be \[Isa. 45:15\].) Perhaps God has manifested Himself
in some way to a select group of people over many centuries and inspired
them to write down what they witnessed and heard from Him.

Written language is a precise medium of communication that can easily be
duplicated and passed on to succeeding generations, yet it also can be
easily ignored by those who freely decide that they don't want to be
bothered with God. So a book would work as a valid but not overpowering
means of communication from God.

This is what we call *special revelation*: the revelation of God through
Scripture. Scripture as a means of communicating God's Word fulfills His
requirements of easy, precise duplication, but easy rejection by those
who exercise their free will in order to ignore God.
