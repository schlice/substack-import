*(US answer)*

Individuals can only remain incarcerated for no more than 72 hours
without being charged. That means that the district attorney must charge
the person within 72 hours or they must be released.

If it has been more than 72 hours and the person is still in jail and
formal charges have not been filed, that person's lawyer can go before a
judge and get a *writ of habeas corpus*, which instructs the police to
bring the person in front of a judge so the judge can decide if the
person is being lawfully held in jail.

If the person *has* been charged, it's because the district attorney
believes there is enough evidence that a crime has been committed. Save
your video for trial. Give it to the person's attorney.
