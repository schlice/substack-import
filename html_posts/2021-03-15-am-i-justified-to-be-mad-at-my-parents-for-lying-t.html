**Am I justified to be mad at my parents for lying to me about Santa
when I was being bullied for it?**

There are two parenting topics which need to be addressed, separately.

1.  Belief in Santa
2.  Being bullied

As you can see by my credential, I have raised three boys. None of them
are children any more (but just barely; my youngest is 18). Let's
address these one by one.

1.  I never told my children that Santa does not exist. Ever. I simply
    told them that "Santa only brings presents to those who believe."
    Ever see *The Polar Express?* Can you still hear the bell ring?
    Belief is exactly like that. And if my kids tell me they don't
    believe in Santa (one tried it one year), he did not get a present
    from Santa. He was not okay with that, until he was reminded just
    how vociferously he expressed his disbelief in Santa. Santa only
    brings presents to those who believe. I don't care how old you are.
2.  It is never okay to be bullied, regardless of the reason. And you
    don't blame someone else's bullying behavior on what you choose to
    believe. You are free to believe whatever you wish. Bullies are
    still bullies even if you choose to believe in Santa. The bully is
    the problem, not the parent who shaped your belief.

You are also free to be mad at your parents if you think they are the
reason you are being bullied. You must understand, though, that you are
mistaken and your anger is misplaced. Your parents didn't allow the
bully to proceed with his or her bullying. They didn't even encourage
it. The bullying is never acceptable, whatever the reason.
