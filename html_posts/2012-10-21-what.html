**Content:** [Barbershop singers know the old songs. It\'s what we
learned when we were learning the techniques used to sing barbershop
harmony. Like pianists who learned Chopin, Beethoven, Bach, and the
other classical artists, barbershoppers know the old songs from
practice.\
\
When I hear this question, I can\'t help but be more sentimental and
perhaps a bit more hopeful. Of course, there is more trepidation the
second time around, but love is patient and kind, and love never seeks
to injure. I can\'t help but think of the lyrics to the old song,
\"Takin\' A Chance On Love\" which happens to be all about love the
second time around, and the artist relates this to a game of cards. If
you\'ll allow me, I\'d like to give you those lyrics:\

> I thought love\'s game was over,\
> Lady Luck had gone away.\
> I laid my cards on the table,\
> Unable to play.\
> Then I heard Good Fortune say,\
> They\'re dealing you a new hand today!\
> \
> So here I go again\
> I hear the trumpets blow again\
> I\'m all aglow again\
> Takin\' a chance on love\
> \
> Here I slide again,\
> About to take that ride again\
> So starry-eyed again,\
> Takin\' a chance on love.\
> \
> I thought the cards were a frame-up\
> I never would try.\
> But now I\'m takin\' the game up,\
> And the Ace of Hearts is high!\
> \
> Things are mending now,\
> I see a rainbow blending now,\
> We\'ll have a happy ending now,\
> Takin\' a chance on love\
> \
> I\'m walkin\' around with a horseshoe,\
> In clover I lie.\
> And brother Rabbit, of course you\
> Better kiss your foot goodbye\
> \
> On the ball again,\
> I\'m headin\' for a fall again,\
> I\'m gonna give my all again,\
> Takin\' a chance on love!\

I think many nth-time relationships fail because of our own unease and
fear of \"being hurt\" again. But if you follow the advice of the
author, \"take the chance.\" They\'re dealing you a new hand!
