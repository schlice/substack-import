**If a boyfriend who is 18 and his girlfriend gives birth at 15, and the
baby is his, will he get arrested and charged with rape, or a similar
crime even though it\'s what they wanted?**

The answer, of course, is "it depends."

First of all, simply the act of having a baby in a hospital does not
trigger legal action. The hospital is a hospital, not a police station.
Health care workers usually only have mandatory reporting requirements
when they suspect abuse or a dangerous situation. For example, hospitals
do not generally call the police when an underage person comes in
presenting with acute alcohol poisoning (i.e. they drank too much).
However, if while treating the patient, they see signs and symptoms
which are common in abuse, they may be obligated to report to police. In
most cases, hospitals have to report sexual abuse.

Statutory rape laws sometimes include "close in age" laws. These laws
would state something like statutory rape only applies when the
participants are more than four years apart. These are also called
"Romeo and Juliet" laws. They are designed to prevent older people from
taking advantage of younger people.

Finally, in many states, a 16 year old can be legally married with her
parents' permission and a judge's order. This could obviate the
statutory rape charge. In a few states, a statutory rape charge can be
alleviated through marriage, though those laws are currently under
review.

Check with your local laws about statutory rape and close-in-age laws.
