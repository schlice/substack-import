**Considering the global damage that Trump is doing because he has way
too much power, should the US (#21 for democracy) go to a more
democratic system like other western countries?**

I think you're going to have to clarify the damage that Trump is doing
to the world. You're also going to have to clarify what "more
democratic" means.

But you're right. The President has way too much power. However, that's
not a reason to pitch the Constitution.

The problem is not that the Constitution gives the President too much
power. If the President has too much power, the reason is that
**Congress** gave the President too much power.
