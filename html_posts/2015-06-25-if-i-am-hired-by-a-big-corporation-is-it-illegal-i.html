**Content:** [It\'s not illegal, but many companies make you sign a
\"non-compete\" clause when you join them, which requires that if you
want to hire on with certain companies (which are direct competitors of
big corporation), you will have to wait a certain amount of time,
generally six months to one year, before you can join the new firm.
Check with the HR department at big corporation to see if you signed one
of these when joining, and what companies it applies to.\
\
If you have access to certain IP (intellectual property) at big
corporation, you may have had to sign additional contracts when gaining
access to that property which may limit your ability to move to new
companies. As [[Dan

said, slavery was abolished in the US, but companies are allowed to
protect their intellectual property.]{.rendered_qtext}
