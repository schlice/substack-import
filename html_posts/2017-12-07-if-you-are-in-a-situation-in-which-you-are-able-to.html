**If you are in a situation in which you are able to divert a train that
is about to hit 5 people so that it hits one person, what is the legally
right thing to do?**

*(This answer is specific to the US. Other countries may have different
laws which would change the nature of this answer)*

Since you asked about the **legal** answer, then the answer is, as
everyone has said, to do nothing. Legally, you are only implicated if
you **act**. There is no law which *requires* you to intervene to save a
life in this situation, unless you are in certain specific government or
medical professions (and if you are, you know you are). Therefore, as an
unaffiliated civilian, you are legally correct if you **do nothing.**

So you can either be legally responsible for the death of one person, or
not legally responsible for the deaths of five people.
