did a great job explaining the enlisted side. I'll explain the officer
side.

Enlisteds enlist for a set period of time. At the conclusion of each
enlistment, hey can "re-enlist" for more set periods of time. There's no
formal re-enlistment ceremony, but enlisteds need an officer to sign the
form that approves their decision to re-enlist. Many of my troops would
do a small ceremony with me, which I gladly did for them. We'd find an
American flag and stand in front of it, and we used a form of the
commissioning oath which officers take when they accept their
commission. It's actually an old enlisted swearing-in ceremony, which is
mostly unused today, but we did it when they wanted to do a ceremony for
re-enlistment:

*I, \<state your name\>, do solemnly swear that I will support and
defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies,
foreign or domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the
same, that I will obey the orders of the President of the United States,
and the orders of those appointed over me, according to regulation and
the Uniform Code of Military Justice, so help me God.*

Then I'd sign the form and the enlisted member would be good for another
few years.

Officers, on the other hand, are "commissioned" and that commission is
not bound by time. Your single commission as a military officer will
last you your entire service.

Most officers will have anywhere from a three to five year ADSC upon
commissioning. As [[Tim
Dees](https://www.quora.com/profile/Tim-Dees)]{.qlink_container}
mentioned, Academy graduates have a five year ADSC following graduation.
USAFA grads who were not pilots also had 5 year ADSCs. "Five and dive"
was the colloquialism for non-pilots. They are not required to leave,
but once your Active Duty Service Commitment is fulfilled, you can leave
at any time. That said, if there was some schooling you took to get into
the military which was partially paid for by the government, or if you
earn a degree using government tuition assistance, you repay this money
using time in service. This will be tacked on to your "Active Duty
Service Commitment" or the amount of time you are required to remain on
active duty. When I got my master's degree, I had two years added to my
ADSC. Thankfully, that commitment ran *concurrently* with any other
commitments I had, and I still had a 5 year commitment from the Academy.
Pilots, on the other hand, have a much higher ADSC than non-pilots. When
I was active, a pilot picked up a nine year ADSC following the
completion of Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT), and generally seven of
those years were required to be "in the cockpit," flying jobs. I don't
know if this is still the case today.

The most common time for an officer to leave the military is when an
assignment is received. When an officer is assigned to a new duty
station, he has seven days to accept the assignment. If he has no ADSC,
he can turn down the assignment and begin out-processing instead. This
is called the "7-day option" or "7 day opt" for short. So if you hear
that a military officer did a 7-day opt, that's what it means.
Sometimes, they change that phrase to "7-day out", but you know now that
it's really 7-day opt. This is how I left Active Duty, but instead of
out-processing from the military, I simply transferred my commission
into the Air Force Reserve, and out-processed from my then-current duty
station. It was an easy process, and it is entirely permissible to
transfer an Active Duty commission into the Reserve component once the
ADSC is fulfilled. It helped that I already had a job offer from a
civilian company at the time.
