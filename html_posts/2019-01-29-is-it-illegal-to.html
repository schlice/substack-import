**Is it illegal to "boobytrap" your property (as shown in the link)?**

Yes, it is.

The problem is that booby traps are *indiscriminate*. They will hurt a
thief just as badly as they will hurt an innocent child who was playing
nearby.

A booby trap cannot determine *intent*. What if I had to move that
cooler to get to someone who was injured? I wasn't trying to steal your
cooler, but now you've injured me, and now you'll be responsible for any
medical costs I incur due to your trap.

Additionally, you can't injure someone to protect *property*. You can
use force to defend against force, but this is not that situation.

A better option would have been to use something that is non-injurious.
A pepper spray bomb/fart spray bomb/glitter bomb is a great way to catch
porch pirates, as you can see in [[this

This device produces non-lethal (but highly annoying) results.
