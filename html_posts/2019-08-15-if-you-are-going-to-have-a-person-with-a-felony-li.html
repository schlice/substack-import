**If you are going to have a person with a felony living with you after
they are released from prison, what things can you do to support their
transition into a law-abiding life?**

If they are prohibited from accessing certain items (i.e. firearms,
alcohol, some prescription drugs, etc), remove those from the home while
the felon lives with you. Not that any one particular felon will use
those things, but if you want to support their transition, give them the
best opportunity to succeed by getting those things out of the home.

Encourage the felon to be on time, hold down a job, keep a neat room,
keep a neat appearance. These things may be small, but they may have
been de-emphasized while in prison. Normal everyday life requires these
things. They were emphasized when we were children; we have to
re-emphasize them now while the felon transitions back to normal life.

The felon must keep their appointments with their parole officer (PO) if
they have one (most do). And even if the felon was told that the
appointments are stupid, a waste of time, you don't have to do them,
etc, encourage them to do it anyway.

Most importantly, while the felon is a felon, that person is not defined
by his/her felony. They are still a person, who happens to be a felon.
But they're a person first. Always remember that first and foremost.
