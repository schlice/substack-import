If a case came before the Court that posited a valid argument that *DC
v. Heller* was incorrectly decided because the basis for its decision
was unconstitutional, I would ***expect*** that it would be overturned.
But that's unlikely, as we'll see here shortly.

The problem, as I see it, is that **you expect bad rulings to stand,**
***because you like the outcome.*** You may not have liked the outcome
of *Heller,* but it will stand because it is a Constitutional ruling.

You probably wanted *Roe v. Wade* to stand, because you liked the
outcome. But the problem with *Roe* was that it was a bad decision
because it was unconstitutional. The foundation upon which *Roe* was
built was not Constitutionally based. A right was found which, in
actuality, does not exist in the Constitution. You can't "make up" a
right that doesn't exist, and then use that as the foundation for a
decision. A house built on sand will wash away.

Not so with *DC v. Heller.* The foundations upon which that case were
built are strong Constitutional ones. The reasons why the case was
decided in the way that it was are clear, and are all found in the
Constitution. The Court in *Heller* did not "make up" any rights and
then build their decision on them. They used solid historical analysis
to show that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to own
firearms, unconnected with service in a militia. This interpretation was
not *radical* or unsurprising, as it matches similar arms-bearing rights
decided by the states, both before and after the passage of the
Amendment. In order to overturn *Heller*, the Court would have to
contravene many State Constitutions which also protect the right of an
individual to keep and bear arms. Therefore, *Heller* is Constitutional.
*Stare decisis* would say that because the decision was, in fact,
Constitutional, it should stand. A house built on solid rock will
withstand the storm.
