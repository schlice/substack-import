**Honestly speaking, for students at the US military academies (West
Point, USNA, USAFA, USCGA) how much do your academy grades truly matter
for your military career (as long as you pass)? Does having top grades
increase your chances to make flag rank?**

Your grades do not matter for your military career. Having top grades
did not increase your chances to become a general officer.

Some useful catch-phrases we used to have:

- 2.0 and go! (Pronounced "two-oh and go") Meaning: if you were pilot
  qualified, all you had to do was pass and you'd go to pilot training.
- What do you call the last graduate in the Order of Merit? Lieutenant.
  Meaning: just like you call the first graduate in the Order of Merit.

We also used to say that you were "maxin' the min" if you did the
minimum required to "fill the squares" and pass.

Now, all of that said, grades can be an indicator of someone with solid
career potential. If someone has the ability to achieve academically at
the Academy, there's a good chance that they will be able to do
everything needed in order to achieve during their career as well.

So while high grades are *usually* an indication of someone who has high
potential (HiPo), high grades are not **required** in order to be HiPo.
Remember, Patton struggled academically during his first year at West
Point and had to repeat it after failing math. He got a tutor and
eventually graduated 46th out of 103 cadets in his class.
