**Content:** [You are the ***sum total*** of your experiences, good and
bad.\
\
There are plenty of things I am ashamed of, things that I regret, and
things that I wish were not a part of my story. But they are. For better
or worse, they are all part of my story.\
\
But they make up who I am. Good and bad, all of my experiences make up
who I am.\
\
Owning your shame is key. As [[Bren√©
Brown](https://www.quora.com/topic/Bren%C3%A9-Brown)]{.qlink_container}
says, shame demons can\'t survive in the light. So own your story. Own
your shame. Understand that it is your foundation, and embrace it.\
\
And try not to repeat the things you are ashamed of.]{.rendered_qtext}
