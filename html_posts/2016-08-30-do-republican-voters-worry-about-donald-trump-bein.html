If Hillary voters don't worry that she is the biggest threat to national
security since Nixon, runs her foundation like the Mafia, has failed at
every political office she has been offered, and sells political
influence like it's going out of style, then I have little doubt that
Trump voters would care if he's actually a child rapist, or guilty of
committing incest as you suggest. He's not going to legalize rape as the
president, nor is he going to rape *your* child, so there's little
danger in keeping him trapped under mountains of paperwork in the Oval
Office.

If you need more convincing regarding ***why*** people don't care about
the true character of political candidates, please refer to [[Sierra

how bad you think Trump is and how the world will fall into nuclear
winter within six months of his taking office. If your comments are not
constructive, I will summarily delete them. My answer, my comments.
