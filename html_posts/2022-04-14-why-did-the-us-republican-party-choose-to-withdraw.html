You can find no better answer than from the Chairwoman of the GOP, Ronna
McDaniel:

> Debates are an important part of the democratic process, and the RNC
> is committed to free and fair debates. The Commission on Presidential
> Debates is biased and has refused to enact simple and commonsense
> reforms to help ensure fair debates including hosting debates before
> voting begins and selecting moderators who have never worked for
> candidates on the debate stage.
