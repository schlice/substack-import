**Can I be prosecuted by Starbucks for taking extra sugar-in-the-raw
packets and napkins for home use?**

You *could*, but it's highly unlikely that you would.

Let's be honest with ourselves, shall we? If you're taking more
condiments then you can reasonably use in your current visit to a
restaurant, that's **theft**. There's no equivocating, there's no
excuses, it's theft.

But we lie to ourselves, don't we? I know what you're thinking, it's
only condiments, right? They cost next to nothing, and if the restaurant
didn't want us to take them, they wouldn't put them out, right?

Except those are just the lies we tell ourselves to justify our theft.

While each individual sugar packet is cheap, they're not free. And
custom sugar like sugar-in-the-raw is more expensive per packet than
regular white table sugar (where white sugar might be less than a penny
a packet (\$0.006/packet at last calculation), sugar-in-the-raw will run
about \$0.02/packet). Again, while this doesn't seem like much, it's
still 1% of your \$2 coffee. What if someone told you they were going to
take 1% of your pay? Yes, it's only a little bit, but you'd still be
upset. And considering that when you steal extra packets, the additional
cost is passed on to customers, or usually taken out of employee's pay.
And you can guess which employees will see their pay reduced because of
increased overhead. Certainly not the managers or the executives.

Restaurants expect people to use as many condiments as they like, but
just for that visit. The condiments are there for you to use during that
visit only, not to use during that visit *and* re-stock your sugar bowl
at home. Will they prosecute you? Probably not. The worst that would
likely happen to you is, assuming you're caught, the store would ask you
to leave and not come back. Continued violation of that particular rule
(coming back when you were asked not to) would be treated as trespassing
and the police would be contacted.
