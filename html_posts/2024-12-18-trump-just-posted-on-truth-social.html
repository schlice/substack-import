Despite the fact that I am indeed happy that Republicans have full
control of the government this time around, I'm not sure where he got
the idea that he won the biggest mandate in 129 years. I'd love to see
his calculations on that.

Yes, Republicans have won control of all branches of government, but
Trump's Presidential election success certainly isn't the biggest in 129
years. It's big, but not even as big as Reagan's win in 1980. Nixon won
with 61% of the popular vote; Trump's win, while decisive, didn't break
50%.

Democrats, of course, are now claiming that [[Trump can hardly claim a
mandate](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=30dd86&url=https://www.npr.org/2024/12/16/g-s1-38003/trump-mandate-presidents){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"

of the popular vote. Fine, Democrats. If 50% of the popular vote is the
minimum required to claim a mandate, we'll be certain to remember that
the next time a Democrat is elected to the White House. Bookmark this
NPR article because it will become very important when that happens.

And as far as ignorance is concerned, I don't think Trump has the
ability to be ignorant. He has way too many advisers telling him stuff
to be ignorant. He may handle it in ways you don't expect, but ignorance
is probably not the best descriptor for Trump.
