Child support is not about punishing the higher-earning parent, or the
non-custodial parent. Child support isn't about rewarding or enriching
the custodial parent, or the lower-earning parent.

In fact, child support isn't about the parents at all. And it's
definitely not paid to "support the girl."

**Child support is about the child.**

Child support payments are determined by the state using a formula which
takes several factors into consideration, only one of which is the
non-custodial parent's ability to pay. It also takes into account the
mother's ability to work. Does she have a degree? Does she have a
high-paying job? Can she afford to raise a child? This wouldn't *negate*
the child support requirement (Person A still has to contribute), but it
might *lessen* it.

Child support does not increase simply because the non-custodial parent
has more money. So at the point at which Person A becomes a billionaire,
the woman cannot haul him back to court and demand he pay more in child
support just because he *can*.

Most importantly, child support has nothing to do with "supporting the
girl." If they were not married, he has no obligation to support her. He
*might* if he's a nice guy and suddenly has billions to spend, but he is
not *obligated* to. It is truly "his billions, his choice." Perhaps if
they had been married and they got divorced, she could ask the court to
take another look at *alimony* (called *maintenance* in some states),
but *child support* is a fixed amount to ensure that the basic needs for
a child are met until that child turns 18.

Person A gets a woman pregnant at 18 and has to pay one thousand in
child support. He leaves the girl and the baby but still pays child
support. A becomes a billionaire and famous. Should he support the girl?
His billions his choice right?
