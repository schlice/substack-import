**What\'s your opinion on the news that judge ruled in favour of CNN in
initial proceeding and White House must restore Jim Acosta press pass
immediately?**

First of all, it's a temporary restraining order. There is no ruling.

Second, it's an order on *5th Amendment* grounds, not 1st Amendment. The
order states that Acosta was not granted his due process rights under
the 5th Amendment when his hard pass was revoked, so he can
*temporarily* have it back until the case is heard.

Finally, I think that much is correct. If you have a 5th Amendment right
to due process before the White House revokes your press pass, then he
should have it back until he has due process to argue his case.

Hopefully they just don't call on him during the briefings. I'm pretty
sure there's no Constitutional amendment that requires you to be called
on in a press briefing.
