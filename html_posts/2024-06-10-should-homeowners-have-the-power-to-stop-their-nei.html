No. **In general**, homeowners should not be able to stop other
homeowners from building new homes.

The calculus changes when the homes are all within an area controlled by
an HOA.

In that case, it is the Governing Documents which control whether or not
a homeowner can build a new home. Approval for the home is up to the
Architectural Review Committee (a committee under the HOA), and if they
do not approve it because its design or colors or layout does not
comport with the rest of the community, then this level of control is
acceptable.

Beyond the example of being within an HOA, if you are a homeowner, you
get to do whatever is allowed by your local government's zoning rules.
So there's always someone who will control what you do on your property.
Unless you have an HOA though, that won't be your neighbors.
