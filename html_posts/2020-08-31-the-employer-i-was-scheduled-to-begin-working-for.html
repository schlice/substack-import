**The employer I was scheduled to begin working for req\'d online
training prior to starting. The training itself said we were to be paid
0.5 hours for it. They are refusing to pay claiming training is part of
onboarding and thus no pay. Is this legal?**

As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."

Since you are discussing being paid in hours, I will assume you are an
hourly employee (these days, called "non-exempt" employees). I will also
assume you are in the United States.

If this is true, your employer is mistaken.

If you work, you get paid. Hourly employees must be paid for everything
they do, including training. There is no "pre-work" and there is no
"post-work" and there is no "onboarding" and there is no "offboarding"
for which you are not paid. If you are working, you are paid.

According to the Departmet of Labor, attendance at lectures, meetings,
training programs and similar activities do not need to be counted as
working time only if all four of the following criteria are met:

- Attendance is outside normal hours.
- Attendance is voluntary.
- The event is not job-related.
- No other work is concurrently performed.

If you are required to attend (as in your case), you are working, and
you must be paid.
