**Does is matter to conservatives that Brett Kavanaugh told many
provable lies to the Senate Judiciary Committee?**

It doesn't matter whether Conservatives care about lies Kavanaugh may
have told. Or even if you can prove that it's untrue.

It only matters to Congress.

In the case of lying to Congress, there are two separate crimes we can
discuss: "knowingly and willfully giving materially false statements to
Congress" which does not need to be done under oath, and a general
"perjury (lying under oath)" charge.

In either case, while you may be able to prove that "an untruth was
spoken," the actual crime of lying to Congress is really difficult to
prove. First, you have to prove that the lie was "knowingly and
willfully" given. This means that the alleged liar knew the right
answer, and intentionally gave a false answer with the intent to derail
an investigation or to mislead the Congress. That intent statement kinda
ruins most of the "lying" accusations, because most of the things
Kavanaugh has, of late, been accused of lying about have not been done
with the intent of misleading Congress, they're just factually
incorrect. Then, on top of that, the "materiality" portion of the law
kicks in. The statement has to be materially important to why Congress
has you testifying in the first place; it can't just be an untruth which
was "accidentally" given, or was a "mistake" in fact, in any ancillary
statement throughout the testimony. It actually has to be part of what
Congress was primarily investigating with the testimony.
