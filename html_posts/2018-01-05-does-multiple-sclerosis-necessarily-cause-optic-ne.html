**Does multiple sclerosis necessarily cause optic neuritis?**

Short answer is no.

Optic neuritis is one possible symptom of MS, among many. Not everyone
who gets MS will also get optic neuritis, but it is a very common first
symptom.

And even so, the question also could imply that optic neuritis is always
caused by MS, and this is also not true. It's only true in about half of
the cases of optic neuritis that the cause is MS.
