I was seated in the squad room of a detective's squad in a precinct and
department which shall remain nameless to protect the reputation of the
department. My dad was a squad detective in this precinct, which is why
I was there. I spent a lot of time there as a kid. They had a drunk in
the holding room. He was sleeping off a terrible bender, handcuffed to
the bench in the room. The room didn't have one of those massive picture
windows with the two-way mirrors. It instead had a small teller-style
window, also two-way, but you could slide it sideways to open it. It was
almost drive-thru window size.

Anyway, the detectives decided to mess with the drunk. One detective got
a coffee mug from the break room and urinated into it in the hallway
next to the holding room. He then quietly opened the window, reached his
arm in up to his shoulder while holding the mug, and proceeded to throw
the entire mug of urine onto the drunk. The drunk awoke violently and
flailed at the end of his tether, until he finally got his senses about
him and probably thought that he had pissed himself. After a minute or
two, he was asleep again.

The squad had a great laugh over this. I was in high school and was
still na√Øve to many of the ways of the world, so I was quietly in shock.

Is messing with drunks dehumanizing? To the drunk, probably not. He
likely didn't remember a thing. To the detectives? I think that in order
to throw a mug of urine onto a person, you have to believe you are
somehow better than them, even if not at a conscious level.
