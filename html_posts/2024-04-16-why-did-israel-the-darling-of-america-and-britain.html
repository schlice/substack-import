title: "Why did Israel, the darling of America and Britain, who has been in attacking mode in Gaza for the past 6 months, switch to defensive mode with just one attack from Iran? Does it have any friends left in the Gulf besides Jordan?"

**No one wants World War III.**

And if Iran and Israel go to war, there is no doubt that a global
conflict will ensue, with Arab countries on one side, and Israel, the
US, NATO allies and friends on the other.

Israel has been dealing with Hamas terror attacks since they withdrew
from Gaza. Swatting rockets out of the skies and dealing with suicide
bombers can be pretty draining for a country to deal with.

But for Iran to ***directly*** involve itself in the conflict, rather
than through proxies as it has been (i.e. Hezbollah and the Houthis), is
a clear *escalation.*

Escalations, when they have global implications, are never a good thing.

Conflict with the Palestinians is one thing. Global war between Iran and
Israel is a completely separate thing.
