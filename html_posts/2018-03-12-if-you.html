**If you're charged with a crime, is it always better to plead guilty
even if you are actually innocent?**

*Why would you voluntarily go to jail when you didn't do it?*

First of all, if you're charged with a crime, get a lawyer.

Then, depending on your case, do what your lawyer tells you to do.

The only time you would be pleading guilty is if you are involved in a
plea bargain (i.e. you agree to plead guilty in order to receive an
agreed-upon lighter sentence so that you can avoid a trial).

But on its own, pleading guilty to a crime comes with a whole host of
ramifications which follow that pleading. You will be labeled a "felon,"
and many of your Constitutional rights will be stripped from you. It
will become nearly impossible to get a good job, or to do simple things
like apply for a loan. Want to rent an apartment, or financing for a
car? Good luck. Filling out any official document becomes quite
difficult. Second, simply pleading guilty when you are not guilty is a
perversion of the justice system, and doesn't serve anyone's best
interest: the state, the accuser, nor the defendant.

Some people may do this anyway because they're "covering" for someone
else --- a family member, a child, etc. They choose to "take the
punishment" for someone else, so they claim they did it. When a
prosecutor gets an unsolicited, unexpected guilty plea, he's always
suspicious of these alternate reasons for such a plea. That's noble, but
it doesn't help anyone get to the bottom of the case. Yes, someone goes
to jail, but a) it's not the right person, and b) we never find out the
real reason for the crime. There are things which can be done if the
offender is a minor, or if there are extenuating circumstances.

Ideally, we want the *right* person to go to jail, not just *a* person.
