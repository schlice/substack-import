**Should Trump voters lose the right to vote for displaying gross
incompetence as citizens and irresponsibility in electing a fraud,
idiot, and Russian agent?**

The remedies for being "a fraud, idiot, and Russian agent" are not to
remove the right to vote from citizens.

If Trump is a fraud and an idiot, the Constitutional remedy is to not
re-elect him.

If Trump is a Russian agent, the Constitutional remedy is to impeach
him.

But he was a legal, valid choice on the ballot, and voters who voted for
him did so legally.

Voters have been incompetent for all time. This is why, originally,
there were minimum requirements needed to be a voter. You had to be a
*landowner* before you could vote. This meant you had some modicum of
intelligence and could exercise critical thinking skills.

But this particular bar on voting rights was rightly removed, because
equality. All citizens, by the very nature of their citizenship, have
the right to vote. It's not a privilege insofar as privilege vs right,
and only a privilege can be revoked.

So no, you can't lose your right to vote for voting for someone who was
a valid candidate at the time he was elected. This makes simply no
sense.

You calling voters incompetent means nothing, because there is no
competency test before you can vote.
