**Will the developers of a commercial game be in trouble if an artist
suddenly changes the license of the music used in the game from
something like CC-BY to a non-commercial license when the game has
already been released?**

CC licenses are non-revocable. Once a content creator publishes content
under CC, licensees can use that content based on the terms of that
agreement for the duration of that license.

You can certainly stop distributing **new** content under the CC license
at any time, but once you publish content using the CC license, you
cannot retroactively go back and re-license that existing content, or
change the terms of the license agreement on content already released
under CC. Anyone who has a copy of that CC-licensed content can continue
to use it based on the terms of that license.

As a content creator, therefore, you should think carefully before
distributing your content under CC.[\[1\]](#TCUCK){#cite-TCUCK
