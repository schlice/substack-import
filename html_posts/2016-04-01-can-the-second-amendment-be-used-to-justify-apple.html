Regardless of the parallels you may draw between the *reason* behind the
Second Amendment and any data privacy issues, you cannot use the Second
Amendment to justify data encryption unless you can prove that data
encryption can be classified as \"arms.\"

Arms, in the Second Amendment\'s vernacular, refer to mechanical devices
which cause a projectile to be fired at a very high velocity for the
purpose of killing (by the way all you Quoran sticklers, if you want to
debate the purpose of a gun, ask me a separate question; I\'m not going
to get into it here, nor will I answer any comments about it; it is
unrelated to this question).

\"Data encryption\" is the act of using a \"cipher\" and a \"key\" to
make data unreadable but when \"decrypted\" using the \"key\" the data
once again becomes readable.

As you can see, \"data encryption\" is not \"arms.\"

So in the strictest sense, you cannot use the Second Amendment to
justify data encryption. The Second Amendment is strictly limited in
scope to \"arms,\" and the keeping and bearing thereof.

Data encryption is more closely related to the \"right to privacy\"
which has been interpreted to exist in the Constitution than the Second
Amendment. You can therefore use the Constitutional \"right to privacy\"
to justify data encryption much more readily than you can use the Second
Amendment.
