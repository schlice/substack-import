I was a little sleepy when I wrote my original answer, but in thinking
about it, I think I have a better understanding. I was thinking of clubs
that are membership-based but **open to the general public.**

If you have a club that is ***truly*** private (i.e. not open to the
general public, facilities open to members only, true selectivity in the
membership process, etc), you are not subject to Title III of the ADA.

It's interesting though, your requirements under Title III would be to
make your club accessible to everyone; however, the people you are
excluding do not need accommodations. So even if you do open your club
temporarily to the general public (like to do a fundraiser), there
wouldn't be anything special you would need to do to bring your club
into Title III compliance. Your club would already be *de facto* Title
III compliant.

**TL;DR: Private membership clubs do not have to comply with the ADA as
they are not "places of public
accommodation."**[\[1\]](#ihEcN){#cite-ihEcN .citation_link}
