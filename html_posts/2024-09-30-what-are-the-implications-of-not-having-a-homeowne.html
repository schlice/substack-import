You could end up with "that neighbor."

You know the one. He has seven cars in front of his house, and only two
of them have wheels. He painted his house electric blue because he likes
blue, even though it totally looks out of place with the rest of the
houses in the neighborhood. And while I'm certain that the stuff he's
cooking is delicious to him, the smell is just God-awful.

In most cases, what he's doing is not illegal, so no one from the city
or county will help you address it.

But now, try to sell your house.

What's going to happen? *Fewer* people will want to buy your house
(especially for the price you're asking) because you live next door to
one of "those neighbors." So you'll have to reduce the price of your
house to get someone to buy it.

Congratulations, your "neighbor" just reduced the value of your house.

And for an investment which is usually the largest single investment any
American typically makes, no one wants the stupidity of their neighbors
to cost them money.

The HOA can address these issues quickly.

So the HOA doesn't preserve the value of your home by controlling what
you do. The HOA preserves the value of your home by controlling what
your *neighbors* do.
