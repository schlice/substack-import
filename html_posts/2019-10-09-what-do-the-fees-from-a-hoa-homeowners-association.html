The last HOA I ran had far fewer amenities. We didn't have a park, a
pool, or a playground. But we still had plenty of fees to cover:

- Water for the common areas, and landscaping for the same. This was our
  biggest expense; water in Colorado Springs is not cheap.
- Snow removal on the walking paths and common area sidewalks
- We contract for neighborhood trash service; it saves money and adds
  convenience for homeowners.
- General liability insurance on the common areas
- Administrative fees paid to our managing agent (the lowest expense we
  had).
- Legal fees paid to our attorney.

And that's about it. We have money available for common area wall
repair, fence repair, and other maintenance and upkeep. And maybe an end
of summer barbecue in one of the cul-de-sacs.
