It was gun control in urban areas that allowed the Orlando night club
shooter to commit a mass murder instead of just killing a few people.

The gun control tactic known as **gun-free zones** created a free-fire
zone for the killer to indiscriminately kill as many people as he wanted
without fear of being shot, because all the good law abiding citizens
were not carrying their concealed firearms in the gun-free zone.

Urbanization does not imply safety. In fact, urbanization and the
increase in socioeconomic boundary zones actually increases the
incentive for crime. Guns are **more** indicated in these zones, not
**less.**
