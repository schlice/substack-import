The A-10 Thunderbolt II (a.k.a. the Warthog) was literally built to be a
flying platform for the General Electric GAU/8 Gatling gun, which can
quite literally shred a tank. In fact, the cannon can only be fired for
a few seconds at a time, the rearward force so significant it can cause
the aircraft to stall at slow speeds. Interestingly, the reason I
include it here, is because during the initial rollout of the aircraft,
General Electric did not have the GAU/8 ready, so the first prototypes
were fitted with the Vulcan 20mm cannon.\

The image above shows the aircraft firing its General Electric GAU/8
cannon. The 30mm rounds fire at 50 rounds per second (RPS) for the first
second, and then fire at 70 RPS for the second. The energy of the
projectiles is about seven times that of the Vulcan which is fitted to
most aircraft. The seven-barreled gun is 20 feet long and weighs 2.5
tons, and the drum can hold about 1100 rounds, enough to destroy 10
tanks.\

The exhaust from the cannon is also so significant, that in early
prototypes of the A-10, the engines would stall from lack of oxygen as
the gun\'s tremendous exhaust was taken up by the engines and literally
stalled them. That was one of the reasons the engines were mounted above
the aircraft center line.\
\
The pilot sits in a titanium \"bathtub\" as this is a Close Air Support
(CAS) aircraft supporting ground troops, and the pilot needs protection
from small arms fire. The aircraft is highly maneuverable, and does its
best work near the ground, destroying enemy ground installations and
armor.
