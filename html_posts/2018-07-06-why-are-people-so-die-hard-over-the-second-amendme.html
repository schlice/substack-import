**Why are people so die hard over the second amendment? We don't stand a
chance against the government by simply having the right to own
firearms! Maybe if the ball and musket was still around things would be
even.**

1.  Read up on [[asymmetric
    warfare](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3c3bcc&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_warfare){.external_link
    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
    qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}. Tell the goat
    herders in Afghanistan that they don't stand a chance against the US
    military, while they're systematically killing our troops with
    nothing more than old unexploded ordnance and a burner cell phone.
2.  We may not *win* against the US military...wait, I need to re-think
    this. We have somewhere north of **100 million** gun owners in the
    United States. Our military [[stands
    at](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=84ccf5&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces%23Personnel){.external_link
    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
    qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} approximately 1.3
    million, with another 800,000 in reserves, bringing the total to
    just about 2 million. Therefore, as a fighting force, we outnumber
    the US military 50 to 1. And there's a good chance that a majority
    of those military members will never turn their backs on the
    Constitution and will never turn their guns on US citizens.
3.  If you're reading bullet 2 and thinking, "Yeah, but the US military
    is the best in the world, and we're just a bunch of rank amateurs,"
    you should read up on another war where a bunch of rank amateurs
    defeated the best military in the world. The Revolutionary War. We
    did it once...
4.  But even if we didn't "win," that win would be **very costly** for
    the US military, in terms of dollars and lives, rivaling the last
    Civil War. There won't be much of a country to lord over once this
    war is done.
