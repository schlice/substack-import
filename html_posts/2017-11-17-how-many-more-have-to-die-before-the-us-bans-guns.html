The answer is:

***There are no solutions. There are only trade-offs.***

And the undeniable truth, the truth which must be accepted, is that
there are always outliers. People will always die from some cause. We
need to do the trade-off math and determine if the benefit is worth the
deaths.

In the United States, the top 15 causes of death in 2014 were:

1\. Diseases of heart (heart disease)\
2. Malignant neoplasms (cancer)\
3. Chronic lower respiratory diseases\
4. Accidents (unintentional injuries)\
5. Cerebrovascular diseases (stroke)\
6. Alzheimer's disease\
7. Diabetes mellitus (diabetes)\
8. Influenza and pneumonia\
9. Nephritis, nephrotic syndrome and nephrosis (kidney disease)\
10. Intentional self-harm (suicide)\
11. Septicemia\
12. Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis\
13. Essential hypertension and hypertensive renal disease
(hypertension)\
14. Parkinson's disease\
15. Pneumonitis due to solids and liquids[\[1\]](#dZMKW){#cite-dZMKW

The benefit of cars is obviously so great, that we don't mind that
accidents rank #4 on this list. It's a trade-off. So far, the math shows
us that the benefit of retaining ownership of guns is worth the
classroom full of dead kids in Sandy Hook, CT. And if ***that*** didn't
get rid of guns, I don't think any one incident will do it.

Murder, with or without a gun, doesn't even make the top 15. Some of the
#4 accidents and about half of the #10 intentional self-harm involved a
gun. So you might be able to scratch the surface of accidents and push
suicidal people to other methods, but you won't contribute to stopping
any of these in a meaningful way.

It's probably also telling that none of these causes of death focus on
the tool used. We're not even collecting statistics about it without
having to look specifically into each one of these causes of death.

Why, then, are we struggling so hard to control guns when there are ALL
OF THESE CAUSES OF DEATH that we could spend our energy focusing on
instead of focusing on the ONLY ONE WE CAN'T REGULATE AWAY? Our
Constitution ensures that guns are here to stay. So why do we waste the
time?
