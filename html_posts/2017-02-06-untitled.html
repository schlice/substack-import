I seriously cannot remember where that statistic came from, but in
looking at state statistics, I've universally found that more knives are
used than guns. Here's one study that was done in California, which
shows that knives were only used marginally more than guns.

But there aren't any universal statistics that I can find. The FBI stats
only show by type of crime, not whether or not they were DV-related.
