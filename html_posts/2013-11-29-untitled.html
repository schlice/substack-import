**Content:** [So as long as a faction does not have any tie to any
particular country, or sponsored by any particular country, they can
attack a nation haphazardly without any worry of repercussion because
that nation cannot retaliate? If only a nation can declare war, how do
we engage our military if we have no one against whom we can declare
war?\
\
Also, you make it sound as if Afghanistan and Iraq are blameless. They
should have been \"actively\" contributing to the ouster of Al Qaeda
from their country. Not only did they not help, they stonewalled us at
every turn. The only way we killed OBL is by concealing the operation
from Afghanistan.\

We live in an imperfect world. Black and white is never an
option.]{.rendered_qtext}
