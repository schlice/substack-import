You don't really have to worry about the details, because you can't do
it without an attorney's help. The attorney will take care of the
specifics.

The laws are different in every state, but there are some things which
are universal. First and foremost, a vote for dissolution will need to
be done. The entire HOA will need to vote, and in most states, you need
no less than 80% of the owners to approve the dissolution. Some states
may have less (like a simple majority or 60%) and some states may
require more. Remember that because dissolving an HOA will have to be
placed to a vote, if the vote fails, you may be inciting further
division among the residents.

Additionally, most HOAs are actually 501(c)(4) non-profit corporations
which are governed by state laws for corporations. There are separate
dissolution requirements for them as well. Your attorney will help you
with those as well.

Some of the things which will need to be resolved prior to the HOA
dissolving:

- Ownership of common property. Someone will have to be ceded ownership
  of any of the common property the HOA used to own. The property will
  either need to be gifted or sold to the new owners. Utilities and
  deeds will need to be transferred and re-filed. In the case of water
  systems (i.e. sprinklers in common areas), plumbing changes may need
  to be made to tie in previously separate systems.
- Along with changing the ownership of the common property comes changes
  to the insurance coverage on the property.
- The former duties of the HOA will have to be taken on by someone. This
  includes common area maintenance and facilities management.
- Every condo owner's deed is going to have to be amended and re-filed
  to show that there is no longer a condo association. This will require
  signatures of 100% of the condo owners.
- The HOA will need to resolve any outstanding debts before it is
  closed.
