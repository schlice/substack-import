Then maybe you should be looking at Apple to say, why ***CAN*** you get
into this phone? You shouldn\'t be able to!

If you can\'t trust the government, your only other alternative is to
build a better phone.

Also, don\'t forget the 5C is old tech. It has no encryption chip like
newer iPhones; all the encryption is done in (reprogrammable) software.
