Radar is one component of our missile early warning system. It is used
along with infrared satellite-based sensors to form **dual
phenomenology** when identifying a launch event. We have PARCS radars
along both US coasts. A missile event is not fully reported until we
have dual phenomenology.

Raw radar data is literally useless until it is correlated at a
correlation center (like NORAD). Additionally, it rides on classified
point-to-point comm circuits, as missile launch events are classified
until the event is concluded, so raw radar data cannot be made public.
