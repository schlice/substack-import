An article was posted in USA Today in September of 2014 about this very
scenario.

[[Statutory rape victim forced to pay child
support](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=86c6e3&url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/09/02/statutory-rape-victim-child-support/14953965/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="usatoday.com"}]{.qlink_container}

The upshot of the article is a few things:

1.  Child support is not for the rapist, nor is it punitive damages for
    a rape victim. It is intended to ensure a child is cared for.
2.  Most states will come after the other parent for child support,
    regardless of how the pregnancy happened.
3.  The only exceptions to this occur if the petitioning parent is
    guilty of sexual assault, or sexual assault with a minor, and not
    all states have this exemption.
