**What if you will not go to heaven unless you give others your material
possession? Explain please.**

It is only faith in Jesus that brings eternal life.

> *For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that
> whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. ---
> John 3:16 NIV*

Notice the text: **whoever believes in him,** which means that anyone
who believes that he is God and he died for your sins is eligible. Then
it says **shall not perish,** which means that those who choose to not
believe *shall perish*. Finally, it says **but have eternal life,**
which indicates the reward for believing.

However, if you have been saved, wouldn't that generate good deeds
(which include helping the poor by donating things)? The Bible says that
it will.

Faith and action work together. You don't have faith without action.
This is why you'll often see people say "faith without works is dead."
So if you say you have faith but you do not do good works, do you really
have faith?

There isn't a set requirement for what you must do, but God expects us
to do good works to complete the faith.

**The faith saves you, the works complete you.**
