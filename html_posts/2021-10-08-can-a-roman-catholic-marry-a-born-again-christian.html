Let me see if I can answer your question without labeling you, judging
you, or telling you what you should or shouldn't do.

***CAN*** you marry without switching your religions? Yes. You can be
married in either a nondenominational Christian ceremony, or in a
Catholic ceremony; neither group would deny either of you. If I recall
correctly, if the Catholic is married outside of a Catholic church, the
marriage would need to be blessed by a priest in order to be a valid
Catholic marriage.

Now, we get to the question of whether or not you ***SHOULD*** do so.
I'm not going to tell you what you should do. I'll simply give you the
information you need and let you decide.

[[Michael

was the closest to giving you a biblically-based answer when he talked
about being "unevenly yoked." The Scripture he is referring to is:

> Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership has
> righteousness with lawlessness? Or what fellowship has light with
> darkness? What accord has Christ with Belial? Or what portion does a
> believer share with an unbeliever? --- 2 Corinthians 6:14-15 ESV

There are other parts of the Bible that talk about this same concept.
However, in this case, the Bible passage is referring to a believer
marrying an unbeliever.

And here is where we get into the rub of the topic. You are both,
technically, "believers." But you believe the same things in different
ways. And as a former Roman Catholic now Christian, I can tell you that
they are *vastly* different. I can't say that they are "one's going to
Heaven and the other's questionable" different, but I can say that the
differences are more than superficial.

And you'll need to think about these things. When you have children,
which religion will you raise them under? What they learn and how they
learn it will be different for both of you.

Good luck!
