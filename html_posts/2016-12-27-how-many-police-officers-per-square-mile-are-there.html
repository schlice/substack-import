So clearly you are looking for an average, since there is no consistency
in any of those numbers. Large cities can have thousands of officers,
while there are many small departments (several thousand if I remember
correctly) which have just one officer or sheriff.

So let's run the numbers:

There are anywhere from 500,000 to upwards of 900,000 sworn officers in
the United States, full-time and part-time, amongst all Federal, State
and local agencies, performing all law enforcement duties.

There are 3.797 million square miles of land in the United States.

Doing the math, that gives you anywhere from 0.131 to 0.237 officers per
square mile, or, **on average**, roughly one officer per every 5 square
miles.

But again, this is a very simplistic view, as officer density is not
tied to acerage. Officer density is tied to ***population density***, so
instead of officers per square mile, we generally look at ***number of
officers per 100,000 people.*** In this way, areas with higher
population density will have a much higher number of officers than an
area with much greater landmass and a much smaller population density.
This is why major metropolitan police departments can have *thousands*
of officers, while many small departments can have just one county
sheriff.
