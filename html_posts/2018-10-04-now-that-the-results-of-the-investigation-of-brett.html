**Now that the results of the investigation of Brett Kavanaugh have
shown his innocence, is the FBI or any other officer going to arrest
Ford for falsely accusing someone for a crime and Diane Feinstein for
withholding evidence of an alleged crime?**

1.  Christine Blasey Ford may have made a reckless accusation without
    corroboration, *but she truly believes what she remembers*. **This
    does not qualify as a false accusation**. A false accusation is
    where you know the truth, but deliberately speak a falsehood in
    order to deceive. This is not what Dr. Ford did.
2.  The Senate Judiciary Committee is absolutely going to investigate
    where the "leak" of Ford's letter came from. Whether or not they
    refer Sen. Feinstein to the Ethics Committee for failing to report
    information for investigation until the last minute remains to be
    seen. But there is no crime here, it's just an allegation of past
    bad behavior. There's no crime, so she didn't withhold evidence of a
    crime.
