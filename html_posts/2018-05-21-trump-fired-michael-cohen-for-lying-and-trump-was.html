**Trump fired Michael Cohen for lying, and Trump was Michael Flynn\'s
boss. So, why can't the American people fire Trump for lying to us as
well? After all, aren\'t the American people the \"boss\" of the
president?**

Trump can hire and fire personnel for the Executive Branch as he is the
head of that branch. However, to continue the analogy, the American
people are not "in charge" of the Office of the President. The President
is accountable to the people he serves, but we don't run his office.

The American people can fire Trump by not voting for him again. It's
built in to the Constitution. Congress can fire Trump by impeaching him
for "high crimes and misdemeanors." It's also built in to the
Constitution.
