**Is multiple sclerosis fatal?**

We used to say that MS itself is not fatal, but you can be killed by the
secondary effects of the disease.

It's more accurate to say that because of medications which slow down
the disease process and lessen its effect, lifespans for people with MS
tend to match fairly closely with those who do not have the disease.

Some recent studies have shown that people with MS have been living, on
average, seven years fewer than people without the disease, mostly
caused by disease complications and other related conditions. Many of
these related conditions and complications are manageable, or even
preventable. Examples of related conditions in the study were heart
disease and stroke. Maintaining overall health and a healthy lifestyle
will be of great benefit in disease management.

That all said, there are a few rare cases of MS which can progress very
rapidly from disease onset, and can be fatal.

Continue to work closely with your care team, including your
neurologist. Follow their advice and stay healthy.
