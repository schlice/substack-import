What if the moon is made of cheese? What if Deadpool was actually real?
What if my dog actually understands what I'm saying?

Our imaginations can be pretty vivid sometimes. But we shouldn't allow
our imaginations to drive what we know as truth.

We should rely on the Bible for our truth, as Christians.

In truth, Hell is locked from the inside. The people who will be in
hell, placed themselves there. They chose to ignore God's gift. They
willingly gave up that gift because they wanted to be in control of
their own life choices. They could have chosen to obey God, but they
chose not to. They are in hell because they choose to continue to ignore
God. That's why we say the door to hell is locked from the inside. The
people in hell put themselves there willingly.
