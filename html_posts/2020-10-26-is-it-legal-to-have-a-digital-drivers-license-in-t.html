**Is it legal to have a digital drivers license in the United States?**

A few states are working on implementing digital driver's licenses
through an app on your phone. They haven't quite gotten it fully rolled
out yet. Last year, Colorado was piloting a program for digital
licenses, and as far as I know, that's as far as these programs have
gotten thus far.

Currently, having a picture of your license on your phone does not
qualify as having your license on you while driving a car.
