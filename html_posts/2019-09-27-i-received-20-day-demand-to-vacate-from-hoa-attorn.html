**Got 20 day demand to vacate from HOA for me & unapproved renters for
criminal activity (didn't know about it) while I was away recovering
from injury (I'm 80) in Florida. If I evict renters, can they still
evict me? HOA/lawyers won't return my calls**

thanks for your question, but I really have nothing more to add other
than what [[Jay

in his answer.

It sounds like a really complex situation involving a property you own
and some potential violations of your Rules & Regulations regarding
renters. But there's a lot of moving parts here, and anything we answer
would be unnecessarily confusing and would really do you a disservice.

I strongly suggest you get in contact with a real estate attorney in
your local area who specializes in HOA law.
