**Content:** [The pressure you\'re feeling is the difference between the
pressure on the inside of your ear and the outside of your ear.\

\
Your inner and outer ear are separated by your eardrum, which is a thin
membrane that vibrates when sound waves hit it, which allows you to
hear.\
\
You can see in the diagram that your eardrum separates the ***outer
ear*** (the tan part) from the ***middle ear*** (the red part). The air
pressure is balanced by the Eustachian tube (in the diagram above as the
\"Auditory tube\"). The Eustachian tube enters the back of the throat to
balance that pressure.\
\
One of the problems that often occurs is that sinus drainage or sinus
blockage will block the Eustachian tube and prevent that pressure from
equalizing normally. This will result in \"clicks\" or \"pops\" being
heard during ascent or descent (while pressure is changing). In some
instances, the sinuses cause such significant blockage that pressure
doesn\'t change at all, causing pain as the eardrum is stretched by the
difference in pressure between the outer and inner ear.\
\
One of the things that pilots are taught (as well as scuba divers for
the same reason) is what\'s referred to as the [[Valsalva
maneuver](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=523f14&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valsalva_maneuver){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}. This is essentially
forcing air up into the Eustachian tube in order to equalize pressure on
both sides of the ear drum. To perform the Valsalva maneuver, pinch your
nose and try to blow out your pinched nose. Don\'t do this too
forcefully or you could hurt your ears, but if you do it moderately
forcefully, you will hear pops and cracks as air is forced into your
middle ear.
