**Would it be illegal to wear a security guard outfit as a regular
person?**

No.

It's not even illegal to wear a security guard outfit and act as a
security guard!

The security guard company may have a problem with it, as you are not a
certified security guard. They're certainly not going to pay you. And
other, real security guards will probably ask you to leave.
