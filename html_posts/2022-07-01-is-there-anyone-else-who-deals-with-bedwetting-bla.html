Ha, here I am! Look, I'm no spring chicken (I have a few years on you),
but I'm not in the age range that I should be spending time in the
incontinence section of Walgreen's.

You should know that in MS, bowel and bladder issues are one of the most
common symptoms reported. According to our friends over at NMSS:

> Bladder dysfunction, which occurs in at least 80 percent of people
> with MS, happens when MS lesions block or delay transmission of nerve
> signals in areas of the central nervous system (CNS) that control the
> bladder and urinary sphincters. A spastic (overactive) bladder that is
> unable to hold the normal amount of urine, or a bladder that does not
> empty properly (retains some urine in it) can cause symptoms
> including:
>
> - Frequency and/or urgency of urination
> - Hesitancy in starting urination
> - Frequent nighttime urination (nocturia)
> - Incontinence (the inability to hold in urine)
> - Inability to empty the bladder completely

So it's never our place here in the MS Forum to diagnose or attempt to
treat any disease or condition; we're not doctors. But I can tell you
what I've done that works for me. Remember, your mileage may vary, never
start, stop, or change treatments without first talking to your doctor,
etc.

I started treatment with a urologist, and the first step is medication,
before we go to more invasive procedures. I began with the
*under-active* bladder that I couldn't empty. It caused secondary
symptoms like swelling in the prostate. The signals simply weren't
making it strong enough to the bladder. So I started on a low, daily
dose of Tamsulosin (Flomax). (And btw, does anyone remember the
cringe-worthy advertisements for Flomax when it was still name-brand
only? oof!) That worked great...until it didn't. I then started swinging
the other way (the overactive bladder). I was getting daytime leakage,
inability to hold urine, frequency/urgency, etc. My problem, though, is
that every urgency control medicine had some sort of really severe
reaction with what I was already taking, but round about that time, a
new drug, Gemtesa, was released specifically to treat overactive bladder
(OAB) but while avoiding those serious side-effects. So after fighting
with insurance, I was able to get a prescription for Gemtesa. Those two
drugs, taken in combination, seem to do the trick for me. For now.

I still wear pads. I wear the stick-on pads in my underwear when I go
out (mostly me being neurotic, but it's cheap insurance). But otherwise,
the drugs keep me well controlled for now.

There are other, more aggressive treatments available. You should start
with your neurologist and confirm that your symptoms are MS-related, and
then get a referral to a urologist to help you design some treatment
plans for you.

The good news is that OAB is more common than in just MS patients, so
there are a myriad of treatment options available. We can use most of
those treatments pretty successfully.

Just know going into it that it's going to feel really weird when you go
to your urologist and the waiting room is filled with octogenarians and
walkers, and it smells like a day care...

Original question:

Is there anyone else who deals with bedwetting, bladder, or bowel
incontinence? Im feel like the only one, as Im only 29. I have had to
wear diapers and pull-ups for it, and use bathroom reminders my whole
life due to brain and spine issues.
