<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [The major problem with the CDC investigating gun usage is<br>the implication. Regardless of what they find (which is a clearly<br>slanted view, but more to that in a second), having the CDC investigates<br>gun usage implies that gun usage is a disease.\<br>\<br>Let me put it another way (which I shared in another answer regarding<br>this question). Let\'s say a building falls down. Who is sent to<br>investigate colors the investigation before the first shred of evidence<br>is reviewed. If the police are sent, some color of foul play is<br>introduced. If the fire investigators are sent, the assumption is that<br>some incendiary item started the collapse. If a structural engineer is<br>sent, the assumption is the building was of faulty<br>construction.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Should-guns-be-banned/answer/Nate-Waddoups<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
