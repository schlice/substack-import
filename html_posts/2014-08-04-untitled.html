<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [The major problem with the CDC investigating gun usage is
the implication. Regardless of what they find (which is a clearly
slanted view, but more to that in a second), having the CDC investigates
gun usage implies that gun usage is a disease.\
\
Let me put it another way (which I shared in another answer regarding
this question). Let\'s say a building falls down. Who is sent to
investigate colors the investigation before the first shred of evidence
is reviewed. If the police are sent, some color of foul play is
introduced. If the fire investigators are sent, the assumption is that
some incendiary item started the collapse. If a structural engineer is
sent, the assumption is the building was of faulty
construction.]{.rendered_qtext}
