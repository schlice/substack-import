**How do you get around the whole Posse Comitatus Act?**

Petition your Representatives to repeal it.

Otherwise, the military can't enforce civilian law. And I suspect that's
the way you'd like it. Because the military isn't designed to be local
law enforcement. I think you'd be much happier with your local chief of
police or sheriff than you would be with the Army batallion commander.

(EDIT) Another way to avoid Posse Comitatus is to follow the provisions
of the Insurrection Act. If the Governor went to the President and
claimed an insurrection was more than the fully-constituted National
Guard could handle, the President is authorized to commit troops to the
control of the Governor to quell the insurrection.
