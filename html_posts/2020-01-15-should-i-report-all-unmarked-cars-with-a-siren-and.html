**Should I report all unmarked cars with a siren and flashing lights to
the police if I\'m not sure that they\'re an official emergency response
vehicle?**

The old adage comes to mind: "Stay in your lane."

Nevertheless, if you are concerned about seeing an unmarked vehicle, and
you are unsure it is a police vehicle, please contact the
**NON-EMERGENCY** line at your police department and let them know.

However, if an unmarked vehicle **is attempting to pull you over**, and
you are on a dark road late at night, with no one around, and you are
concerned for your safety, I would absolutely call the **EMERGENCY**
number (In the US, 911) and report that an unmarked vehicle is
attempting to effect a traffic stop, and can they confirm that it is an
actual police officer.
