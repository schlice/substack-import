**Are the police allowed to enter your home without a warrant due to
probable cause?**

No.

Probable cause is enough to get a warrant. Warrants are ridiculously
easy to get these days; officers can get a warrant right on their mobile
phones.

The only way an officer can enter your house without permission or a
warrant is through ***exigent circumstances***. Exigent circumstances
include, but are not limited to: if they believe that someone is hurt,
if they believe that critical evidence is about to be destroyed, or they
believe a criminal is about to escape.
