**Content:** [Why is changing your prices illegal?\
\
The whole concept of a free-market system is that prices are not fixed,
and you as a business can charge whatever you choose for a product or
service.\
\
Similarly, your competitors can charge whatever they choose for the same
product or service.\
\
The one with the best price wins.\
\
How would such a scheme as you have suggested serve the business? How
would it earn the company more money, unless you are talking about
hidden fees?\
\
And isn\'t what you\'re taking about called **supply and demand**? If
demand increases, all else being equal, price goes up. If supply
increases, all else being equal, price goes down. If demand on a
particular service increases, all else being equal, price goes up for
that service.\
\
How the airline determines when to raise the price for a ticket is an
unexplained sniglet of the universe that I will never
understand.]{.rendered_qtext}
