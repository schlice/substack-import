In the United States, everyone has the right to live as they choose.
They also have the right to their own opinions. They can believe
whatever it is that they want to believe. They can practice whatever
religion they choose, or no religion at all. The State will never
sponsor a state religion, so no one will be forced to believe anything.

Those atheists and agnostics you mentioned in your question have the
right to believe that religions cause wars, ignorance, and immorality.
They have the right to live without practicing religion in their lives.

The moment they try to impose their belief onto you, they have crossed a
line.
