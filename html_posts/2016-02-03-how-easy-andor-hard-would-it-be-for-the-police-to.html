If you\'re talking about physically locating a phone, rather easy. The
cryptophone still has a phone number, and still connects and registers
with a cell tower. Therefore, with the proper warrants, the police can
get the location of that handset to within a few city blocks of that
tower. If you\'re moving, triangulation can actually get them even more
precise.

If you\'re talking about the police\'s ability to read your text
messages or listen in on your phone conversations on your cryptophone
(as long as you are communicating with someone else who also has a
cryptophone), then even if the police have a wiretap warrant, they
won\'t hear anything but gibberish, and your SMS messages will be
nothing but unreadable text. Your SMS messages and your voice will all
be encrypted end-to-end between handsets.

If you\'re using third-party services from your cryptophone, you may
still be able to be monitored through those services, so caution is in
order. You will need to use the handset\'s secure mail application, and
the receiving party will need to do the same, when using email.
