I suppose it comes down to why you want to join the military.

Are you looking for work experience? That may be important in other
career fields, but less so in the police department. You will get all
the work experience you need within the department. The training (both
classroom, called academy training, and then OJT, or on-the-job
training) are all very well-formed training programs, so the work
experience is not necessary.

Are you joining the military because you want to serve your country, and
you're trying to find out why, after all the anti-cop rhetoric and
downright hate, these people are *still worth fighting for and
protecting?* Then yeah, maybe some time in the Armed Forces would give
you that perspective, at a much larger scale than your local police
department ever can. No disrespect to my badged sworn brethren, but you
don't get that same perspective when you're in the soup every day.
Directly supporting and defending the Constitution under the authority
of a *Posse Comitatus Act* provides that perspective much better than
hauling puking D&D's all night.
