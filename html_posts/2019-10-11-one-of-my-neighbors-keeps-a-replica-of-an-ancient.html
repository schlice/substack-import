**One of my neighbors keeps a replica of an ancient torture device in
his front yard year round. I find this tasteless,. What options do I
have to have this kind of thing removed?**

Unfortunately in this case, the "replica of an ancient torture device"
is also a recognized religious symbol.

To that end, it is protected by the 1st Amendment, so unfortunately, in
the United States, there is nothing you can do to have it removed.

Your best option is to sell your house and move to a country which
allows religious oppression, so you can suppress those silly symbols.
