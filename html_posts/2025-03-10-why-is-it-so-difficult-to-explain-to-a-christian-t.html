Well,
[[Vlad](https://www.quora.com/profile/Vlad-2082)]{.qlink_container},
most Christians haven't really thought about it much. As [[David
LaRocca](https://www.quora.com/profile/David-LaRocca-6)]{.qlink_container}
said in his excellent answer, most Christians don't require objective
evidence because they believe by faith.

Among those who *have* thought about it, there are two explanations why
it is difficult to explain it to them.

1.  They already know that the Bible isn't "objective" evidence, so they
    see the "objective" evidence in other areas of God's creation, such
    as the information resident in DNA, the creation of the first life,
    and anthropic fine-tuning.
2.  They're using your own standards of objectivity against you. Since
    you can claim (without any concrete evidence) that the first life
    spontaneously self-generated from non-living random chemicals, and
    you can claim (again with zero evidence) that macroevolution (where
    one kind of species evolves into another kind of species) occurred
    and is the most likely cause for our existence, then they can claim
    without objective evidence that the Bible was inspired by God. The
    amounts of "objective" evidence in all of those claims are equal.
