Sure! A parent can also force a child to sign a document which shows
that the Tooth Fairy is real and that the Moon is made of Swiss cheese.

They all have exactly the same weight.

In other words, parents are responsible for children. Parents transfer
students, whether they want to go or not.

Sounds like the document may be something that the parent is using to
have in their back pocket to show the child at some point down the road
that they agreed to this transfer.

It's "parental leverage." It has no other meaning other than that.

If it was coerced when you signed it, it will still be coerced when they
try to use it against you in the future.
