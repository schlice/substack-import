**How do I fucking leave home and the toxic people when I can\'t? The
only way is to become homeless. My life situation doesn\'t grant me way
and I am feeling frustrated.**

Deal with it. Save your money until you can leave home. Get a job and
don't spend your money on crap. Seriously. It's hard to do.

Or leave and become homeless. I'm sure the local shelter will give you a
bed.
