**Are Zyrtec or Claritin safe to take daily all year round? Are there
issues with long term use?**

There are no documented, well-known issues with long-term use *so far*.
These second-generation antihistamines have only been around for roughly
ten years, so there isn't much longer-term studies that have been done
than that amount of time. But from what we have so far, there isn't
anything which has been documented which shows any known long-term issue
with their use.

There are, of course, anecdotal issues that occur. But there is nothing
documented to show repeatable, known long-term issues.
