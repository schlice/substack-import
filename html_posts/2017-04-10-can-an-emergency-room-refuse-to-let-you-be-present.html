Because you weren't carrying a copy of her signed **Durable Medical
Power of Attorney**.

I'm assuming that because you said "partner" that you're not married.
It's an assumption. If it's wrong, you can edit your question's details.

You can only accompany your spouse (whatever spousal arrangements are
legal in your state), or the person for whom you have been
pre-authorized to make medical decisions. Any partners can make medical
decisions for any other partners, married or not. You simply must have a
**Durable Medical Power of Attorney** signed by your partner, and you
have to be able to produce that document.

Of course, if she is conscious, she can make her own medical decisions,
power of attorney or not.

*(Note that I am not a lawyer and I am not giving you binding legal
advice; depending on what state you live in, the rules may be
different).*
