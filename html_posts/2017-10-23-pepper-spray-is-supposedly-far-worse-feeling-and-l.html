Nothing is fool-proof to the talented fool.

That said, you can go either way. Pepper spray is almost universally
effective and will allow you the time needed to escape. So in terms of
statistical percentages, you'll have a better chance getting away with
pepper spray. Yes, there is a small number of people who seem to be
immune to the effects of pepper spray, but weighing your odds, it's
statistically unlikely you'd find one of those people to be your
attacker.

You can also do this with a Taser, despite the fact that the effects
subside virtually instantly once the unit is switched off. To achieve
this, one mode of operation on the civilian Taser (the Bolt and Pulse
have this feature) involves deploying the barbs, incapacitating the
subject, and turning on "multi-cycle mode" which deploys the charge,
deactivates for a few seconds, and deploys the charge again. It
continues this cycle until it is stopped or the battery is depleted. The
idea is that if you deploy the Taser in this way, you put the unit down,
letting the multi-cycle mode continue, and get away. Axon (the company
that produces the Taser) will replace a Taser deployed in this manner
for free if you give them a copy of the police report showing that it
was used like this. Both the Bolt and the Pulse use the new "shaped
charge" technology which is more effective through clothing, so it's
more likely to do what you want it to do. However, the Taser has a
higher likelihood of failure. The distance on the civilian Tasers is
limited to 15 feet, and if you miss, it's completely ineffective.
