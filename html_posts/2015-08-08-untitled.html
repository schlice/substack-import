**Content:** [*There is no cure i.e. for everyone*\
There is no cure, period. As I have mentioned many times on many
different forums (including this one), if you were diagnosed with MS and
you did XYZ and it \"cured\" your MS, you didn\'t have MS. I challenge
you to show me any peer-reviewed medical proof that shows that anything
other than what I just stated is actually true.\
\
That\'s not a controversial statement. It\'s medical fact. Until someone
proves otherwise, it is the current medical understanding of MS. The
disease is incurable today.\
\
That said, you can do a lot to slow the progression of the disease and
get your body to a point where you hardly notice your MS at all. I\'m
coping wonderfully. I hardly notice my MS. That doesn\'t mean I\'m
\"cured.\" It\'s not even a \"functional cure\" like you can get with
HIV or some other diseases. It\'s simply remission to the point of
indistinguishability from normalcy.]{.rendered_qtext}
