While I agree with all of the posters, I would have to echo
[[Lisa\'s](https://www.quora.com/profile/Lisa-Scroggins)]{.qlink_container}
advice first and foremost.

If you are a person who is diagnosed with MS, I can\'t suggest strongly
enough that you start one of the approved MS treatment drugs. I would
caution anyone in following any other advice about any other "treatment"
exclusively. Eating right and exercising are exceedingly helpful to
anyone, but are especially helpful to anyone who has MS. Using
complementary and alternative medicines can also help many people.
However, doing these things **and at the same time excluding approved
treatments** is strongly discouraged, since eating right and exercising
**will not slow the disease progression**. They will definitely improve
your quality of life and will maintain your overall health, but the
disease will continue to silently progress.

We must be clear about this point, regardless of what you may have heard
on the Internet or what you heard anecdotally from someone. **Changing
your diet alone will not slow down or stop Multiple Sclerosis. There is
no \"magic diet\" that will cure MS.** If you \"had MS\" and you changed
your diet and it \"cured your MS,\" you didn\'t have MS. You had
something else that mimicked MS, but you did not have MS. There is not a
single doctor out there who can show true randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled studies that prove that a diet will cure MS.

I can\'t stress this enough: eat right, exercise, **and** take an
approved MS therapy drug. Over 20 years of research show us that the
approved therapies work, and using them in conjunction with lifestyle
modification offers you the best chance for successfully managing the
disease.

(EDIT) I want to make this point clear as well.

**There currently is no cure for MS.** So, what's a "cure?" A cure, in
the medical context, means that the disease *reverses course*. Any
damage done by the disease is healed, and there is *zero trace of the
disease* anywhere in the body. The disease is *gone*. There is no
further disease process, and further medications become unnecessary and
superfluous.

In this context, there is **no cure** for MS. There is no diet which
will cure MS. There is no treatment of any kind which will cure MS. Even
the approved MS ***therapy*** drugs cannot cure MS. However, the drugs
*do* slow down the disease progression, reduce the severity and duration
of relapses, and increase the amount of time between relapses.

*Can't a diet do those things?* A diet can make the relapses less
severe, **but it has zero effect on the disease course.** The disease
will continue to progress, and the relapses will continue to come. For
someone with MS, the relapses will not slow down due to diet.

The closest we have to a "cure" right now is Autologous Hematopoietic
Stem Cell Therapy (aHSCT). This treatment has been used for cancer
patients for decades, and has only recently been approved for trials for
MS patients in the US. Basically, it is a process by which the immune
system of the body is "reset." The body's red blood cell-generating bone
marrow is destroyed, and then it is re-created using the body's own stem
cells. It is an extreme procedure, and it is not without risk. Once the
chemotherapy is started, the *entire immune system is destroyed*. No T
lymphocytes will be created. The patient must stay in isolation to avoid
any disease, because even a cold virus can kill them at that point, as
the body has no effective means to fight it.

For some patients who have not been helped by traditional high-efficacy
DMTs, aHSCT has either radically slowed, or eliminated, the disease.
