**How do we know that the credentials of the people who answer these
questions are legit? I could easily say that I was a professional
psychiatrist et. al. What do you all think?**

You don't.

Originally when Quora was founded, that was the idea. Credentials would
be verified, and you would know that you were getting answers from
people who were legitimate.

However, that model was deemed to be too unworkable. It was supplanted
by, and eschewed in favor of, the **upvote** system.

- An **upvote** is given for *high-quality content*, not for content
  with which you personally agree.
- A **downvote** is given for *low-quality content.*

Additionally, if content is factually incorrect, the content can be
reported to Quora Moderation for removal.

The idea is much more akin to the way many individual editors make
Wikipedia a quality product. Many individual upvoters validating the
quality of the content make it valuable. It's often confused with the
"like" system that everyone knows from Facebook: popular content gets
"liked," but there's no "dislike" button in Facebook. There's a downvote
button in Quora. That's because the **upvote** system is unlike the
**likes** system in that you don't upvote answers or comments with which
you agree. You upvote answers or comments which are *accurate, and
high-quality.*

Finally, you cited "professional psychiatrist" as something you could
masquerade as while answering. **Understand that answers given on Quora
are not professional advice.** Lawyers who answer on Quora are not
providing legal advice. Doctors who answer on Quora are not providing
professional medical advice. Answers provided on Quora are for *general
informational use only*. If you need a psychiatrist, you should go see
one. You shouldn't be asking random strangers on the Internet about your
psychological issues.
