*God is working all the time, making his plans for you come to
fruition*. Whether you ask him or not, he is working in your life, to
fulfill his plans for you.

But whether or not he is "helping you" is a matter of opinion. If his
plans match what you believe is helpful to your life, then he is helping
you. If they don't, you might think his plans aren't very helpful.

Regardless, he is making his plans come true in your life. What he will
*never* do is harm you.

> "For I know the plans I have for you," declares the Lord, "plans to
> prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future."
> ---Jeremiah 29:11 NIV

You may not think his plans are helpful, but that's simply a
misunderstanding. That is you, judging God's plans by your standards.

Instead, pray for God to bring you alongside his plans. Pray to be
included in his plan, so that you can not only more fully appreciate
them, but you can maybe work *with* him to achieve his goals for your
life. He will prosper you, if you let him.
