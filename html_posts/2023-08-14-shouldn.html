I think that's a pretty short-sighted view of things.

Let's do "turnabout is fair play" today.

I say, **The lack of evidence for the existence of gravity should be
considered evidence for the non-existence of gravity.**

To which you would immediately say: *Nonsense! Without gravity, we'd all
just float off of the surface of the planet!*

True, but what is gravity made of? What is the atomic weight of gravity?
Gravity is not a thing, so gravity must not exist.

Clearly, the argument is nonsense, you'd reply, because we can see the
*effect* of gravity all around us, even if we can't see the *cause*.

Thank you for making my point for me, I would say.

Science cannot account for everything. In fact, there are many things
that scientific inquiry cannot explain, but we are all rational to
accept. For example:

1.  mathematics and logic (science can't prove them because science
    presupposes them)
2.  metaphysical truths (such as, there are minds that exist other than
    my own)
3.  ethical judgments (you can't prove by science that the Nazis were
    evil, because morality is not subject to the scientific method)
4.  aesthetic judgments (the beautiful, like the good, cannot be
    scientifically proven), and, ironically
5.  science itself (the belief that the scientific method discovers
    truth can't be proven by the scientific method itself)

So no, the lack of "evidence" which proves the existence of something
should not be considered evidence that something does not exist.

\

We should discuss whether or not you can actually *prove* that something
*does not* exist. Philosopher and scholar Mortimer Adler said, "An
affirmative existential proposition can be proven, but a negative
existential proposition---one which denies the existence of
something---cannot be proven." For example, I can tell you that red
eagles exist, and you can tell me that red eagles do not exist. I only
need to show you one example, at any point in history, to prove that red
eagles exist. You would need to be present at all places and at all
times to prove that red eagles do not, and have never, existed. This, of
course, is impossible to do.

\

Finally, I take issue with your statement regarding "evidence." What is
it that constitutes "evidence" of the existence of God? Is it the
material sciences? Because as I've already shown, there are plenty of
things which exist outside of the realm of material science which we are
all rational to accept (and we probably daily accept).

So if God cannot be proven through the use of the material sciences, how
can God be proven? We use the other methods of scientific inquiry:
logic, philosophy, and forensics. These are all valid methods of
scientific inquiry, even if they do not involve the material, physical
sciences. Science is, at its core, a search for causes. In fact, Francis
Bacon (the father of modern science) said, "True knowledge is knowledge
by causes." That's what scientists do---they try to discover what caused
what.

So we can use logic, philosophy, and forensics to prove that a creator
God exists. But you have to accept these lines of scientific inquiry as
valid before you can accept that a creator God exists. And most people
who say there is "no evidence" for the existence of God simply don't
accept logic or forensics as "evidence."
