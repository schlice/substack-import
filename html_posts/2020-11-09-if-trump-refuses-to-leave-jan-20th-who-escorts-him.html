**If Trump refuses to leave Jan 20th, who escorts him out, US Marshals,
Secret Service, Capitol Police, or someone else?**

We will have a clear, legally-declared winner by January 20th.

Trump will comply with this, as if he needs to leave, he has to move his
personal effects out of the private quarters, and the transition team
will be performing that function, not Trump himself.

There's a lot of people involved in the process, but this isn't about
some sort of intransigence on Trump's part, like the mainstream media
wants you to believe.

The election is not over yet. No state has officially declared a winner
of any state election. Not to mention, there are legal processes that
are ongoing in several states. Granted, Trump's lawyers have a tough row
to hoe here. They have to make the claim that not only were there
election irregularities (and they must be specific to the jurisdiction
where they are making the case), but those irregularities were of a
sufficient amount to make up the difference between the two candidates'
current vote totals. If they can make that case, then the results of the
election will change. If they cannot, then the results will be certified
by the states (which has not happened yet), and the election will stay
the same. If Trump's legal team has the evidence they need, they have
the right, and even Biden supporters should agree, they have the *duty*,
to ensure that the evidence is processed and that the elections are all
discharged in a fair manner. Until this process concludes, no one has
been declared the next president yet.

There are pre-defined timelines by which the legal challenges must be
concluded, the states must certify their elections, and they must
deliver their results to the Federal government. So there will indeed be
a known winner by then. But it hasn't happened yet.

The media does not have the power to declare a president. They can only
*project* a winner. Calling him "President-elect Biden" is
short-sighted. They may turn out to be right, but they may not. What
sort of message does that send if they have to walk that back, though?
Don't you think that causes more harm than good?

Regardless, as Yogi Berra famously said, "It ain't over 'till it's
over."
