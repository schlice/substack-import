**Is it legal for an HOA to ban drones if the hobbyist is complying with
federal laws?**

Yes, it is legal for an HOA to ban drones.

HOAs have broad authority over the areas which they control. They can
absolutely pass a Rule change which bans the use of drones **from within
the neighborhood. This means that you can't take off or land in the
neighborhood.**

Note the bolded statement above. If you are outside the neighborhood and
you *overfly* the neighborhood, **this is legal**, so long as you comply
with all other local regulations (which usually follow FAA regulations)
for drone flight. The FAA controls airspace above your house, not the
HOA.
