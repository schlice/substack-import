**Content:** [No, that\'s an *expression*, not a statement of fact, and
certainly not a predictor of the future.\
\
And it\'s not even the right expression. The original expression is
\"Live by the sword, die by the sword.\" It came from the Bible (Matthew
26:52 - \"Put your sword back in its place,\" Jesus said to him, \"for
all who draw the sword will die by the sword.\"). It basically is a
teaching which says that if you seek to use violence against people, you
can expect that the same methods will be used against you.\
\
But if you\'re going to use Biblical references, then understand that
the Bible teaches that there are appropriate times and places to use
force. Defending your family and defending your home, for example, are
called out specifically as areas in which it is acceptable to use
force.]{.rendered_qtext}
