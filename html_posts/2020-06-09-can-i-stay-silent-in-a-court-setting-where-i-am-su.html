**Can you stay silent in a court setting where you are supposed to be
giving a testimony on the witness stand? Could there be legal
consequences to that? Is that considered perjury?**

It's not perjury. It's a different offense: **contempt of court**.

If you have been called to testify and you have been placed under oath,
and you are asked a question, you are expected to answer that question.
You are expected not to lie (since you have been placed under oath).
Lying would be perjury.

But if you have been called to testify and you sit silently, the judge
will direct you to answer the question. Remaining silent and failing to
answer the question after the judge directs you to do so is considered
**contempt of court**. Contempt is a process crime, and if a judge finds
you in contempt, you can be fined, or jailed. Immediately. As in the
deputy in the courtroom will arrest you on the spot and take you to the
county jail. You will be held there until you agree to testify. Which
could be a long time if you're stubborn.

You might be remaining silent because if you answer the question, you
would be admitting that you committed a crime (for example, the only way
you could know that the defendant was robbing a jewelry store was if you
were there or you conspired with him). The 5th Amendment says that you
cannot be a witness against yourself, so you can assert at that point
that answering that question would violate your rights under the 5th
Amendment, or to use shorthand, you can "plead the 5th." In general,
this doesn't happen, because the prosecutor would have offered you an
"immunity agreement" whereby you acknowledge that you did something
illegal, but under your agreement, you won't be charged for it because
you agree to testify against the defendant.

If instead you are asked a question and you don't answer completely, or
you don't actually answer the question, or you are otherwise combative
or uncooperative when answering, the attorney can ask the judge to
declare you a "hostile witness." If that happens, the attorney is then
allowed to ask you leading questions, which either imply the answer
(such as, "You saw my client at the club that night, correct?"), or
challenge your testimony (such as "Didn't you say in that email that you
saw my client at the club that night? No? Here's a copy of the email,
please read the highlighted section"). In general, leading questions are
only allowed during cross-examination, but if you are declared a hostile
witness, this exception is made.
