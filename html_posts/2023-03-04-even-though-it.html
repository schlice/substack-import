Of course! It's a wonderfully creative story. I bet it could easily be
turned into a book or even a made-for-TV movie.

But the fact that it exists doesn't make it plausible, or even Biblical
reality.

Revelation is very clear about how the end times are going to look, as
revealed to the apostle John. There will be wars, famine, disease, and
great world suffering for 3.5 years. Then, the antichrist will be
revealed, but he won't come as a demon or a monster. He'll come as a
beautiful savior, almost indistinguishable from Christ, but instead of
saving the world, he will *enslave* the world. He will require that if
you want to participate at all in his new world order, you'll have to
take a mark, either on your forehead or on your hand, that will allow
you to participate in society, and will denote your absolute fealty to
him.

It will be a visible mark, so even if it's a biochip, it will still be
visible. Everyone will know, just by looking at you, whether or not you
took the mark. And anyone who does not take the mark will be unable to
participate in society. No stores, no movies, no malls, no doctors,
nothing.

And eventually, those without the mark will be rounded up and killed,
because any ills which befall the marked will be blamed on the unmarked

This is the time of the Great Tribulation, the time when the unmarked
are tortured and killed.

And at some point during the Great Tribulation, Christ will return. He
will resurrect the believers and take them up to heaven. And then, God
brings the pain. The Day of the Lord will come. And he won't flood the
whole earth with water, but with fire. He will destroy everyone and
everything that remains on the earth. He will finally put Satan and his
minions into the lake of fire to be tormented for all of eternity. Then
He will destroy sin, restore the world, and lift up Israel (the 144,000
who bear the Mark of the Lord) and they will reign for 1,000 years.
