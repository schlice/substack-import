**Why did Trump tell Evangelicals in a recent meeting at the W H that if
Republicans lose the House and Senate there will be violence?**

As usual, Trump's comments were twisted and taken out of context.

He certainly wasn't saying that Republicans would be violent if
Democrats win. But never let the truth get in the way of your clickbait.

What Trump actually warned the Evangelical leaders he had at the White
House was that if Democrats re-take the House, they "will overturn
everything that we've done and they'll do it quickly and
violently."[\[1\]](#JWckq){#cite-JWckq .citation_link}

**If he\'s impeached will there be greater violence?**

If he's impeached, there will only be President Pence, and Trump's
agenda will continue unabated, just with fewer tweets.
