**Content:** [Some of the answers on this page that characterize
Christians are quite wrong. The Bible says that Jesus said that He is
the only way to get to heaven. \"I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life.
No one comes to the Father except through Me.\" ([[John
14:6](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9849d5&url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search%3DJohn%2B14:6){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"

\
It is true that salvation is a **gift**, which means you don\'t have to
\"do\" anything special to \"earn\" it. But in order to receive your
gift, you do have to \"take\" it, and \"acknowledge\" it. Generally,
people do this when receiving a gift. Your only requirement is to
acknowledge that Jesus is your Lord and Savior and that He died for your
sins. That\'s it. Once you have truly accepted that Jesus is your
personal savior who died for your sins, the Bible teaches that you are
\"saved.\" You don\'t need good works to go to Heaven. God\'s grace
begets good works, not the other way around.\
\
Once you have accepted your gift, what then do you do with the rest of
your life? You learn more about what it means to be a follower of
Christ, and you do your utmost to pattern your life after His, the most
perfect example of any life you can follow. You also try to follow
Jesus\' teachings: \"As the Father has sent me, so I send you.\" ([[John
20:21](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=eea031&url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search%3Djohn%2B20%253A21-23%26version%3DNIV){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="biblegateway.com"}]{.qlink_container}). It is what we refer
to as the Great Commission: \"Therefore go and make disciples of all
nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of
the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded
you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.\"
([[Matthew
28:19-20)](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=905b2e&url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search%3DMatthew%2B28%253A19-20%26version%3DNIV){.external_link

This is, of course, a very simplistic view of the \"going to Heaven\"
story, and there is so much deep meaning and interconnectedness in the
Bible that it does take a lifetime of study to master it, but if you
believe that the Bible is the inspired word of God and is infallible,
then you believe that what Jesus said is indeed true, and the only way
to get to Heaven is to believe in Jesus as your savior.\
\
(ED) I was reading over some of the other answers and I wanted to add
something. It does seem pretty sad that some may not get to \"heaven\".
But what is \"heaven\" anyway? Is it a place? Is it a location? I
believe it is a state of being, in oneness with God, feeling the
fullness of His love for eternity. Conversely, \"hell\" is a state of
being in complete and utter separation from God\'s love, completely
isolated, completely alone, forever. The Bible says that Jesus is the
only way to get to heaven. And if we truly believe that Jesus is the son
of God, we cannot fail to believe what he said. Jesus is the only
founder of a religion who claimed to be God (the Trinity is all three,
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, one God, three persons). Every other
religious founder was a \"prophet\" or a \"sage\" or some other form of
\"enlightened person.\" Jesus is the only founder of a religion who was
actually God. Every other religion is prophets pointing us to God;
Christianity is the only religion in which God tells us how to get back
to Himself. I think that is telling indeed. We are all sinners and have
all fallen short of the glory of God. Jesus, through His conquering of
death and His resurrection, opened the door for us to reunite with God.
The only way for us to get back into that state of oneness with God is
by leveraging Christ\'s death and resurrection. All we have to do is
believe that this is true and repent, and that gift is
ours.]{.rendered_qtext}
