I\'ll reply here, because I agree with your sentiment.

The only item I would add:

*So an adaptation of the UDHR one would suppose?*

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is a document developed and
owned by the United Nations. While it is binding on member nations, it
does not impose any legal requirements for member nations to restructure
their laws to match it. It is up to member nations to structure their
laws and governmental practices to line up in accordance with its
precepts. It is basically a \"guide\" for which member nations should
strive. US law does not address every item in the UDHR because of the
structure of the Constitution and the nature of a free society, but in
practice, we meet most of them.
