**Can I join the Air Force Academy with -5.50 vision? They can be
perfectly corrected with glasses/contacts.**

I don't have much to add to [[Zenen

excellent answer. It's great to see that current cadets are
participating here on Quora. It's funny, as grads, we often say that no
one who came after us had it as tough as we did. But in this case, with
this virus, I can safely say that Zenen and his classmates are having a
really tough go of it. I'm glad to see the participation.

Anyway, here's the current admissions standards for people wishing to
apply to the Academy:

> **Visual Acuity**
>
> Current distant visual acuity of any degree that does not correct with
> spectacle lenses to at least 20/40 in each eye. Current near visual
> acuity of any degree that does not correct to 20/40 in the better eye.
>
> **Refractive Error**
>
> Current refractive error (hyperopia, myopia, astigmatism) in excess of
> -8.00 or +8.00 diopters spherical equivalent or astigmatism in excess
> of 3.00 diopters.[\[1\]](#GoREw){#cite-GoREw .citation_link}

Your correctable vision is perfectly acceptable to become a cadet at
USAFA.

I strongly suggest you take a look at the [[Academy
Admissions](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=60e33c&url=https://www.academyadmissions.com/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="academyadmissions.com"}]{.qlink_container} website. There is
a wealth of information on there for potential cadets, and I truly wish
you good luck in your journey.
