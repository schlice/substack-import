**Is an American service member required to get their family members
military ID cards?**

Technically no, but if they want to access any of the base services (or
access the base at all) they're going to need them. Especially if you're
living on base, it would be difficult to get to your house if you didn't
have military ID to let you in.

They are going to get healthcare from the military. They need an ID card
for that.

They are going to shop for groceries at the Commissary. They need an ID
card for that.

They are going to shop for other things at the BX/PX. Most of these
require ID cards at checkout.

They may want to use the base amenities (gym, pool, auto care, etc). All
require ID.

Basically, anything you do on base will require ID.

Now, let's say you're a military member but you're independently wealthy
and you can get your own health insurance and you live off-base and you
don't need to access the base for anything. Your dependents don't
technically need to get their own ID cards. They'll still be registered
in DEERS as dependents, but whether or not they get ID cards is, at that
point, up to them.
