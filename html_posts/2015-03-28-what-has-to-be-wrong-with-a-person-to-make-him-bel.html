- Natural born citizen
- At least 35 years old
- Has inhabited the United States for at least 14 years.

that is, be sure to let us know.\

People try to say that candidates somehow are not \"qualified\" to be
President, when the only qualifications for office are the ones listed

Being a good leader is really all that\'s needed to be a good President.
You don\'t have to know everything, but you do need to know enough to
have a good staff, listen to them when they advise you, and overrule
them when they go off track. The leader sets the vision, the staff sets
the policy.
