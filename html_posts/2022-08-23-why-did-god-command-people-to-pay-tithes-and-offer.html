This confusion is common. The Bible separates out the two types of
giving: giving to the government (which is always mandatory) and giving
to the church (which is always voluntary).

Except in the case of Israel, which at that time was a
[[theocracy](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f98387&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theocracy){.external_link

at the time was *both the government and the church.* So sometimes,
modern day Christians confuse the giving which was required to run the
government, and the giving of your heart to the church, *because they
both went to the same place.*

The Levitical priests acted as civil government, so the giving of the
tithe (see Leviticus 27:30--33) was what we would consider today to be
income tax. Deuteronomy 14:22--29 also details a second tithe to fund a
national festival. This was more than what we would consider to be a
religious tithe (10% of a person's income); it was actually well above
20%. But all of that money was paid to the "government" to run the
country.

Any giving *above that* was to the church and was totally voluntary (see
Exodus 25:2 and 1 Chronicles 29:9). People would give whatever was in
their heart to give. This giving was never specified by the church.

Interestingly, in the United States, we pay on average between 20 and
30% of our income in taxes, which is very similar to what the Israelites
paid to their theocratic government during that time.
