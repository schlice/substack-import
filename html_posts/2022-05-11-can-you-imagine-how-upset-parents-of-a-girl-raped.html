Can you imagine how unfair it is to kill the victim of a crime instead
of the perpetrator?

Since we're talking about the less than 1% of abortion cases, let's do
that.

For the states which make no exceptions for rape or incest (of which
there are only a handful), *why do you think it's okay to kill a baby
who is just as much an innocent victim of the crime as the girl?*

To be fair, I think state laws should have exceptions for rape and
incest, but I'm not the state. I'm not going to defend what a state
legislature decides, I'll leave that to them to defend. But I just
wanted to remind you that the baby is as much an innocent victim as the
girl is. The baby's life is no less valuable because it was the product
of a rape. Rape doesn't change the girl's value as a person, does it? Is
her life worth less because she was raped? Of course not. *So why is the
baby's?*

Just something to think about when you demand to kill the baby because
the father didn't get permission to have sex.

> Is it fair to be in a position of spending thousands to get an out of

No, it is not. This is what civil court is for. Civil lawsuits are
designed to make you whole again, and they do that through *financial
compensation*.

So in this case, you spend thousands to go out of state to get an
abortion, and when you come back, you sue the rapist for pain and
suffering, as well as to reimburse you the costs of the abortion trip,
if you decide to abort the baby (see the first point above).

I added that last part because, at last survey, almost 50% of women who
were raped and became pregnant *decided to keep their babies*. So it's
not universal that *every* rape victim wants to abort their babies.

You must be on guard for the logical fallacy of going to the extreme to
avoid the middle. Yes, a situation like this would be tragic. **But what
drives policy? The extreme corner case, or the vast majority of cases?**
We don't discount the extreme cases, but they don't drive policy,
either.

Can you imagine how upset parents of a girl raped and forced to have a
baby would be? Is it fair to be in a position of spending thousands to
get an out of state abortion?
