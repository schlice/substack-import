First of all, the answer, as with all legal answers, is "it depends,"
and one of the things it depends on is whether or not the "traffic
citations" we're talking about *crimes.* If you are actually going to
court for something like a *misdemeanor or felony traffic violation*
\[i.e. reckless driving (with property damage), hit and run (with
property damage), expired or no valid driver\'s license or registration,
or DUI\], then you will be required to appear, which means you'll have
to make your way back to Florida.

But if it's literally just a traffic citation, you definitely have a few
options instead of physically going to court:

1.  Pay the ticket. You can essentially admit guilt and pay the ticket
    and you won't need to go to court. Keep in mind that this can have
    consequences on your insurance, and if you have a number of tickets
    within a short amount of time, you could risk having your license
    suspended.
2.  You can hire an attorney to go to court on your behalf.

Hiring an attorney might, at first, seem like a bad deal, because the
cost of hiring an attorney may be just as much (maybe even more) than
the cost of just paying the ticket. But there are some distinct
advantages, besides just having the attorney appear on your behalf:

- In most states, and in most cases, if the ticket is related to an
  accident you caused (where there is no bodily damage, like, let's say,
  you rear-ended a car), when your attorney shows that your insurance
  company fully accepted responsibility to pay for the other driver's
  car, they can get the ticket dismissed.
- In some cases, the attorney can negotiate on your behalf. While there
  isn't much room for negotiations in traffic court, there is *some*.
  For example, your attorney could help you avoid points on your license
  by negotiating a moving violation down to a non-moving violation.
- If you have an advanced driver's license (like a CDL), certain moving
  violations can cause you to lose your CDL. In that case, hiring an
  attorney (even if it is just as expensive, if not more, than just
  paying the ticket) could be extremely beneficial.
