You can't get arrested in the US for calling a cop fat.

What you *will get* is a lot of attention from the police that you
probably didn't want in the first place.

And they may find something that they *can* write you a ticket on, which
will piss you off more than the cop's weight.

So unless you like irritating yourself, I'd keep the comments to a
minimum around the cops.
