*I was under the impression that automatic weapons and assault rifles
were used in mass shootings.*

Nope. Very few people have actual automatic weapons. They are very rare
and difficult to come by. I can\'t remember a mass shooting that used an
automatic weapon. \"Assault weapons\" are a category of gun identified
by scary-looking attachments like pistol grips, Change the grip and the
stock and the weapon suddenly becomes **not** an assault weapon. It
fires the same round, at the same velocity, with the same accuracy, and
the same capacity. But because it has a wooden stock and foregrip, it\'s
suddenly no longer an assault weapon? Ridiculous term invented by the
media and the anti-gun lobby.

*Gun control in Australia has led to a 100% decrease in mass shootings.*

Don\'t let the facts get in the way of your rhetoric, though. While some
of the mass murders since the gun ban have used the new favorite murder
method in Australia (arson), there have been no fewer than TEN mass
murders in Australia since the gun ban, most committed with \...wait for
it\... guns.

*The constitution is there to serve the people, not the other way round.
It can be, and has been, amended. It is not some piece of holy writ
handed by God.*

Very true. However, our rights **did**, in fact, come from God. It\'s in
the Declaration of Independence

\"\...they have been endowed by their Creator \[that\'s God\] with
certain inalienable rights, among these are the right to life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness.\"

The Constitution actually just prevents government from infringing my
rights, which I already had. Government can\'t ever really take my
rights away. The Constitution, therefore, is the barrier that prevents
government from infringing on my rights.
