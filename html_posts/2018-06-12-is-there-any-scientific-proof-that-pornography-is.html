**Is there any scientific proof that pornography is bad for the human
brain, or can objections only be made from an ethical perspective? Does
this differ for children\'s brain development?**

Pornography is not "bad for the human brain" in that viewing it will
cause the brain to fail to grow properly or to fail to process, in
either the adult or child brain. So physically, pornography will not
"hurt" you.

That said, viewing pornography does cause psychological changes. I'm not
sure you would call that "harm" to the brain physiologically, but it can
objectively cause "harm" to the habitual user. I have included citations
to all of the relevant research. Some of these findings have already
been presented to Congress.

So while viewing pornography does not physically "hurt" you, that does
not mean that there isn't a risk of objective harm to the user.

These are not moral or religious objections; they are psychological
objections, as pornography abuse can produce undesirable effects on the
user. There are no statistics to show how many users are affected. It's
clear that everyone is affected differently (i.e. it's clear that not
everyone will be affected in these ways), but it is just as clear that
some may tend toward these outcomes.
