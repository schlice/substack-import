**Content:** [Only if your agency carries TASERs. Assuming your do, you
have to take the ride to get qualified to carry the TASER.\
\
Law Enforcement functions in military police units may or may not carry
a TASER. Security Police functions (resource and asset protection) will
likely not carry TASERs. For them, there is one level of force. You can
either follow directions or deadly force is authorized. Don\'t expect to
be TASERed if you cross a boundary on a flight line with nuclear
armaments and ignore police directives.]{.rendered_qtext}
