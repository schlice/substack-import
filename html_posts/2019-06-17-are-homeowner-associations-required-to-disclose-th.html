**Are homeowner associations required to disclose the books to the
home/condo owners?**

Yes, residents have the ability to review the accounting statements at
any time, and usually accounting summaries are distributed to homeowners
during the Annual Meeting.

Contact your HOA's Managing Agent to schedule a time to visit their
office to review their accounting statements if you so choose.
