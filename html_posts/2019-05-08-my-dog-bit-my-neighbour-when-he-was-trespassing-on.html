**My dog bit my neighbour when he was trespassing on my property. Am I
legally liable for paying his medical bills?**

There are a lot of factors to consider in a case like this.

For example, what does "trespassing" mean? If you invite me over your
house and I wander into an area in which I wasn't given permission to
enter, I'm technically "trespassing." If I'm in a convenience store and
I wander into an "Employees Only" area searching for an employee, I am
technically "trespassing."

The upshot of this is that *the fact that someone is trespassing does
not alleviate the owner of the responsibility to address known hazards.*

For example, if the dog is a known biter, leaving the dog alone in the
yard opens the homeowner up to liability if someone gets bitten. What if
a kid wandered in the yard? What if he was chasing a ball into the yard?
Technically, the kid was trespassing.

Again, not to split hairs, but you still wouldn't be responsible to "pay
his medical bills." He would pay his own medical bills, and then file a
negligence lawsuit against you, alleging that you were negligent when
you failed to properly secure your dog who was known to bite. He'd
attempt to recover his medical costs, as well as other damages.
