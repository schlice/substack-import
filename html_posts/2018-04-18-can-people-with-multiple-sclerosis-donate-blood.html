**Can people with multiple sclerosis donate blood?**

(US Answer Only)

Until recently, people with MS could not donate blood. However, since it
has been proven that MS is not contagious and cannot be transmitted by
blood, MS patients can now donate blood. As of May, 2007, as long as all
other conditions for donating blood are met, MS patients are permitted
to donate blood.

Most medications do not disqualify you from donating blood. However, if
you were taking (or are taking) Aubagio for your MS treatment, you are
ineligible to donate blood, and cannot donate for two years after you
stop treatment. This is likely because the active ingredient in Aubagio,
teriflunomide, can cause liver failure.
