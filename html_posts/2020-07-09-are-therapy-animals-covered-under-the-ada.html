**Are therapy animals covered under the ADA?**

**No, they are not.**

Only **service animals** are covered by the ADA. Service animals are
defined as any dog which is individually trained to do work or perform
tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability, including a
physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental
disability.

Other species of animals, whether wild or domestic, trained or
untrained, are not considered service animals. Therefore, therapy
animals are not considered service animals and are not covered by ADA.

Businesses can choose whether or not they will allow you entrance with a
therapy animal.
