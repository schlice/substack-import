The infusion room is generally pretty quiet, filled with a bunch of
La-Z-Boy (or equivalent) reclining armchairs. They're big, comfy chairs
that the patient will sit in while they are being infused. The nurse
will set you both up in the room, and she'll check you in, and then
she'll place a central line into (usually) the veins on the back of one
of his hands. Then she'll go off and retrieve the medication from secure
storage (it's expensive and can only be administered to the people who
are prescribed to get it). When she returns, she'll hang the bag on the
infuser, type in the infusion rate, and start the infusion.

And that's about as exciting as it gets. You can read, talk (quietly,
there are usually others in the infusion room receiving infusions as
well), eat, or otherwise just relax. When it's done, they'll usually
make you wait for a short time to observe for any reactions, but then
you're off.

The medication will determine exactly how long the infusion will take.
It won't be more than a few hours. It's a pretty underwhelming
experience, to be honest.
