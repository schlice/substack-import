There's a lot of things which are Biblical which Paul doesn't mention.

- Paul never mentioned "disciples." Does that mean that discipleship
  died out with the last of the apostles? Did Paul not believe in
  discipleship?
- Paul never mentioned "hell" a single time in his writings. Does this
  mean that Paul didn't believe in hell?

This is a logical fallacy called the "argument from silence." It claims
that because something is not mentioned, it must not exist. If that's
the case, then the entire Christian notion of the Trinity is called into
question, because nowhere in the Bible is the Trinity mentioned. But
just because you can't find the word "trinity" in the Bible doesn't mean
that the truth of the Trinity is not reality, or that it is not
discussed at all.

So back to the question at hand. Just because Paul didn't mention
confession of sins does not mean that it is unbiblical or that it
doesn't apply to us. This isn't the Bible of Paul; this is the Bible of
God. Paul is just one writer of forty who contributed inspired works to
the Bible.

There are plenty of other places where confession of sins is mentioned:

> *"Whoever conceals their sins does not prosper, but the one who
> confesses and renounces them finds mercy." --- Proverbs 28:13 NIV*
>
> *"Then I acknowledged my sin to you and did not cover up my iniquity.
> I said, "I will confess my transgressions to the Lord." And you
> forgave the guilt of my sin." --- Psalm 32:5 NIV*

And lest you say, "Well, that's in the Old Testament, it doesn't apply
to us," it was actually Paul who said that the Old Testament is God's
word:

> *"All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for
> reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; --- 2 Timothy
> 3:16 NASB*
>
> *For whatever was written in former days was written for our
> instruction, that through endurance and through the encouragement of
> the Scriptures we might have hope. --- Romans 15:4 ESV*

Paul is referring to the Old Testament here, since the New Testament
wasn't even written at the time he was writing his letters to Timothy or
the Romans. And everything in the Old Testament that is not abrogated or
superseded by the New Testament is authoritative as a rule of faith and
applies as much as the New Testament to Christians.

\

It's a dangerous road to travel when you look at the fact that Paul
never mentioned confession of sins, and then use that silence as
authoritative. Paul, in fact, was very clear that if believers did not
deal with certain sins, especially sexual or adulterous sin, they would
never inherit the Kingdom of God.

> *Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of
> God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters
> nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men nor thieves nor the
> greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the
> kingdom of God." --- 1 Cor 6:9--10 NIV*
>
> *"The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and
> debauchery; idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits
> of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions and envy;
> drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that
> those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God." ---
> Galatians 5:19--21 NIV*
>
> *For of this you can be sure: No immoral, impure or greedy person --
> such a person is an idolater -- has any inheritance in the kingdom of
> Christ and of God. Let no one deceive you with empty words, for
> because of such things God's wrath comes on those who are
> disobedient." --- Ephesians 5:5--6 NIV*

Be careful not to fall into the false view that both Paul and the
scriptures take sin lightly, that sin does not need to be confessed at
all, and any sin (including the sin of visiting prostitutes) can just be
"settled" by assuring them about their position of righteousness in
Christ. The danger is that believers could potentially be careless and
flippant about how they treat sins in their lives, and that may
eventually lead them to hell. It could also lead believers to the false
notion that they can continue to sin indefinitely, because they are
certain that the cross absolved them of any sins which they knowingly
commit. That's the deadly deception of this notion that many have fallen
into.

Do you think Paul taught about those sins which could disqualify
believers from entering heaven in 1 Corinthians 6:9-10, Ephesians 5:5-6
and Galatians 5:19-21, and then didn't give them a chance to confess and
repent? I don't think so. Every sin, even the most heinous, can be
repented of and be forgiven by God. That is the true grace of God.

Paul is effectively warning believers in the three passages above to
turn back to God by confessing and repenting of their sins to obtain
God's forgiveness in order to not be excluded from heaven. In other
words, **confession of sins was presupposed to be necessary to Paul**,
even though he did not explicitly mention it.

We can also, therefore, assume that Paul taught on the confession of
sins, even though it wasn't recorded in his letters.
