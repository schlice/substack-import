**Can you pray to hear from God for guidance, and then open up the Bible
to a \"random\" page to receive His voice? Not for the future as would
be a form of divination, but just to receive His voice in a more direct
way. Or would that be false prophecy?**

Let me answer you by asking a question: Who are you to tell God how you
want to receive his guidance?

*I want an answer, and I want it on God's letterhead, in Old English
font, double-spaced, 12-point.*

In case you missed the sarcasm, God doesn't work that way.

You can pray for guidance. You can pray for wisdom. You can pray that
God answers your prayers (if it is his will to do so).

Separately, you can open up the Bible to a random section ***with an
open heart and an open mind*** and let God's word speak to you. Before
you do that, I would pray to have God do just that: open my heart and
open my mind to teach me more about him. Ask God to give you wisdom and
understanding, *and then open the Bible and read.*

A good way to do that is what we call **SOAPing.** You pick a chapter
from the Bible, and you read it. Alternatively, you can use any of the
"X-day Bible Reading Plans" that are freely available on the Internet.
Personally, I would highly recommend
[[YouVersion](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=89cdcd&url=https://www.bible.com/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="bible.com"}]{.qlink_container}, available on the Web and on
your favorite mobile device. Pray first for God to open your mind and
your heart and teach you through your reading, then read the chapter.
Next, do a SOAP analysis. As you can probably guess, SOAP is an acronym.
It stands for **S**cripture, **O**bersvation, **A**pplication, and
**P**rayer. Scripture means that you pick out a verse or two which stood
out to you while you were reading. You then make an Observation about
that verse. You Apply that passage to you, your life, or your
circumstances, and then you Pray for God to help you in that endeavor.

For context, I'll give you an example out of my SOAP diary (I keep it
online for easy access on any device). This was a time when I was
SOAPing through the Bible and I read John 1. Here's what I got:

> **S**cripture
>
> There was a man sent from God whose name was John. He came as a
> witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all
> might believe. He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness
> to the light. (John‬ 1‬:6-8‬ NIV)
>
> **O**bservation
>
> I love how God sends \"the Light,\" but He also sends messengers to
> testify about the light. I can only imagine that those messengers
> appeared crazy to the people, especially when John said things like
> "Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! This is
> the one I meant when I said, 'A man who comes after me has surpassed
> me because he was before me.'\" (John‬ 1‬:29-30‬ NIV). What more can He
> do to try to tell us the Good News?
>
> **A**pplication
>
> God sends me messages all the time. I need to do a better job at
> receiving them.
>
> **P**rayer
>
> God, please help me to \"get it.\" Because I don\'t often get it. You
> keep calling and I don\'t hear. Help me to know Your voice so I may
> better separate You from the noise.

SOAPing through the Bible is a great way to both read the Bible, and at
the same time, put yourself in a frame of mind to receive the message
that God is trying to deliver through it. Have you SOAPed today? Ha, a
little Bible humor...

But back to the question, asking for something and expecting an answer
by opening the Bible is just another way of you demanding that God
answer you, in the way you expect. We are in no position to demand
anything from God. And God doesn't work that way.
