What I think is valid and what someone else thinks is valid are two
different things. Validity isn't determined by truth these days; it's
determined by opinion.

However, we can talk about facts and then you can determine for yourself
whether or not what some people think about vaccines is "valid."

This is accurate as of today (9 Jan 2022) for the United States
according to the
[[CDC](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2fb4c4&url=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/about-covid-19.html){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="cdc.gov"}]{.qlink_container}, but as you know, in the face
of a rapidly changing viral landscape, this can change again. Always get
the most current guidance for your country and the time you're reading
this.

\

**Boosters.** The COVID-19 vaccines need booster shots because of the
fact that public health officials monitoring the vaccinated population
are seeing **reduced protection over time**. This means the longer it
has been since your vaccine, the less effective it has been shown to be
against mild and moderate illness. Does this mean that the vaccines are
*worthless*? I don't think so. I still think that even reduced
protection, or protection that must be boosted with another shot, is
still better than no protection at all, when it comes to illness from
the virus.

These next two points in this question relate specifically to Omicron
and how it has changed the landscape. Personally, I'm really happy for
Omicron. It's going to give a lot more people a more durable immunity,
but it's just going to do it the hard way. Oh well, *c'est la vie.*

> *and the need to get tested if exposed to someone with COVID-19,*

**Testing**. The guidance on testing has changed in the wake of Omicron.
If you have been exposed to someone who has tested positive for
COVID-19, you need to self-isolate for five days from the date of your
exposure. The day you were exposed is Day 0. At the end of your five-day
quarantine, if you haven't developed any symptoms (fever, body aches,
chills), it is recommended that you self-test. You can use any test
provided by your state or locality at a community testing site, any
private healthcare facility testing, or any over-the-counter at-home
rapid test to test yourself, but this step isn't totally necessary, and
may be omitted if you do not have access to at-home test kits (which are
extremely hard to come by these days). If you are negative (or
symptom-free), you can leave your home. It is recommended by the CDC to
wear a mask in public until 10 days after your exposure. **This is the
only time that masks make sense.** Wear a good N-95 mask and make sure
it fits you well. This protects others. Continue to wear a mask in
public until 10 days after your exposure.

> *the fact that some fully vaccinated people got infected?*

**Infection with Omicron.** Omicron is the variant that proves the rule.
The rule has always been that fully vaccinated people can still contract
COVID-19 and can still pass it on to others. It just didn't happen very
often with OG COVID, or with variants like Delta.

But Omicron is a horse of a different color. Omicron is both **highly
virulent** and **less severe** than any of its compatriots. Omicron is
so highly virulent that it is infecting both fully vaccinated and
unvaccinated people equally. Some say that it is infecting fully
vaccinated people more, others say that it is infecting unvaccinated
people more, these numbers are specious and fraught. We know that
Omicron doesn't care whether or not you are vaccinated; it infects you
all the same.

**The good news** is that it is less severe than other variants. It does
not cause the debilitating respiratory illnesses that land others in the
ICU. It causes upper respiratory symptoms similar to those of influenza.
In other words, it burns through quickly, it can be ridden out at home,
and then you're done.

**The even gooder news** is that once you've had it, you now have
*immunity*, and testing is showing that cross-immunity to other variants
is present in those who contracted Omicron and recovered. Don't listen
to the hogwash about "having the virus doesn't give you immunity."
That's utter nonsense and flies in the face of virology. The truth is
that it's a virus and it behaves like any other virus. Once you've had
it, you have immunity. Durable, long-lasting, cross-variant immunity.
And ultimately, that's good news for everyone, because ***this*** is
what will slow the spread of the virus. The actual term is "herd
immunity," but that term seems to have received some negative press
recently, so we'll just say "it's a good thing."

Original question:

Is it valid that some people think that the COVID-19 vaccines are
worthless because of the need for a booster shots, and the need to get
tested if exposed to someone with COVID-19, the fact that some fully
vaccinated people got infected?
