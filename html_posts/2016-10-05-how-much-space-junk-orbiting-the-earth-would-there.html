I always hesitate to add anything to an answer that [[Robert
Frost](https://www.quora.com/profile/Robert-Frost-1)]{.qlink_container}
has already answered, because it's hard to add any credibility after
him, but I do have one relevant piece of information.

I worked in NORAD.

Why, perchance, is that relevant?

As part of NORAD's Space Control mission, the Space crew maintains the
SCAT (that's pronounced "S - Cat", not "scat") The SCAT is the "space
catalog" which contains tens of thousands of pieces of cataloged space
junk down to the size of a baseball. We regularly maintain the SCAT by
ensuring the pieces of space junk are in their correct orbits and we
know where they are (i.e. their orbits have not changed significantly,
and have not decayed).

We have the SCAT in a big database which can actually be represented
graphically (not to scale, of course). It's actually quite beautiful
when represented that way.

When the Shuttle was flying (when I was there, it was), we would insert
the shuttle's actual flight path into the database, draw a 10 meter
"box" around the shuttle, and fly it forward in time, about 36 hours
forward to be precise. We would then have the computer tell us if there
was to be any "convergence" between the box and any debris in the SCAT.
If there was, we'd call whoever was controlling that Shuttle mission and
advise them of the convergence. I know that our input has prompted
several course corrections during the course of the Shuttle program.

I would not be surprised in the least if we do the same thing with the
ISS today.
