False equivalence. You simply cannot compare humans and animals. Humans
have self awareness and agency, which animals do not. As good caretakers
of animals, we know when they are in pain, and if we cannot help them,
we have a duty and a responsibility to alleviate their suffering.

When it comes to euthanasia and humans, there are several reasons it is
"not considered okay."

- Religious people will tell you that life is a gift of God, and that
  only God should decide when it ends, not us.
- Outside of religion, everyone everywhere knows intuitively that it is
  wrong to kill humans. They may not be able to explain why they know
  (which is a whole discussion unto itself), but they know.
- There is a moral difference between passively "letting die" and
  actively "killing." Withholding treatment equates to letting die
  (passive) and is at least justifiable, whereas physician-assisted
  suicide equates to killing (active) and is less easily justifiable.
- Some people fear that if euthanasia was legalized, it would be abused,
  and some people would be killed who didn't want to die. But public
  opinion is changing, and people are increasingly in favor of allowing
  terminally ill patients the right to die with a doctor's help.
- Doctors are generally not in favor of the practice, saying that
  associating euthanasia with medicine could harm the public's image of
  the profession. And doctors are not perfect either. Doctors make
  mistakes. But forcing multiple doctors to make independent terminality
  diagnoses should alleviate some of that concern.
