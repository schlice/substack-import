**Since some security companies require you to be tased or pepper
sprayed before being allowed to carry those tools, why don\'t they
require the same for a firearm?**

Let's start with the obvious: **Requiring you to be pepper sprayed or
tased is stupid.**

There is no manufacturer requirement that you have to feel what it feels
like before you can be certified to carry it.

They only do it (police departments included) for one of two reasons:

- It's a rite of passage
- They want you to understand what you might be inflicting on others, so
  that you don't do so willy-nilly simply because it is non-lethal force

It doesn't "enhance the training" or do anything else of the sort. It
doesn't make the training more "relatable" or anything else. Otherwise,
you could, as the OP did, apply the same logic to the firearm.

However, you cannot do the same with a firearm because it is lethal
force, any time it is used. Where can you be shot that you can guarantee
will not kill you?
