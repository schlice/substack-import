Everyone else seems to compare guns to people, imparting some kind of
magical mind control that the gun has over people, turning *them* into
killing machines. In fact, these same people see the mere presence of a
gun as somehow changing people, making them kill when previously they
wouldn't.

The gun is simply a tool. It is a tool to kill. In that sense, it is a
"killing machine." Killing may be distasteful to you (as it is to most
normally-adjusted people), but killing can also be legally and morally
justified. If you are in a situation where killing can be justified, why
would you not use the best tool for the job? Guns are arguably the most
efficient tool available to take a life while simultaneously not
affecting people standing right next to the intended target. It is a
very precise, high-velocity method to impart deadly force. Ultimately,
that's all it is. ***On its own***, it does nothing. Not a single one of
my guns has ever gotten up and killed anyone. The gun requires a
**person** imparting the will to take a life to operate it and cause
death. The addition of the person makes the gun a killing machine.
Alone, it does nothing.

Knives were originally designed as "killing machines" as well, but they
found far more utility as cutting tools. They are still used as killing
machines, and in far greater numbers than guns. In fact, most domestic
violence cases involve knives. Do you have the same dislike for kitchen
knives? Or has their perceived utility in your mind overcome the fact
that they were, and still are, quite efficient killing machines?

Cars were never designed as killing machines, but they are indeed just
that. Cars kill more people than guns and knives combined. But because
cars have such incredible utility in transportation, we ignore
completely that they are killing machines. The only difference between a
car and a gun is that the car was not designed as a killing machine.

I just want you to evaluate your dislike and understand it for what it
is. Your dislike is *your* issue, not the gun's, or the knife's. It's
something you must own. And like the knife, if you start to see the
utility in the gun as a tool of self-defense, you can overcome your
dislike of it in the same way you have overcome your dislike of the
knife as a killing machine.
