**Is there unbiased data to support the areas with gun ownership have
less rapes and muggings (proving that guns are an effective deterrent)
than areas with no/low gun ownership?**

There is *unbiased* data, but if we're doing intellectual data research,
we don't use it because there is weak to no *correlation* between rates
of gun ownership and rates of crimes against the person. Therefore, it
makes no *logical sense* to try to compare gun ownership to crimes
against the person.

At best, the statistics you should be looking at are rates of issuance
of CCW permits vs rates of crimes against the person. However, I don't
know of anywhere that those statistics exist.
