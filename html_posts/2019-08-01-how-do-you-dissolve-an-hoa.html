**How can a home owner's association (HOA) be disbanded?**

I know I've answered this before but I can't seem to find it.

Most HOAs typically need anywhere from 85 to 100% of the current
homeowners to agree to disband it. State law determines what is required
in your state. All required homeowners will have to sign an official
legal document expressing their approval of the disbanding.

You will also need to hire a real estate attorney to assist with the
transaction, as there is usually community property which will need to
be disposed of, and utilities and general liability insurance which will
need to be paid by someone. There are also filing fees with the city
which will need to be paid. Often, there are charitable organizations
who will take over the community property; your attorney can help put
you in touch with them. The city must also approve, and any back taxes
will need to be paid.

Once all the community property is disposed of and agreements have been
made about paying for insurance and utilities, and all homeowners agree,
the lawyer helps you execute the document and files with the city.
