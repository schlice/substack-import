According to [[Johns Hopkins
Medicine](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=739495&url=http://hopkinsmedicine.org){.external_link

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"

treatment for venous malformation is **embolization*.*** Embolization is
a procedure whereby alcohol is injected into the venous blood sac or
lymph sac until the sacs collapse and no longer fill.

The treatment can be performed in one day, but normally requires several
treatments about six weeks apart to block all of the abnormal blood
vessels. It is quite effective, but needs to be monitored as changes in
the body can cause new arterial branches to form, which might require
re-treatment.
