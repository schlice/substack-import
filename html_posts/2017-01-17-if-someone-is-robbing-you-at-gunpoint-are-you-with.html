In order to use lethal force against a person, you must be in fear for
your life.

I would speculate that someone who has a gun pointed at them probably
fears for his life at that very moment. This means that the use of
deadly force would be justified.

It's for this reason that they have created this little gem:

The gun wallet.

This is a Ruger LCP in a gun wallet. Inside your pocket, it "prints"
like a wallet, not like a gun. That means the outline of the object in
your pocket looks like a wallet. The bad guy has no reason to suspect
that you're actually drawing a gun, not a wallet.

For the person who gets drawn on and when that suspect demands money,
drawing this instead might save your life. I'd be firing this and
running for cover at the same time.
