**Are bright flashlights illegal?**

*(US answer only)*

No, bright flashlights in and of themselves are not illegal, in just the
same way that owning a gun (if you are not a prohibited person) is also
not illegal.

How you *use them* may be.

If you intentionally shine a bright flashlight into someone's eyes in
order to blind them, this could be considered *assault*.

In most areas where you can hunt, shining a bright light in a deer's
eyes to disorient them and then shooting them is considered poaching,
and is also illegal.
