You are free to pray to God for whatever you want. He doesn't have to
give it to you.

So let's look at what you are praying for, and let's see if God will
answer you.

You are praying for God to abolish evil. As other answerers have said,
Revelations explains that when the day of judgement comes, Satan will be
cast into the lake of fire. In other words, he's already going to
abolish evil.

But what about today? Why doesn't God just wipe away all of the evil
today? Right now? There's so much pain and suffering and outright evil
in the world. Why can't we pray for God to just come down and eliminate
all the evil?

The answer may surprise you.

*He's not going to eliminate part of his creation.*

Evil has a time limit, an expiration date. Once the day of judgement
comes, evil will be vanquished. *But until then, evil is*
***permitted*** *to operate.*

Look at Job 1:6--12. It helps to explain how God allows evil:

> Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves
> before the Lord, and Satan also came among them. The Lord said to
> Satan, "From where do you come?" Then Satan answered the Lord and
> said, "From roaming about on the earth and walking around on it." The
> Lord said to Satan, "Have you considered My servant Job? For there is
> no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, fearing God
> and turning away from evil." Then Satan answered the Lord, "Does Job
> fear God for nothing? Have You not made a hedge about him and his
> house and all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of
> his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land. But put
> forth Your hand now and touch all that he has; he will surely curse
> You to Your face." Then the Lord said to Satan, "Behold, all that he
> has is in your power, only do not put forth your hand on him." So
> Satan departed from the presence of the Lord. --- Job 1:6--12 NASB1995

Note that God gave Satan permission to torment Job. As the story
continues, Satan did this, and Job was placed into extreme agony and
torture, but was not killed (as God commanded). **Through it all, Job
remained faithful**.

Now look at Joseph. His entire life was in shambles. He was hated by his
brothers who considered killing him before agreeing instead to sell him
as a slave. While in Egypt, he was imprisoned, falsely accused by
Potiphar's wife of attempted rape, and threatened with execution. There
is no indication that God explained to Joseph what He was doing through
those many years of heartache or how the pieces would eventually fit
together. Nevertheless, throughout all of his trouble, **Joseph remained
faithful.**

There's a lesson to be learned here. And that lesson is not to hope that
evil will be vanquished in our lifetime. The lesson of Job and Joseph is
this: **God is pleased with us when we are faithful** ***despite the
evil.*** **Our faithfulness to God is pleasing to him** ***even when
nothing makes sense.***

So perhaps a better prayer would be to ask God to keep us faithful
*despite* the evil. Perhaps God can help us to remain strong *in the
face of evil*. Perhaps we can learn to rely on God instead of "leaning
on our own understanding" (Proverbs 3:5).

I would also pray that those who are affected by evil could also hear
this message and learn to trust God, and know that God allows these
things to happen because he has a plan for us, and his plans are always
good, and we don't always know what those plans are. God doesn't always
explain to us why we are experiencing bad times. But we rely on the fact
that God has a plan, and it is good.

That, to me, is likely to be a more effective prayer.
