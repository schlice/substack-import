There are a few ways, but the two biggest, in my opinion:

- Eliminate the Electoral College from the Constitution.
- Propose national election laws (in violation of the Constitution)
  regulating state elections.

The Electoral College makes it much more difficult to rig an election,
because you can't rig just one election; you have to rig a number of
state elections in order to make a significant enough difference to
influence the overall outcome of the election. Remember, there's not one
Presidential election, there are 51 separate elections (all 50 states
and the District of Columbia). The Electoral College process means that
small election anomalies in one area of the country won't affect the
overall outcome of the election. With the Electoral College in place,
you have to affect many swing state votes in order to change the outcome
of the election. Without it (i.e. with a purely popular vote), *any*
votes stolen in *any* precinct of the country could affect the national
outcome.

But swing states change all the time. Not every state which was a swing
state is still so today. If nothing else, safe and swing states are
constantly changing. California voted safely Republican as recently as
1988. Texas used to vote Democrat. Neither New Hampshire nor Virginia
used to be swing states. Most people think that George W. Bush won the
2000 election because of Florida. It certainly was a big factor, but he
really won the election because he managed to flip one state which the
Democrats thought was safe: West Virginia. Its 4 electoral votes turned
out to be decisive.

We also saw vast changes to state elections during the pandemic, when
security rules surrounding how ballots were sent, received, and counted,
were relaxed. Because this happened to broad swaths of the country, it
is at least conceivable that the national changes in election laws may
have impacted the outcome of the election. Returning election laws to
pre-COVID rules, or even tightening election security, would greatly
benefit the entire country by ensuring that elections are indeed secure.
Most states have fixed their election laws, and returned them to
pre-COVID standards, or better.
