**What effect will the new US "Conscience Rules" have on the ability of
Americans to obtain emergency care and treatment when health care
professionals interject personal/religious moral objections?**

It will have no effect whatsoever.

We have already had a long history of conscience protections as well as
anti-discrimination statutes in this country. For example:

- Conscience protections related to abortion, sterilization, and certain
  other health services applicable to the Department of Health and Human
  Services and recipients of certain Federal funds encompassed by 42
  U.S.C. 300a--7 (the "Church Amendments");
- Conscience protections for health care entities related to abortion
  provision or training, referral for such abortion or training, or
  accreditation standards related to abortion (the "Coats‐Snowe
  Amendment," 42 U.S.C. 238n)
- Protections from discrimination for health care entities that do not
  provide, pay for, provide coverage of, or refer for abortions under
  programs funded by the Department's appropriations acts (e.g.,
  Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and
  Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019, Div. B., sec. 507(d),
  Pub. L. No. 115‐245, 132 Stat. 2981 (Sept. 28, 2018) (the "Weldon
  Amendment"); id., sec. 209);
- Protections from discrimination under the Patient Protection and
  Affordable Care Act ("ACA") for health care entities that do not
  provide any health care item or service furnished for the purpose of
  causing, or for the purpose of assisting in causing, the death of any
  individual, such as by assisted suicide, euthanasia, or mercy killing,
  applicable to the Federal Government and any State or local government
  that receives Federal financial assistance (42 U.S.C. 18113); and
  conscience protections for providers, organizations, or their
  employees regarding counseling regarding the same (42 U.S.C.
  14406(1));
- Conscience protections regarding exemptions applicable to the ACA's
  individual mandate (26 U.S.C. 5000A; 42 U.S.C. 18081);
- Conscience protections under the ACA for qualified health plans
  related to coverage of abortion, and for individual health care
  providers and health care facilities that do not provide, pay for,
  provide coverage of, or refer for abortions (42 U.S.C. 18023(b)(1)(A)
  and (b)(4));
- Conscience protections for Medicare Advantage organizations and
  Medicaid managed care organizations with moral or religious objections
  to counseling or referral for certain services (42 U.S.C.
  1395w‐22(j)(3)(B) and 1396u‐2(b)(3)(B));
- Conscience protections related to the performance of advanced
  directives (42 U.S.C. 1395cc(f), 1396a(w)(3), and 14406(2));
- Conscience and nondiscrimination protections for organizations related
  to Global Health Programs, to the extent such funds are administered
  by the Secretary of HHS (the "Secretary") (22 U.S.C. 7631(d));
- Conscience protections attached to Federal funding, to the extent such
  funding is administered by the Secretary, regarding abortion and
  involuntarily sterilization (22 U.S.C. 2151b(f), see, e.g., the
  Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019, Pub. L. 116‐6, Div. F, sec.
  7018 (the "Helms, Biden, 1978, and 1985 Amendments"));
- Conscience protections from compulsory health care or services
  generally (42 U.S.C. 1396f and 5106i(a)), and under specific programs
  for hearing screening (42 U.S.C. 280g‐1(d)), occupational illness
  testing (29 U.S.C. 669(a)(5)); vaccination (42 U.S.C.
  1396s(c)(2)(B)(ii)), and mental health treatment (42 U.S.C.
  290bb‐36(f)); and
- Protections for religious nonmedical health care providers and their
  patients from certain requirements under Medicare and Medicaid that
  may burden their exercise of their religious beliefs regarding medical
  treatment (e.g., 42 U.S.C. 1320a‐1(h), 1320c‐11, 1395i‐5, 1395x(e),
  1395x(y)(1), 1396a(a), and 1397j‐1(b)).[\[1\]](#bUrNI){#cite-bUrNI

These laws already exist. The Department of Health and Human Services
has previously had in place rules which follow these Federal laws, and
they've been re-written and updated now. This is yet another re-write
and update, clarifying those same conscience protections.

The rules generally allow providers to modify their service based on the
dictates of their conscience. At the same time, it provides for a
complaint system administered by the Department's Office of Civil Rights
(OCR) when someone feels that discrimination has taken place and that a
provider may be abusing the conscience protections.

This effectively balances everyone's needs: the providers have strong
conscience protections, and patients have an avenue to seek redress if
they believe a provider is unlawfully abusing conscience protections.
