So long as your medication is legal and prescribed to you, you can bring
it with you through an airport security checkpoint. Make sure that your
medication remains in its original packaging (i.e. don\'t put it in a
pill sorter or a Ziploc baggie) with the prescription label showing that
it is prescribed to you. Even controlled substances can be transported
in this way.

Your liquid prescription medications are also not subject to the 3 oz in
1 qt bag restrictions. I used to travel heavily while I was taking
Copaxone for multiple sclerosis. Copaxone came pre-packaged in syringes,
but they were all in blister packs. I just made sure that I had my
prescription label, even though I re-boxed them in hard plastic
containers. I never removed them from the prescription blister packs. I
travelled internationally with my syringes. Never had an issue,
regardless of the country I was travelling through.
