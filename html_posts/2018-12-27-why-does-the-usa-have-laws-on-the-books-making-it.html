**Why does the USA have laws on the books making it an offence to drive
without your driving license in your physical possession? In the UK you
merely have to produce your license within 7 days at a Police station if
you are not carrying it.**

In most states in the US, there are two different laws that govern this.

The more severe law says that in order to operate a motor vehicle, you
must be in possession of a valid driver's license. This is the one that
can get you into the big trouble, and it means that you must have a
valid license before you can drive, not that you need to have it on you.
The UK is the same as the US in this regard, and while the text of the
laws differ, the intent is the same: you must have a license before you
can drive.

The less severe law says that the operator of a motor vehicle must be in
possession of his or her license at all times while they are driving,
and must surrender that license to law enforcement when it is demanded.
The reason why they do this is because it simply makes it easier on the
officer effecting the traffic stop. With the quantity of stops they must
make, having to research the license status of every driver they stop
unnecessarily extends the time of the stop and taxes the already thin
resources of the department. If you are interested in extending your
traffic stop because you just love being stopped by the police, don't
bother carrying your license with you when you drive. That said,
violating this law is, in most states, a petty offense; however, the law
specifically says a driver can't be *convicted* if they produce in court
satisfactory evidence that a drivers license was actually issued and was
valid at the time of the offense. So you can be ticketed for this
offense but it can be dismissed by the court if you produce your license
and show that it was valid on the day you were stopped. This is called a
*dismissible offense*. It's still a hassle, so if you like longer
traffic stops *and* you like going to the courthouse to visit the clerk
of the court just to get your ticket dismissed (minus fees), then you
also don't have to carry your license with you when you drive.

Again, this varies by state, but is relatively standard across the US.
