**As a Christian, does it bother you that life doesn\'t seem to give you
much more than it does the non-believer?**

If it does, then you're looking at life incorrectly.

Look, I get it, because I see it every day. Evil people with hate in
their hearts win. Every day. They accumulate much more material wealth
than I do. They have beautiful homes, nice cars, and generally easy
lives. And I struggle, daily. I struggle with my vices. I struggle with
my finances. And I struggle to keep my family moving forward towards God
in a sea of sin.

But part of the problem is that it's an illusion. As you know, people
have a public persona that they show every day, but in private, they are
entirely different people. Some public personas are very close to their
private ones, and some are very different. I suspect that for many
worldly people, their public personas are very much different than their
private ones.

The other part of the problem is that the accumulation of treasure on
earth is folly. Jesus told the parable of the surplus grain:

> And he told them this parable: "The ground of a certain rich man
> yielded an abundant harvest. He thought to himself, 'What shall I do?
> I have no place to store my crops.'
>
> "Then he said, 'This is what I'll do. I will tear down my barns and
> build bigger ones, and there I will store my surplus grain. And I'll
> say to myself, 'You have plenty of grain laid up for many years. Take
> life easy; eat, drink and be merry.'
>
> "But God said to him, 'You fool! This very night your life will be
> demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for
> yourself?'
>
> "This is how it will be with whoever stores up things for themselves
> but is not rich toward God." --- Luke 12:16--21 NIV

On a side note, it's important to note that the man didn't do anything
to make the crops grow; God did. The man only reaped the benefits of
God's work, but the man decided to take the credit and store up God's
outpouring.

This passage goes on:

> Then Jesus said to his disciples: "Therefore I tell you, do not worry
> about your life, what you will eat; or about your body, what you will
> wear. For life is more than food, and the body more than clothes.
> Consider the ravens: They do not sow or reap, they have no storeroom
> or barn; yet God feeds them. And how much more valuable you are than
> birds! Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to your life?
> Since you cannot do this very little thing, why do you worry about the
> rest?
>
> "Consider how the wild flowers grow. They do not labor or spin. Yet I
> tell you, not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of

> Luke 12:22--31 NIV

The pagan world runs after all such things, and your Father knows that
you need them. **But seek his kingdom, and these things will be given
you as well.**

God will provide you with what you need in this life. Don't worry about
what others have. You will get what you need in this life, and you will
be rewarded in the next.

The people who are *of* this world will excel *in* this world. But when
it comes to the next, they are sorely lacking, in my opinion. I honestly
don't know, because that's between them and God. But usually, you can
tell how well someone relates to God by how well they relate to God's
children here on earth. And if their relationships with God's children
here on earth is any indication, these folks are lacking in the
"relationship with God" category.

**Jesus** **even warned us** that this would be an issue.

> If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. If you
> belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do
> not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That
> is why the world hates you. --- John 15:18--19 NIV
>
> I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In
> this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the
> world. --- John 16:33 NIV

Our job is not to adapt ourselves to this world, because we have been
chosen from the world. We are not a part of it. We are indeed a people
set apart. So don't fret about the material things of this world that
you don't have, and the life which simply doesn't compare to that of the
non-believer. Your heart is set on a *different* prize.

Don't store up your treasures on earth. Store up your treasures in
heaven, where it counts.
