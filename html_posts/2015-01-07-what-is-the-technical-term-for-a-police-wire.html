**Content:** [I assume you\'re talking about a wiretap, which is exactly
what it is called.\
\
There is no difference between a \"police wire\" or any other wiretap. A
court order is required before a line can be tapped by law enforcement.\
\
It\'s a lot less technical than it used to be. You bring the tap order
to the phone company who clicks a few buttons and records every
conversation on that phone number from then on out until the expiration
of the order.]{.rendered_qtext}
