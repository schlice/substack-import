Unfortunately, your assumption is incorrect. It is only the court that
is concerned with your innocence or guilt. The police do not adjudicate
innocence or guilt, the police only deal with preponderance of evidence.
Only a court of law in the jurisdiction in which the incident occurred
can determine whether or not you are guilty of that offense. The police
do not have any say in that determination. If the police are called as
witnesses, it is only to clarify facts in evidence.

If the police had any concern with innocence or guilt, that would make
the police judge, jury, and executioner.
