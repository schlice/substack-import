**Content:** [*Could* it be MS? Sure. It also could be something else.
You can\'t diagnose it here.\
\
If your doctor is not doing the tests you want him to do, find a doctor
who will work with you to find the right answers.\
\
What are the right answers?\
\
When you get a diagnosis, start a treatment, and your symptoms abate,
that\'s the right answer.\
\
It sounds like you had a full neuro workup and an MRI. There are other
tests which also can be done to show MS:\
]{.rendered_qtext}

- lumbar puncture (spinal tap): Usually not needed, but adds to the
  \"body of evidence\" that would indicate MS.
- evoked potential tests: You can get visual evoked potential and visual
  evoked response tests, which show the amount of time it takes a nerve
  to respond to visual stimuli.

But some things to also consider:\

- Your MRI is clear; this is a big contraindication to MS. The MRI scan
  almost invariably shows \"little white spots.\"
- MS is known as \"The Great Imitator\" because there are no symptoms of
  MS that are \"unique\" to MS. In other words, every symptom you can
  experience in MS can be experienced in some other disease. Diagnosing
  MS is a diagnosis of exclusion: you have to exclude everything else
  that could potentially cause your symptoms before you can be diagnosed
  with MS. That\'s a lot of work, and it doesn\'t sound like you\'ve
  explored all the possibilities of what else could be causing your
  symptoms.

Good luck!
