<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [*Could* it be MS? Sure. It also could be something else.<br>You can\'t diagnose it here.\<br>\<br>If your doctor is not doing the tests you want him to do, find a doctor<br>who will work with you to find the right answers.\<br>\<br>What are the right answers?\<br>\<br>When you get a diagnosis, start a treatment, and your symptoms abate,<br>that\'s the right answer.\<br>\<br>It sounds like you had a full neuro workup and an MRI. There are other<br>tests which also can be done to show MS:\<br>]<br><br>- lumbar puncture (spinal tap): Usually not needed, but adds to the<br>  \"body of evidence\" that would indicate MS.<br>- evoked potential tests: You can get visual evoked potential and visual<br>  evoked response tests, which show the amount of time it takes a nerve<br>  to respond to visual stimuli.<br><br>But some things to also consider:\<br><br>- Your MRI is clear; this is a big contraindication to MS. The MRI scan<br>  almost invariably shows \"little white spots.\"<br>- MS is known as \"The Great Imitator\" because there are no symptoms of<br>  MS that are \"unique\" to MS. In other words, every symptom you can<br>  experience in MS can be experienced in some other disease. Diagnosing<br>  MS is a diagnosis of exclusion: you have to exclude everything else<br>  that could potentially cause your symptoms before you can be diagnosed<br>  with MS. That\'s a lot of work, and it doesn\'t sound like you\'ve<br>  explored all the possibilities of what else could be causing your<br>  symptoms.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
