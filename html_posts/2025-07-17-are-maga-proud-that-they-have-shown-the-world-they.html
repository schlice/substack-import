There are so many problems with this question. Where to start...

1.  MAGA â‰  Christian. You can be a MAGA Republican and not be Christian.
    You can be Christian and Republican but not consider yourself a
    "MAGA" Republican.
2.  I can't say how many times I've said this, but Trump was never
    convicted of rape. You claim he did, but you have no evidence. No
    criminal court ever convicted Trump of rape. He was found to be
    partially liable for sexual abuse in a civil trial and was forced to
    pay money, but that's a much lower standard than a criminal trial.
    The civil court uses a "preponderance of evidence" standard, not a
    "beyond a reasonable doubt" standard.
3.  Just curious where in the Bible it says that your president must be
    sinless. The last sinless guy who walked the earth was nailed to a
    cross about 2000 years ago. So I'm just curious how voting for
    someone who has sinned (read: *everyone alive*) somehow makes you a
    "pretend Christian."
4.  What do you know about my life? Who exactly do you think you are
    that you can call me a "pretend Christian" and selfish? What do you
    know about what "Christian" acts I've done? And what, exactly, is a
    "Christian act?" I bet you're not even Christian, but you somehow
    believe it's your right to tell me how to live my Christian life.
    How utterly reprehensible and hypocritical. Should I start looking
    into your life and judging you for the choices you've made? Sadly,
    most people are really bad at the "shoe on the other foot" test.

Sheesh, the nerve of some people. The absolute, unmitigated gall.
Keyboard warriors the lot of them. Move out of your mom's basement.
