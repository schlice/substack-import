**Where can I get help/answers from lawyers or attorneys for free? I am
being accused of something I did not do and don\'t have the money for a
lawyer.**

Go to Google and look up "legal aid." You should find some legal aid in
your local area.

[[Legal
aid](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=95cc16&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_aid){.external_link

provides free legal aid to those who cannot afford it. It helps to
ensure equal protection under the law.
