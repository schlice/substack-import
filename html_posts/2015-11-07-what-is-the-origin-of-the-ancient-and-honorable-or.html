**Content:** [This is what I remember off the top of my head.\
\
It is generally assumed that all Turtles own an Ass (translation: a
donkey). To that end, if you are ever asked \"Are you a Turtle?\",
regardless of the location or situation, you are required to immediately
and proudly answer, \"You bet your sweet Ass I am!\" Failure to answer
thusly costs you one beverage of the asker\'s choosing.\
\
I know it is a sub group of the Freemasons, which were very popular in
the military. Back in my grandfather\'s day, most Naval stations had a
Freemason lodge on base.\
