*Please Note: In almost all states, any device or treatment which
obscures your license plate (and paint would be included) is*
***illegal*** *to have on your car while you\'re on the road. Check your
state rules before using any of these products. Being caught with any of
them could get you a ticket.*

Yes, there are a number of solutions that allow your license plate to be
obscured in such a way that when a camera tries to view your plate, it
is obscured.

One such tool is a variation of a Fresnel lens. When your plate is
viewed straight on, it is visible. But from a high angle (such as where
a camera would be located), the plate is obscured.

A second solution attacks the problem of red light cameras taking flash
photos of your plate. Have you ever taken a picture of a street sign?
Have you noticed how washed out the image of the sign is? Signs use a
highly-reflective gloss paint (originally created by 3M) to reflect as
much light back as possible. It\'s used in road stripe paint and signage
paint all over the world. Now imagine spraying that clear-coat
high-gloss reflective substance on your license plate, and what the
impact would be to a camera which takes flash pictures:

You can tell that the contrast was turned up in the second photo, but
still, you get the idea.

There is a third system which is more technological, and is built into a
license plate frame. It detects the flash from the camera and activates
several bright infrared LEDs around the license plate to similarly
\"blind\" the camera to the contents of your plate.
