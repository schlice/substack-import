The answer is "it depends."

You can generally leave within the first two years of Academy education
with no repercussions. You can also keep whatever college credits you
earned, fully transferable to any accepting civilian university. And so
long as you were "in good standing" while a cadet (i.e. no outstanding
disciplinary issues, etc), you should still be able to re-enlist in the
Air Force as an enlisted airman, attend civilian university and
participate in the ROTC program, or attend civilian university and go to
OTS. You can't stay in the military after leaving USAFA, but if you left
within the first two years and were in good standing, you should be able
to re-enlist.

Once you begin the first day of your third academic year (what is
referred to as your "junior year" in civilian colleges, called your
"second class" year at USAFA, as you are members of the "second class"),
you begin to accrue "Active Duty Service Commitment." This means that
*you will owe the military time (or in some cases, money¹) to repay your
education.* The amount of time you will be required to serve is
dependent on how long you remain at the Academy. If you do not graduate,
you will have to serve your commitment as an enlisted member.

TL;DR: If you leave within the first two years, you will not remain in
the military, but you can re-enlist after you leave. If you leave within
the last two years, you will be enlisted when you leave, and your active
duty service commitment will depend on how long you were at USAFA
following the first day of academics in your junior year.

\

¹ The only time you must *pay out* your time in cash is if you are, for
some reason, ineligible to serve as an enlisted member. For example, if
you were convicted of a crime and dishonorably discharged (which
includes disenrollment from USAFA), you would not be able to enlist or
re-enlist, so you would have to pay back your time in money rather than
in service. If you were disenrolled from USAFA for a USAFA-specific
reason (i.e. an honor violation), you would still be eligible to serve
as an enlisted member.
