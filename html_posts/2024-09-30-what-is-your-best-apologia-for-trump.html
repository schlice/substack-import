The Supreme Court says that there is no Constitutional right to an
abortion. Therefore, whether or not to allow abortions in any given
state is up to that state and the people that live in that state.

So the fact that Florida allows abortions up to six weeks and Texas does
not allow abortions at all means that state laws are working as
designed.

Could someone from Texas travel to a state which allowed abortions? Yes.
In addition, there are some states which are setting themselves up as
abortion *destinations*, with charitable organizations setting up room
and board throughout the process. This, too, is working as designed.

Whether or not remember this from our civics classes, states are
*independent*. They can set whatever laws they want within their state,
so long as those laws don't violate the state or federal Constitutions.

It may be confusing, but abortion laws create an ever-changing
landscape. But that's by design.
