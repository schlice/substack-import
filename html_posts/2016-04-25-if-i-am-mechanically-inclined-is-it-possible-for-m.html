I suspect you wouldn\'t be replacing the ductwork in the house, probably
just the furnace/AC unit, the blower, the coils, etc.

As others have already stated, you will most definitely need to pull
permits before you begin your work, and you will have to have your
installation inspected. Be aware, inspectors are notoriously more
stringent with homeowners doing their own work than they are with
contractors. Be prepared to be failed on nit-picky items, and be
prepared to pay for follow-on inspections.

However, with perseverance, you can indeed install it yourself.
