No, it is not possible to "change another person's mind." You do not
have any mystical mind-altering kinesis ability to modify someone's
mind.

At best, what you can do, *for someone who is open to re-examining their
beliefs*, is to get them to do just that: re-examine their beliefs.

It is important for you to understand that this only apply to those who
are willing to re-examine what they believe, in light of new evidence
that they may not have known before. If someone is unwilling to modify
their core beliefs, there is no amount of talking that will "change
their minds."

But if they are willing to re-examine their beliefs, presentation of
adequate evidence may induce them into taking the time to re-examine
whether or not their belief holds up to scrutiny and is still logical
and rational given the new facts you provided.

Original question:

Is it possible to change another person\'s mind when they zealously hold
on to their viewpoint, for example, the pro life/pro choice debate,
their anti vaccination stance or loyal support for Donald Trump?
