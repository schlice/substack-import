Restitution is critical in *certain Christian sects.* It is not as
critical to the totality of Christianity.

For example, the Evangelical Methodist Church and the Pillar of Fire
Methodist Church say that restitution is part of "the way of salvation,"
which includes conviction, repentance, restitution, faith,
justification, regeneration and adoption, which is followed by
sanctification. Their catechisms describe restitution in this way:

> *What do we mean by restitution?*\
> If we have wrongfully taken anything from others, or mistreated them
> in any way, we must make it right by restoring as far as possible.
>
> *Is restitution taught in the Bible?*\
> Yes. \"Them is shall be, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that
> he shall restore that which he took violently away,\...and give it
> unto him to whom it appertaineth\" (Lev. 6:4, 5).
>
> Zacchaeus said: \"Behold, Lord, \...if I have taken anything from any
> man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold\" (Luke
> 19:8).[\[1\]](#IRLTG){#cite-IRLTG .citation_link}

The majority of Christianity do not set this as a requirement, as most
Christian denominations follow the doctrine of [[*sola
fide*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3145d3&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sola_fide){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}, or that you are saved
only by your faith, and God's grace, not by any good works you do.

Denominations which do not follow the *sola fide* doctrine may believe
in things like restitution as necessary to salvation.
