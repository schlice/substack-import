Zero leeway.

If it is discovered that a police officer violated the law while
effecting an arrest, anything that happens after that violation of law
is considered "fruit of the poisonous tree" and is inadmissible.

Here's an example.

A police officer stops a motorist and advises him that he was stopped
because he was using his high beams to signal oncoming drivers that
there was a speed trap ahead. Upon reviewing the motorist's
documentation, he finds that the insurance card is unsigned (a crime in
some states) and arrests the driver.

**Except**, the Supreme Court ruled in *Spence v. Washington* that
flashing your brights at oncoming drivers to alert them of police
activity ahead is considered First-Amendment protected free speech.
Therefore, everything that happened after it (including the discovery of
the unsigned insurance card) was "fruit of the poisonous tree" and never
would have happened had the officer not broken the law in the first
place.

As you can imagine, the man was released and the arrest was thrown out,
and the officer was assigned to mandatory retraining.

\

Of course, this only applies if the officer's lawbreaking is
*discovered*. If it is never discovered that the officer broke the law,
then the extent of leeway is *exactly what he can get away with.*

These days, with the advent of mobile phones and cameras everywhere,
it's much harder for officers to get away with stuff. Besides, with the
tide of public opinion souring against officer abuse, it's not really
worth it for an officer to break the law to make an arrest.
