(EDIT: changing my answer now that details have arisen)

This is a **pitot tube**. Pitot tubes measure air pressure, which help
the aircraft compute things like airspeed and altitude. It works in
conjunction with a **static port** to form the **pitot-static system**.

The problem arises due to what is known as the aircraft's **pressure
field**. As the aircraft moves through the air, it "pushes" and
"compresses" the air in front of it; even the most streamlined aircraft
still produces a pressure field. Every airframe is different, and every
pressure field is different.

Additionally, the pressure field changes (grows, shrinks, morphs) as the
aircraft maneuvers. Especially during high-G maneuvers, or high
angle-of-attack maneuvers, the pressure field surrounding the aircraft
can grow fairly substantially.

The pitot tube needs to be longer than the pressure field to reach into
relatively undisturbed air to better calculate air pressure, with less
compensation needed.
