**Can a landlord restrict the carry of a legal, registered handgun in an
apartment complex in Texas? (Even if the person has a license to carry
whether it be concealed or open carry).**

No.

As of 2019, House Bill 302 prohibits landlords from banning renters and
their guests from carrying firearms in lease agreements.
