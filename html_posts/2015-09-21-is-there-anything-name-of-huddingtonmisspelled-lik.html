**Content:** [Yes, you\'re thinking of [[Huntington\'s disease
(HD)](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3524eb&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntington's_disease){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}, which is a genetic,
degenerative neurological disorder which can develop any time in a
person\'s life, but will generally reduce the lifespan of the affected
person to about 20 years following the initial diagnosis. The patient
will eventually die of pneumonia, heart failure, or other
complications.\
\
This disease is known as the quintessential family disease, because each
child of a parent with HD has a 50/50 chance of developing the disease.\
\
HD is often described as having ALS, Parkinson\'s and Alzheimer\'s \--
simultaneously. Early stage HD usually involves mood and cognition.
Middle stage HD involves more of the movement disorder: inability to
maintain normal movement and involuntary movements, known as \"chorea\".
Late stage HD involves an inability to perform most gross motor
functions, and the patient depends entirely upon caregivers for support.
The patient usually cannot speak, but is still cognizant and recognizes
friends and family.]{.rendered_qtext}
