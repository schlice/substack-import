It's not necessary to own a gun to have an informed view on the gun
control debate.

It ***is*** necessary to be familiar enough with how a gun operates,
what it can do, and what it's designed to do in order to have an
informed view on the gun control debate.

Thankfully, it's not necessary to own a gun in order to be familiar with
them in order to have an informed view on the gun debate in the US.
There are lots of ways you can become familiar with guns in order to
have an informed view on the gun debate. You can learn more about them
from books or videos, or you can take a class like a hunter safety
course or a basic firearms course from a local NRA instructor. None of
these require you to own a gun.
