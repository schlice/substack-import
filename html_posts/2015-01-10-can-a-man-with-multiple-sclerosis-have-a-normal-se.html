**Content:** [Short answer: yes.\
\
Longer answer: It depends on whether or not there is any sexual
dysfunction associated with his MS. The [[National MS
Society](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cb8467&url=http://nmss.org){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="nmss.org"}]{.qlink_container} says that in a recent study,
63% of men have reported some level of sexual dysfunction. Since sexual
arousal begins in the central nervous system, damage along these
pathways can cause dysfunction in arousal and orgasm. Other MS symptoms
such as fatigue and spasticity can affect sex life, as well as
self-esteem and mood changes.\
\
There are medications and medical devices that can be used to assist men
with sexual dysfunction, such as Viagra, Cialis, Levitra, or the MUSE
suppository. There are also implants available that can help as well.\
\
MS does not affect fertility, or the ability to transmit or receive
STDs. Men with MS have to take the same basic precautions against
unplanned pregnancy and STDs as anyone else.]{.rendered_qtext}
