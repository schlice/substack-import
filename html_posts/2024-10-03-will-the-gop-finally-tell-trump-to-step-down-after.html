Humiliation? *Seriously*? What in your esteemed estimation is "the
biggest humiliation" that Trump has given them?

And no, even if Trump "humiliates the GOP," it is not Republicans who
subvert the will of the people. Only Democrats take their duly elected
candidate and throw him away, substituting him for someone who no one
voted for.

It is only Democrats who ignore the will of the people.
