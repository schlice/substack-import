**Content:** [AG Holder:\
\
\"It is possible \[\...\] to imagine an extraordinary circumstance in
which it would be necessary and appropriate under the Constitution and
applicable laws of the United States **for the President to authorize
the military to use lethal force** ***[within the territory of the
United States]{.underline}***.\"\
\
It may be possible to imagine such a circumstance, but that would only
be because you have a very very vivid imagination. [[The Insurrection
Act](https://www.quora.com/Is-the-statement-Theres-a-reason-you-separate-military-and-the-police-One-fights-the-enemies-of-the-state-the-other-serves-and-protects-the-people-When-the-military-becomes-both-then-the-enemies-of-the-state-tend-to-become-the-people-true)]{.qlink_container}
is the only law which allows the US military to act to enforce the laws
of the United States, and even then, the Act is so tightly worded and so
tightly constrained, that you would have to have a situation develop in
the United States that the fully-constituted strength of the states
could not control (this means with full National Guard callout). I
don\'t see that happening.\
\
And it certainly wouldn\'t be legal against a single person, because the
states can control a single person. The President cannot take action
with the US military against US citizens. The [[Posse Comitatus
Act](https://www.quora.com/Is-the-statement-Theres-a-reason-you-separate-military-and-the-police-One-fights-the-enemies-of-the-state-the-other-serves-and-protects-the-people-When-the-military-becomes-both-then-the-enemies-of-the-state-tend-to-become-the-people-true)]{.qlink_container}
strictly forbids this.]{.rendered_qtext}
