Level 2's job is to take escalations from lower level Technical Support
Engineers (TSEs). When the lower level TSE has either reached the limit
of his or her knowledge, or has encountered an issue which will take
considerable time or investigation to solve, they escalate the case to
us.

We may also have to engage our Engineering teams to assist with the
troubleshooting. It's important to note that Engineering is not "Level
Four Tech Support." They are a completely different organization and
they don't have the same tools available to directly support customers.

We also update Service Requests (SRs) to keep customers up to date with
the investigation and our progress. Good notes are important, and our
customers can log in to their accounts and view their organization's
SRs, as well as get all progress updates by email.

We handle the longer-running SRs that we don't want our triage team
(Tier I Support) to handle. We want our L1s to pick up cases, triage
them and either quickly resolve them, or escalate them if the fix will
take longer to investigate.

To the customer, we become the primary contact for the company.

Level 3 Tech Support, for us, is actually a subset of Level 2 support.
It is what we internally refer to as the "Recovery Team." We are
sometimes collectively referred to as "L2/RT." As far as our specific
function, any time a SR has Data Unavailable or Data Loss (DU/DL), the
Recovery Team is engaged. Our charter is to provide the highest level of
technical support to our customers in their hour of greatest need. We
have a notification process which engages our team and simultaneously
notifies our senior leaders of the situation. We are the team focused on
recovering systems in the quickest and safest way possible. We don't
compromise on either of those. We want to recover data as quickly as
possible, but we must keep in mind what actions will risk customer data,
and we will never compromise safety for expediency. We will often choose
a recovery path that is slightly slower, but is safer to the data.

Much of this is company-specific, and each company's delineation and
definition of each level of support is specific to the product they
support, as well as the way in which the organization provides that
support. This is specific to us at Dell EMC.
