It's not even on the same planet, let alone in the same ballpark, as
feasibility.

Disney World took ten years to construct, opening in 1971. Disney's
newest theme park (Animal Kingdom) opened in 1994. Rebuilding costs
using today's dollars would stretch into the tens of billions.

[[Blake Walker\'s answer to How much did it cost to build Walt Disney
World?](/How-much-did-it-cost-to-build-Walt-Disney-World/answer/Blake-Walker)]{.qlink_container}

And note that this answer is roughly six years old.

So even if they did decide to leave Florida, it would take them decades
and billions to rebuild.

Disney World isn't one of those traveling circus things that sets itself
up in the empty field next to the Walmart. It's 27,000 acres of
immersive theme park which took decades to build out. You can't simply
"rebuild" that somewhere else.

It would be cheaper to wait it out and wait for Florida to swing
Democrat again than it would be to rebuild Disney World somewhere else.

So rather than being all "doom-and-gloom," let's talk about what *will*
happen.

The law change which dissolved the Reedy Creek Improvement District was
specifically designed to allow these organizations to fix the issues
with those districts and file to have them restart *on the same day that
the old versions expire*.

**This isn't a law which permanently dissolves RCID. This is a law which
forces it to be renegotiated.**

And have no doubt: whether or not Disney participates in that
renegotiation, there will be a special district which encompasses all of
Disney's property. Whether it will be RCID version 2, or whether it will
be something entirely created by Orange and Osceola counties, it will
exist. It's too economically beneficial for the counties to do without.
