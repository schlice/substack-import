I think such a person should do a lot of serious soul-searching.

- Why do they "want to believe" in God?
- What is stopping them from believing in God?

God's never going to be overt about Himself, because He gave us free
will. He wants us to love Him willingly. He never wants to coerce us
into belief, or love. So He has left enough evidence in this life to
convince anyone *willing to believe,* but He has also left just enough
ambiguity so as to not compel the unwilling.

So it's not about God. God is unchanging. It's about us. If we don't
believe, it's because we choose to not believe.
