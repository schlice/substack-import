**I thought California had strict gun control and red flag laws. How did
the San Diego shooting happen? Why didn\'t the laws prevent this from
happening?**

Because laws don't prevent crime. Laws are not designed to prevent
crime.

Laws provide a legal framework to punish those who violate them.

Remember, someone has to violate the law before the law can punish them.
You can't punish someone before they commit a crime.

We don't know where the shooter got his gun. But if he purchased it
legally, then all the laws in the world wouldn't have stopped him from
doing what he did. He followed the law right up to the point where he
didn't, and you can't predict that with any level of certainty.
