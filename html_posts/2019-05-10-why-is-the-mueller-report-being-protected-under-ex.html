**Why is the Mueller Report being protected under Executive Privilege? I
thought that was to protect private conversations between the President
and his advisors, so that they could speak freely on challenging
subjects.**

First, let's discuss what exactly is being protected, since it seems
like you're a little confused about how we got to this point.

The Attorney General already released the Mueller report. According to
law, some of the parts of the report could not be released, such as
information about grand jury testimony, so some of it had to be
*redacted*. So let's understand what I just said: Congress passed a law
that says that grand jury testimony is protected information and cannot
be released. Therefore, some of the redactions in the Mueller report
were done because of laws passed by Congress. Some were for other
reasons, such as other investigations in progress, or privacy concerns.

Congress wants to now see the **full, unredacted report.** Bear in mind
what I just said in the last paragraph: some of the redacted portions of
the report were redacted because of laws. Passed by Congress.

Barr explained to them exactly what was redacted and why. He even
offered to provide a *less-redacted* report for their review in a
secured room, with tight controls on the physical copies of the report
such that if they chose to do so, they could review the less-redacted
report. He would restore the information redacted because of privacy
concerns, and he would restore the information regarding other federal
and state investigations currently in progress, but he would not restore
the information which he is required to protect by law.

This, too, was not good enough for House Democrats. The Democrats on the
House Judiciary Committee, in a party-line vote, voted to subpoena the
**full, unredacted report**, which Barr is not authorized by law to
produce.

Barr, again, refused to break the law and refused to release that full,
unredacted report, because a subpoena cannot authorize someone to break
the law.

The House Judiciary Committee doubled-down on their demand for the AG to
break the law, and decided, in yet another party-line vote, to hold him
in *contempt of Congress*. For refusing to break the law. That they
wrote.

In an effort to forestall any further hand-wringing over the AG's
refusal to release the full, unredacted report (which, in case you
missed it above, he can't do under the law), the President claimed
executive privilege over the full, unredacted report, as well as
Mueller's investigation notes (which also contain a great deal of
personal information, as well as legally protected information).

Next, let's talk about [[Executive
Privilege](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=19a368&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_privilege){.external_link

There are two flavors of Executive Privilege: there is the one you
mentioned (presidential communications privilege) which is rooted in the
separation of powers, and there is also "deliberative process privilege"
which is rooted in common law. For example, when Congress demanded,
under subpoena, materials related to the Justice Department operation
known as *Fast and Furious*, the AG rejected that subpoena, citing
"Presidents have repeatedly asserted executive privilege to protect
confidential Executive Branch deliberative materials from congressional
subpoena."

President Trump did exactly the same thing in this case, citing the
deliberative process privilege under which the full, unredacted report
was being protected. The *New York Times* noted that this was Trump's
"first use of the secrecy powers as president".

However, it shouldn't have been necessary for Trump to assert Executive
Privilege over the unredacted report. The AG was not authorized, under
law, to release the full report. The House Judiciary Committee should
not have attempted to force the AG to violate the law. So Trump stepped
in to forestall the release of the full, unredacted report. Now, instead
of dealing with a recalcitrant AG, Congress must overcome an assertion
of Executive Privilege. Historically, only two claims of Executive
Privilege over congressional subpoena were ever heard by federal courts,
and neither of those cases made it to the Supreme Court.
