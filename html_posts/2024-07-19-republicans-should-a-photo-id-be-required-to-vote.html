Unless there is another way to *conveniently* prove that you are a
citizen of the United States AND you are registered to vote in that
precinct, then government-issued photo ID is usually the most convenient
way to do so.

Remember the goal here: we want to ensure that elections remain free and
fair, but we also want to ensure that *only* the people who are
registered in that precinct, and who are actual citizens of the United
States, may vote in that election.

I think calls for allowing anyone, even those without photo ID, are
mostly an affront to **women.**

Why?

Women fought for a very long time in a movement called the *suffrage
movement.* This was a decades-long movement in the United States to give
women the right to vote. According to the National Archives, "several
generations of woman suffrage supporters lectured, wrote, marched,
lobbied, and practiced civil disobedience to achieve what many Americans
considered a radical change in the Constitution -- guaranteeing women
the right to vote."[\[1\]](#suwQR){#cite-suwQR .citation_link}

And today, modern-day Democrats want to *cheapen* that effort by
allowing *anyone* to vote, without even proving that they are a citizen
of the United States? Women should be insulted by such calls. They
fought *hard* to earn the right to vote, and for what? For Democrats to
summarily declare that the fight was for naught, because now you don't
even have to prove you are a citizen to vote in our elections?

We are watching Democrats attempt to radically re-make this country into
something it was never intended to be. And if we do not push back, we
will lose whatever gains have been made over the last hundred years or
so.
