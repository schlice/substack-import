Well, it's slightly more nuanced than that.

Yes, Trump was discussing some ongoing trade negotiations with Tim Cook,
the CEO of Apple, when they discussed relocating iPhone manufacturing
from China to India.

Trump said, \"They \[India\] have offered us a deal where basically they
have agreed to charge us literally no tariffs. I said \'Tim, we are
treating you really good, we put up with all the plants you built in
China for years. We are not interested in you building in India. India
can take care of themselves\'.\"

India responded back swiftly, saying that "talks are still going on" and
\"nothing is decided till everything is.\"

In other words, the idea is still on the table, but it's not a "done
deal" yet. The talks are still preliminary.
