Answer: **ObamaCare.**

ObamaCare is also called the "Affordable Care Act." Because it is
anything but affordable, I hesitate to use that name. Suffice it to say
that any reference to ACA or the Affordable Care Act or ObamaCare refer
to the same thing.

ObamaCare accomplished its goal of providing insurance to everyone at
all costs by opening the floodgates and enrolling more people in
Medicaid. It changed the coverage rules, allowing more people to enroll
in Medicaid in order to get them insured. It then spent over \$1
trillion in tax revenue to subsidize premiums, and added massive
regulation and taxes on insurance companies, many of which,
counterproductively, raised premiums.

Despite incessant claims by the left, these people will not lose
coverage if they want to keep it.

Therefore, we are going to have to prop up Medicaid for the foreseeable
future, thanks to ObamaCare.

What we do with *new* people entering the workforce, on the other hand,
is a completely different story. Hopefully, it's what gets addressed
under the American Health Care Act.
