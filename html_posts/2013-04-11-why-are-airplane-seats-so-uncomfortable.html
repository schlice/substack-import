**Content:** [The primary consideration in designing an airline seat is
your safety. However, we have to recognize that people fly in these
seats, and they do so voluntarily. If you want to understand the
difference, look at military aircraft and their seating.\
\
If you\'re not sitting in a **jumpseat** (an aluminum frame with webbed
straps over it), you\'re sitting in a passenger seat\...facing backwards
(towards the rear of the aircraft). Why? It\'s far safer to sit facing
backwards than forwards. In a forward-facing seat, you have to brace for
impact, either with your head in your arms on the seat in front of you,
or in your lap. Bracing for impact on a military transport means sitting
up straight in your seat and keeping your head still against the
backrest. The seat absorbs the impact, and the force of the impact is
spread throughout the entire seat, not just the seatbelt as in a
traditional airline seat.\
\
If it\'s so safe that way, why aren\'t all aircraft seats facing the
back of the plane? Because, as I mentioned in the beginning, people fly
voluntarily in these seats, and Mr. John Q. Public doesn\'t want to sit
facing backwards for the whole flight.\
\
So we have to recognize that airline seats are trying to do the same job
of keeping you safe while facing you in a less-safe direction. Doing
this without increasing the weight of the seat or decreasing the comfort
of the seat is a tricky balancing act. There is an entire discipline
(and a college major) devoted to this practice called Human Factors
Engineering. It\'s an extremely complex science, but the idea is to find
that balance between safety and comfort.]{.rendered_qtext}
