You'll have the best luck if your phone is from AT&T or T-Mobile, as 90%
of the mobile networks in Africa are GSM-based.

You will need to unlock your phone (you'll probably have to pay to do
that, since you, like most people, probably haven't paid off your phone
yet. If you did, the carrier will help you unlock it), and then when you
arrive in Africa, buy a SIM card which works with the GSM provider where
you will be. Pop it in, and off you go.

If you have Verizon here in the states, there is a *chance* your phone
will work, as there is some CDMA coverage in Africa, but not much. Check
the carriers in the area you will be staying to see if there is a CDMA
carrier. However, Verizon doesn't use SIM cards, so you'll likely have
to pay for their International service. Make sure you do, because if you
just use your phone without the International plan, you will pay the *a
la carte* rates, and those are **super expensive**.

Another alternative is renting a cheap phone while you are there. Plenty
of providers will rent you a country-specific mobile device with a local
number for you to use in-country. Just search up international mobile
rental on the Big G..
