I'm going to venture a guess and say that this is the Harvest Church you
are referencing (since you didn't specify):

[[https://harvest.org/](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=77b146&url=https://harvest.org/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container}

I don't have a problem with their stated beliefs. They believe in *sola
scriptura*, *sola fide* and *sola Cristo* from what I can see from their
website. I can also infer that they probably believe in *sola gratia*
and *soli deo gloria* as well, meaning that they believe in the five
*solas* of the Reformation.

Which puts their beliefs squarely in line with mine.

If there was something specific about them you wanted to discuss,
perhaps you should ask about that.
