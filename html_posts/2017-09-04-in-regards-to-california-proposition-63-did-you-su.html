The law's provisions making large capacity magazines illegal (according
to the link you posted) was set to go into effect July 1, 2017.

On June 29, 2017, Judge Roger Benitez ordered Attorney General Becerra
to not enforce or implement the large magazine sections of Proposition
63. Judge Benitez\'s order is a preliminary injunction, meaning the
order is temporary pending conclusion of the legal case. Judge Benitez
said Proposition 63\'s section on large-capacity magazines is likely
unconstitutional because it \"burdens the core of the Second Amendment
by criminalizing the mere possession of these magazines that are
commonly held by law-abiding citizens for defense of self, home, and
state.\"

He also stated, \"The State of California's desire to criminalize simple
possession of a firearm magazine able to hold more than 10 rounds is
precisely the type of policy choice that the Constitution takes off the
table.\"

So because that section of the law never came into effect, no one who
owns a magazine larger than 10 rounds is an "outlaw" under Prop 63.
