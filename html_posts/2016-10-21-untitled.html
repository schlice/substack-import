I understand it, but I don't agree with it. If the town doesn't want to
pay firefighters, that's all well and good. But not providing them with
resources to do their jobs is simply criminal, and violates the spirit
of the Constitution in many ways. It's sad that volunteer fire
departments have to hold bake sales to buy fire trucks.

And thanks for adding your opinion, but you really should have made this
an answer to the original question, rather than a comment on my answer.
