God cannot abide sin. This is why sinners go to hell. Plain and simple.

When Adam and Eve sinned, God removed them from the perfect place He
created for them, and sent them out into the world that *their sin
created for themselves*: a world where they need to scratch at the hard
ground to get it to produce any crops, a world where they experience
painful childbirth, and a world where they experience failing bodies,
disease, and eventual death.

So in essence, God didn't banish them. Their own choices caused them to
have to leave.

But all hope was not lost.

God sent a lifeboat to save us from this sinking ship we created for
ourselves. His name is Jesus. His death and resurrection saved us from
death, and his shed blood redeems us.
