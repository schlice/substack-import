I'm going to take these out of order.

> **Is it considered blind faith to believe in something without
> tangible evidence?**

I would argue that ***you*** believe in quite a few things which have no
tangible evidence. In fact, there are a number of things we are all
rational to believe, even though science cannot prove them. Here's a
short list:

- Logic and Math. Science cannot prove them, because science presupposes
  them.
- Metaphysical truths, such as believing that there are minds which
  exist outside of my own.
- Aesthetic judgements. Science cannot prove that a sunset is beautiful.
- Ethical judgements. Science similarly cannot prove that the Nazis were
  evil. The good, like the beautiful, cannot be proven through science.

And probably most surprisingly,

- Science itself. The belief that scientific experimentation produces
  truth cannot be proven through the scientific method. You therefore
  assume (through faith) that science produces truth.

With that understanding, let's address the first part of your question.

> **Can the existence of God be proven if He has no physical form?**

The answer is a resounding yes. Since we know that we are all rational
to believe some things even though we don't have physical proof, we know
that there must be other ways to determine truth *outside* of empirical
evidence. Besides, it makes no sense to look for tangible evidence of an
intangible God. Whether or not you believe that God exists, if He does,
He *necessarily* is transcendent and immaterial. So you're never going
to find one of God's hairs, or see one of God's footprints. It's
illogical.

Does that mean it is impossible to demonstrate that God exists? No. It
simply means that science is not the right means, just as a metal
detector is not the right tool to find a plastic cup.

The right means are "logical proofs," which are contained in the
discipline called *philosophy.* Philosophy is concerned with life's most
important issues, from morality to meaning to God. Philosophy allows us
to probe realities that can't be detected through our senses; thus,
philosophy provides an excellent method to explore evidence for the
existence of God.

Let's not forget, philosophy is not divorced from science, as if you can
rely on science alone, and philosophy is just pseudo-babble for PhDs to
discuss while smoking pipes in dimly-lit rooms. Philosophy is the
*foundation* of science. Science is dependent on philosophy. In fact,
***science is a slave to philosophy.*** Bad philosophy results in bad
science, and good science requires good philosophy. Why? Because:

1.  **Science cannot be done without philosophy.** Philosophical
    assumptions are utilized in the search for causes, and, therefore,
    cannot be the result of them. For example, as we've already
    addressed, scientists assume (by faith) that reason and the
    scientific method allow us to accurately understand the world around
    us. That cannot be proven by science itself. You can't prove the
    tools of science (i.e. the laws of logic, the Law of Causality, the
    Principle of Uniformity, or the reliability of observation) by
    running some kind of experiment. You have to assume those things are
    true in order to do the experiment. So science is built on
    philosophy. Unfortunately, many so-called scientists are very poor
    philosophers.
2.  **Philosophical assumptions can dramatically impact scientific
    conclusions**. If a scientist assumes beforehand that only natural
    causes are possible, then probably no amount of evidence will
    convince him that intelligence created the first one-celled amoeba
    or any other designed entity. When Darwinists presuppose that
    intelligent causes are impossible, then natural laws are the only
    game in town. Likewise, if a creationist rules out natural causes
    beforehand (and I don't know of any who do), then he also risks
    missing the right answer. But a scientist who is open-minded to both
    natural and intelligent causes can follow the evidence wherever it
    leads.
3.  **Science doesn't really say anything---scientists do.** Data are
    always interpreted by scientists. When those scientists let their
    personal preferences or unproven philosophical assumptions dictate
    their interpretation of the evidence, they do exactly what they
    accuse religious people of doing---they let their ideology dictate
    their conclusions. When that's the case, their conclusions should be
    questioned, because they may be nothing more than philosophical
    presuppositions passed off as scientific facts.

Philosophy typically offers evidence in the form of *arguments*. In
fact, thinkers over the years have identified no fewer than twenty
arguments for God, arguments that range from the clear and simple to the
extremely complex. Some of these arguments appeal to the universe or
history, others to the existence of reason and beauty.

We can approach the God question from many angles, and there is no one
best way. But I think there is one argument that is not only clear and
convincing, but easy enough to understand.

First, if terms like "arguments" or "evidence" bother you, you might
instead consider these arguments as "clues" that converge and point to a
common conclusion, much the way road signs guide you to a specific
destination. A sign doesn't prove that the destination exists, but it
does point the way. These arguments are signposts to God. So, let us
look at one signpost that in my opinion, presents perhaps the simplest
yet most powerful argument for God's existence.

The Kalam argument dates back to the Middle Ages but has been made
popular today by William Lane Craig, an evangelical Christian
philosopher. The argument is very simple; in fact, it is probably the
easiest of all the arguments to understand, having only two premises and
one conclusion:

- P1: Everything which has a beginning has a cause.
- P2: The universe had a beginning.
- C1: The universe has a cause.

So let's dig in to these two premises and one conclusion:

**Premise 1:** This statement says everything that has a beginning has a
cause. It's very important that we get this right. Some atheists try to
refute this premise by responding, "But if everything that exists has a
cause, and God exists, then what caused God?" But the premise does not
claim, "Everything that *exists* has a cause." It says, "Everything that
*begins to exist* has a cause." Since God, by definition, and whether
you believe in Him or not, is eternal and never began to exist, this
first premise does not apply to Him. Therefore, the rhetorical question
"What caused God?" is like asking, "To whom is the bachelor married?" or
"What is the sound of one hand clapping?" Regardless of whether
bachelors or hands exist, these questions do not make sense. They are
literally nonsense because they confuse the meaning of terms.

Okay, back to the first premise. Is it true? Does everything that begins
to exist have a cause? For most people, the answer is yes; it is common
sense. Almost nobody denies it. The statement simply means that nothing
just springs into existence, randomly and without a cause. For if things
did come into being this way, then our world would be a wild spree of
things apparently popping into existence like sleight of hand magic.
Only it would be worse, since with sleight of hand you at least have a
magician who pulls rabbits out of a hat. However, in a world that
violates this first premise, rabbits would pop in and out of being even
without magicians or hats. Few sane people believe the world works this
way. Even the great atheist David Hume said, "I never asserted so absurd
a proposition as that something should arise without a cause." So,
through experience and reflection most people, even most honest
atheists, agree that everything that begins to exist has a cause.

**Premise 2:** This claim is slightly more controversial than the first
one. In fact, no less a thinker than St. Thomas Aquinas says that the
truth that the world had a beginning of its duration is only
conclusively known by faith and not by reason. Nonetheless, a host of
the greatest minds from antiquity to the present, including St.
Bonaventure in the Middle Ages and William Lane Craig today, offer
arguments that purport to defend this truth. An example of one of these
arguments, one which St. Bonaventure includes in his paradoxes of the
infinite, goes as follows: If the world has always existed, then there
would be an infinite number of past days. However, if there were an
infinite number of past days, we never would have been able to arrive at
the present day because an infinite series, by definition, cannot be
traversed. Since we have arrived at today (and today is the end date of
history), it follows that there must have been a beginning of time (a
beginning date).

Modern physics also seems to give weight to this position. Despite
cyclic cosmological models advanced by some physicists in recent years,
since the advent of the big bang theory in the twentieth century, the
scientific consensus is that the universe did have a beginning roughly
fourteen billion years ago. Alexander Vilenkin, a leading non-Christian
cosmologist, was invited to speak at a colloquium for Stephen Hawking's
seventieth birthday. There, in front of the greatest scientists in the
world, Vilenkin said, "All the evidence we have says that the universe
had a beginning." It is rare for scientists to speak with this measure
of conclusiveness, but Vilenkin stated his opinion that it is not just
that *some* of the evidence points to a beginning of the universe, or
even the *majority* of evidence, but that *all* of the evidence points
that way today.

**Conclusion**: The two premises are widely accepted today: everything
that begins to exist has a cause, and the universe began to exist. If
that is the case, then the third statement, the conclusion of the
argument, logically follows. We cannot avoid the fact that if everything
that begins to exist has a cause, and the universe began to exist, then
the universe must have had a cause.

This logical conclusion leads us to wonder: if the universe had a cause,
*what* is that cause? The cause certainly could not have been anything
*within* the universe or even *the universe itself*, since things can't
cause themselves to come into existence. This idea defies logic. Thus,
the cause of the universe must be something *beyond* the universe,
something beyond all matter, energy, space, and time. In other words, it
must be transcendent (beyond the universe), it must be immaterial
(beyond matter and space), it must be eternal (beyond time), and if it
has created something so massively complex as the universe, it must be
tremendously powerful and intelligent. Well, a transcendent, immaterial,
eternal, supremely powerful, and intelligent cause of the
universe---what does that sound like to you? As Thomas Aquinas pithily
puts it, "This is what most people mean by 'God.'"

Now of course, this doesn't tell us anything about *which* God exists,
or anything about that God. It simply is a logical proof which shows
that logically-speaking, a creator God must exist.
