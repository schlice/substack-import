**Will I get in trouble/pulled over if I flip-off a cop as I am passing
through their speed trap?**

Flipping someone off in the United States is a First Amendment-protected
expression of speech.

However, doing so will likely get you "increased attention" by those
police officers, and there's likely something they can find for which
you should be stopped.

Just because you *can* do something doesn't mean you *should.*
