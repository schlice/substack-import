**Can a 3 unit condo association be dissolved making each unit
responsible for its own property? What does it entail?**

Yes it can be done. Check with the laws in your state and in your city
to determine what exactly needs to be done.

You will need the assistance of a real estate attorney who has knowledge
of association laws in your jurisdiction. If you have 100% agreement and
signatures from all of the owners, you can usually dissolve an
association.

Some things will need to be handled, like ownership of community
property. Many times, community property can be charitably donated, or
disposed of in other ways. Handling other things which were paid for by
the association will still need to take place, such as the water bill
for your community landscaping. If you're planning on separating the
landscaping out into individual meters, the city will have to come in
and do that work, and they will charge you for it. Plus, there are the
attorney's fees and the filing fees with your city or county.

So while it is not free, and while there are some things you will have
to take care of, it can be done.

Your first step is finding a real estate attorney who can handle the
transaction.
