**My car is being gifted to me, and I want to sell it after it's gifted.
How do I go about that? I don't want to put insurance on it because it
will be sitting until sold.**

Once you have the title, the car is yours to do with as you please. You
can turn right around and sell it. I suggest you get a "gift letter"
together and both sign it so that you can prove it was a gift.

When you sell it, follow your state's rules for private auto sales. You
usually need some form of a bill of sale and you need to sign the title
over to the new buyer. Since you aren't driving it, chances are you
won't have plates on it either, so nothing to worry about there.

Do check with your county or your state to ensure you accomplish all the
correct paperwork.
