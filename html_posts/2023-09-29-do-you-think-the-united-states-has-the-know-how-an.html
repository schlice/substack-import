So you're asking whether or not we have the requisite knowledge and
ability to put a man on the moon again. So to me, you're asking the
following:

- **Know-how:** Do we have the technical knowledge required to calculate
  the orbital mechanics to launch a vehicle to get a man to the moon
- **Ability:** Do we have the hardware to make it happen

So with this in mind, I'd say that yes, we have the technical know-how,
but no, we don't currently have the ability. We would have to design
entirely new launch vehicles, new lunar landers, etc. in order to get
there and get home. The investment in the vehicles, in today's dollars,
would be incredibly large.

***Can*** it be done? Without a doubt. We did it once, we can do it
again. ***Will*** it be done any time soon? Without a compelling reason
to put a man on the moon again, I don't see it happening. We've done it
once, we've proved we can do it, and there doesn't appear to be a reason
why we would want to do it again. It would have to be part of a larger
project, like maybe establishing a base on the moon from which we can
launch interplanetary missions.
