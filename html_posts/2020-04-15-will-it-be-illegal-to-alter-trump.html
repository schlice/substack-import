**Will it be illegal to alter Trump\'s \"signature\" on my \$1200 check,
as he himself is not giving us the money personally?**

People appear to have the horrible misconception that Trump will somehow
be signing your checks.

This is Fake News.™ If you read this from a website, consider this your
first indication that you're reading Fake News™ from that site.

What will **actually** happen is that up in the corner of the check,
right underneath where it says "Economic Impact Payment", it's going to
say "President of the United States Donald J. Trump". It's still a
completely valid check. You can absolutely take it to the bank and get
\$1200 in cash. It will be made out to you, and signed by the Treasury
Department.

The text on the face of the check just identifies why you're getting it.
When you file your tax return, you get a check which looks exactly the
same, except the text in the corner doesn't say "Economic Impact
Payment," it says "Federal Income Tax Refund". The text doesn't change
anything about the legality of the check.
