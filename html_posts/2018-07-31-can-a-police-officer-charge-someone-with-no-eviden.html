**Can an officer arrest someone with no proof?**

The level of proof required for arrest in the United States is called
"probable cause." It means that the officer has to have a logical
belief, supported by facts and circumstances, that a crime has occurred,
or is about to occur.

The level of proof required to *detain* someone is called "reasonable
suspicion." It's a "reasonable belief" based on facts and circumstances
that a crime may have been committed, or is about to be committed.

Taking [[Steven
Clelland](https://www.quora.com/profile/Steven-Clelland)]{.qlink_container}'s
examples, "someone hanging out behind a closed store in the middle of
the night, in an area where burglaries have taken place" constitutes
"reasonable suspicion" that a crime may have taken place, or is about to
take place. That person can be detained and questioned to see if that is
truly the case. "Someone behind the same store with a crowbar in his
hand trying to force the door open" is "probable cause" to effect an
arrest for attempted burglary and possession of burglary tools.

After the person is arrested, they are arraigned. Arraignment is where
the person hears the charges against them and gets to plead guilty or
not guilty.

Some states will automatically schedule a preliminary hearing at this
point if the person pleads not guilty, and in some states, a preliminary
hearing must be requested. In either case, at the preliminary hearing,
the state must prove that they had probable cause to believe that a
crime was committed and the defendant did it.

Back to your question: at this point (the PC hearing), if the officer
arrested someone with no proof, the state would not have any proof to
show that they had probable cause to effect the arrest, and the case
against the defendant would be dismissed and the defendant would be
released.

So can a person be arrested without proof? Yes they can, but they won't
get very far through the system before they are released for, you
guessed it, lack of proof.
