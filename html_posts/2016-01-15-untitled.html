Police are never trained to \"shoot to kill.\"

Firearms are lethal weapons. That means that any time you use them, the
outcome is likely going to be the death of the person on the operative
end of the firearm. That\'s understood. But the end result of the
shooting is not designed to be death. Yes, a firearm is a lethal weapon,
but the \"goal\" of using the firearm is not \"to kill.\" The goal is to
stop the perpetrator from doing something, or to prevent that person
from doing something, when all other methods of force have failed (or
cannot be used \-- if the person is out of Taser range, for example).
You don\'t shoot to kill; you shoot to stop the act.

It seems like a pretty thin difference to be sure, but to understand the
difference, think about this: if an officer fires his weapon and the
suspect goes down but is still alive, did the officer fail to do his
job? Not at all. Does the officer walk up to the downed criminal and
\"finish the job?\" Certainly not. The officer successfully stopped the
suspect, no one else was hurt, and to top it all off, the suspect is
still alive to face charges. Win-win-win.

If you are going to fire your weapon, and you know that your goal is to
stop the act, where do you aim for in order to have the maximum
potential to stop the act? Center mass. Never legs, arms, head, etc.
Always center mass. Let SWAT take the trick shots. An officer making a
split-second decision is always going to shoot to stop the act, and he
is going to fire at the point on the body where he has the best chance
of doing just that. Suspects who are high on certain drugs (opiates
usually, sometimes meth) have a great tolerance for pain (it\'s rumored
that certain special forces units use these drugs just before entering
combat to keep them fighting through combat wounds). Therefore, leg and
arm hits may not stop some suspects; they may keep coming after they are
hit. Center mass is the only place that you have the highest chance to
stop the suspect, every time.

Don\'t forget, even if the officer does fire for the legs or the arms,
he could hit a major artery and the suspect could easily bleed out long
before any medical care could arrive. So even a shot in the leg could be
fatal.

*But my point is, don\'t count on the police doing exactly the right
thing to keep you alive in a violent confrontation. My advice is really
for the people who might get shot.*

Again, when the police fire, they aren\'t trying to kill, or even trying
to \"not kill,\" or to keep you alive. The police fire because you
didn\'t do something you were told to do, or you did something you were
told not to do, and the threat to the public in allowing you to
continue, and the risk of your death is less of a priority than the risk
of you continuing to go on doing what you are doing.

Lesson to be learned: if you want to find out how far a police officer
will go to stop you from doing something they told you to stop doing,
ignore them when they give you commands.
