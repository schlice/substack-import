We need to be abundantly clear about this.

In every state where abortion restrictions exist, protections have been
written into the law to allow for doctors to save the life of a mother.
As of January 6, 2025, there are 18 states which have some level of
restriction of abortion.

There are four categories of exceptions to abortion bans:

1.  **Life**. This is the question which was asked. This exception is to
    prevent the death of the mother. **All 18 states which currently
    have abortion restrictions in place allow abortion in order to
    prevent the death of the mother.**
2.  **Health**. This exception allows abortion when there is risk to the
    health of the mother. **Only 12 of the 18 states which restrict
    abortion have this exception.**
3.  **Rape/incest.** This exception permits abortion when the pregnancy
    is the result of rape or incest. **Only 10 of the 18 states which
    restrict abortion have this exception.**
4.  **Fetal anomaly.** This exception permits abortion when there is a
    lethal fetal anomaly. **Only 8 of the 18 states which restrict
    abortion have this exception**.[\[1\]](#NUpgz){#cite-NUpgz

But now, we need to talk about these restrictions.

The question asked about "legal protections for doctors" who need to
terminate pregnancies to save lives, and that is a much more detailed
and nuanced question than "what laws exist."

And the answer to that question, as with all legal answers, is "it
depends."

In some states, the restrictions are very clear. Doctors know precisely
in which what situations they can perform an abortion and what
situations they cannot. In other states, the laws are very unclear, and
doctors are afraid to do their jobs for fear of being prosecuted.

The TLDR here is that there are indeed legal protections in general, but
how they are written into state law varies wildly by state, and doctors
in some states are afraid to perform abortions even with legal
protections because those laws are poorly written.
