What we call "squatter's rights" are actually a legal principle called
"adverse possession." "Squatter's rights" is the colloquialism for the
laws surrounding adverse possession.

Adverse possession is a legal method by which someone other than the
title owner gains possession of a piece of land. It is a legal situation
that occurs when one party is granted title to another person\'s
property by taking possession of it. This can happen intentionally or
unintentionally with or without the property owner\'s knowledge.

Intentional adverse possession is when a **squatter** or a trespasser
gains access to a piece of property and takes possession. Unintentional
adverse possession may occur, for example, when a neighbor builds a
fence on your property. The adverse possessor (also referred to as the
**disseisor**) can lay claim to that property. And if the claimant is
successful in proving adverse possession, they are not required to pay
the owner for the land.

State law varies on the requirements to prove adverse possession. States
can require any amount of time that the disseisor must be in possession
of the land, most require at least seven years before they can prove
adverse possession. But in general, there are five requirements to prove
adverse possession:

> - **Continuous use:** Under this condition, the adverse possessor must
>   show they\'ve been in continuous and uninterrupted possession of the
>   property in question for the period of time specified in state law.
> - **Hostile and adverse occupation of the property:** Although this
>   doesn\'t mean that the disseisor uses force to take the land, they
>   must show there is no existing agreement or license from the
>   landowner such as a written easement, lease, or rent agreement.
> - **Open and notorious possession:** The person seeking adverse
>   possession must occupy a property in a manner that is open,
>   notorious, and obvious. The true owner is not required, however, to
>   be aware of the occupation.
> - **Actual possession:** The possessor must actively possess the
>   property for the state\'s predetermined statutory period, which may
>   vary from three to 30 years. Possession may involve maintaining the
>   land and---depending on state law---paying taxes.
> - **Exclusive use:** The property is used solely by the disseisor,
>   excluding any others from using it as
>   well.[\[1\]](#mqOND){#cite-mqOND .citation_link}

Property owners should take steps to prevent adverse possession. They
should identify property boundaries and clearly mark them. If they find
an adverse possessor, they should attempt to, perhaps, rent the property
to the disseisor. With a proper rental agreement in place, the
trespasser cannot claim adverse possession. You could also grant written
permission to someone to use your land, and make sure you get their
written acknowledgment. Again, with a proper agreement in place, the
trespasser cannot claim adverse possession.
