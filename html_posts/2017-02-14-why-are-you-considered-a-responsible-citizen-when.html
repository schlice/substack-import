Part of being a responsible citizen means doing your "civic duty."

When we live in a community, we all know we have rights. We have our
rights to live (mostly) free from government intrusion in our lives.
Government, on the other hand, provides services (paid for by our taxes)
that make it possible for us to live together in communities. These
services include, but are not limited to, fire, police, hospitals,
roads, infrastructure (water, gas, sewer), recreation areas, etc.

The Constitution says that people have the right to a jury of their
peers. As we know, with every right, there is a requisite
responsibility. If we have a right to a jury of our peers, we have a
responsibility as "peers" to staff that jury. It is up to us, as
citizens, to be the "peers" that make the system work. We cannot have a
right to a trial by a jury of our peers if we do not shoulder the
requisite responsibility to be the peers.

In my community, they attempt to make it as fair and equitable as
possible. They randomly select the jury pool from driver license rolls
and other demographic information. We have what's called the "one day,
one trial" system. You can only be called once per calendar year. If you
are called and you sit in the jury room but are never impaneled into a
jury, you have fulfilled your civic duty by being available for the
pool. If you are selected for be part of the pool of candidates for a
jury but are not selected to sit on that jury (as a primary or an
alternate), you have fulfilled your civic duty. If you are asked to
leave the jury during attorney pre-trial questioning, you have fulfilled
your civic duty. If you sit for an entire trial, you clearly have
fulfilled your duty.

The point is that arriving at court and being available to be one of the
"peers" spoken of in the Constitution is part of the "requirement" that
speaks to the "right" to have a trial by jury of your peers. If we are
to live in a community, and if we are to make the Constitution work for
everyone, we must fulfill our civic duty to staff that system when
needed. Responsible citizens fulfill their civic duty when they are
called to do so.
