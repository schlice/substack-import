**Is it okay to give police donuts?**

Thanks for your kindness in thinking of the police. I will tell you
though that the police are unlikely to simply eat a box of donuts that
was brought in by a random citizen, as there is often a high chance that
someone was actually trying to *hurt* the police by giving them tainted
food. They're even sometimes skeptical when *one of their own* brings in
food.

If you happen to be in line at the donut shop with an officer, maybe you
can offer to buy a dozen donuts for the squad. Explain that you'd like
to give donuts to them, but because of the aforementioned reasons, you'd
rather not just drop off a box of donuts to the station. Instead, offer
to pay for a dozen that the officer can take possession of directly from
the store.
