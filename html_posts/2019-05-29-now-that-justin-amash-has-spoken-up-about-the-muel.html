**Now that Justin Amash has spoken up about the Mueller Report and his
concerns about what the report reveals about the Trump administration,
do you think that other Republicans will be brave enough to speak up as
well?**

I literally don't care.

If Congress, in its collective wisdom, believes that enough evidence
exists to impeach the President, then they should have the courage of
their convictions to call for Articles of Impeachment to be passed. If
they don't, but they feel that enough evidence exists that a crime *may*
have been committed, they can pass a resolution opening up an
impeachment inquiry.

But they must act. It is time now for Congress to shit or get off the
pot.

Either file articles of impeachment, open an impeachment inquiry, or
leave it alone and stop "speaking up." You're Congress!

DO SOMETHING!

OR DON'T!

Either impeach the man, or get back to the business of passing laws.

But continuously "speaking up" does nothing.
