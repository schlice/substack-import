The Bible doesn't say anything about homophobia. But I will tell you
that the Bible declares that homosexual activity is indeed sinful, so
clearly in fact that it defies reinterpretation. "Sexism" is only a
thing insofar as the Bible definitely has well-defined gender roles, as
God designed men and women for specific tasks and equipped them properly
to do those tasks.

Believing that the Bible does not say what it clearly says is not
something that Christian believers do. We believe that the Bible is
inerrant, and it's really, really easy to find out whether or not the
BIble was "misinterpreted" or had anything "added" to it, because we
have it in its original languages. We can therefore see the original
words as they were written, so you can find out for yourself whether or
not anything was "misinterpreted" or "added." There are even websites
which will show you, side by side, the original language and the
modern-day translations. I would recommend BibleHub to you if you are
interested in doing that work yourself, and if you question whether the
Bible says what it clearly says, I encourage you to use that resource.

You can absolutely call yourself Christian. Many people call themselves
Christians. Mormons call themselves Christians (their official church
name even has Jesus in it), even though they hold beliefs which run
counter to those core Christian beliefs we expect to see in Christians.

But *calling* yourself Christian doesn't *make* you a Christian.

Here's the problem with your belief.

If you believe Jesus is your savior, how do you know? From where do you
get your information? Is it from the Bible? If it is, how can you trust
that the Bible is reliable if you believe that the Bible has errors?

What exactly is the Bible wrong about? And how do you know it is wrong?
Because either the Bible is the unequivocal standard of what is true, or
something else is.

In order for you to say the Bible is wrong, you must know what is right.
Where do you get your standard of right and wrong if it is not from the
Bible?

**And that's the problem.** Usually, the answer is "because sexism and
homophobia is wrong, society says so." Usually, you will cite some
source for morals outside of God and outside of the Bible, and none of
those sources are reliable or universal.
