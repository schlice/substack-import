When elections come around, run for the Board and do it yourself.

You will likely see first hand that it\'s difficult to balance the needs
of enforcing the covenants with making sure that you are not
"overzealous."

The point that I\'m trying to make is that many homeowners believe that
they can do it better, yet they never put themselves out there and try
to actually do it better.

If you think you can do a better job at running the association, then by
all means, join the Board and do it yourself. The problem is that I
don\'t see anybody stepping up to put their money where their mouth is.
