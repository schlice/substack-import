**Content:** [There is an oxygen mask in the lav. If there is rapid
decompression while you are in the lav, the door will pop open and you
will see your mask, or it will drop out of the compartment (depending on
lav configuration). If this happens, **put your mask on and stay
there.** Feel free to get up off the bowl if you so choose, but I\'d
hang on while the plane completes rapid descent. Once the flight
attendants make the announcement that masks are no longer needed, **take
your mask off and return to your seat as quickly and safely as you
can.**]{.rendered_qtext}
