Richard, thanks very much for all the clarification. I will tell you
that I was Air Force Reserve at the time I was diagnosed. MS is not
\"commission-waiverable,\" so out the door I go. I\'m a disabled veteran
now. Who knew.

Anyway, I will have to take issue with the statement that
\"\[u\]npredictable problems with endurance, short term memory and
stress tolerance prohibit a 9-5, 40 hour job\" because that is simply
not true, and it is faulty thinking which may be causing some of your
angst.

Firstly, only you can tell you what you can and cannot do. Your employer
cannot tell you, \"you have MS so you can\'t do this job.\" That would
be a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Of course, that
doesn\'t apply to commissioned or non-commissioned military members, but
it does apply to DoD civilians.

It\'s up to you to say what you can and cannot do, and it seems like you
might be able to overcome some of your issues with a combination of
assistive aids that you provide, and accommodations that your employer
provides.

Before we get into your specific issues, you also have to understand
what type of MS you have. If you have a progressive form of the disease,
you will have to continually work at overcoming these issues. If you
have a relapsing form of the disease, these won\'t be an issue all the
time, just on occasion.

Let\'s see if we can muddle through some of these:

*My short-term memory is not good; I may make an appointment over the
phone and forget about it unless reminded within seconds after getting
off the phone. If I get stimuli from multiple things at one time, the
ability to process the information stops\-\-- driving in heavy traffic
is probably not a good idea.*

**Cognitive dysfunction** is a common symptom of MS, but it may not be a
symptom of its own; cognitive dysfunction can also be a secondary
symptom of other things such as aging, medications, depression, anxiety,
stress and fatigue. Ideally, you and your neurologist should talk about
your cognitive issues. You may need to consult with a specialists, such
as a neuropsychologist, a SLP (speech language pathologist), or
occupational therapist to diagnose the extent of the issues and to help
formulate some compensatory strategies and also some therapy to improve
congitive function (with practice, it can improve somewhat).

*General physical weakness and becoming tired too quickly is a problem.*

This is, by far, the most common symptom of MS. Almost everyone with MS
experiences fatigue in one form or another. This isn\'t just your
garden-variety tired; it has its own name: MS Lassitude. Have you ever
woken up tired? That\'s a rough way to start your day. But because it is
so common, there has been a great deal of focus on it, and lots of ways
to combat it. The MS Society talks about the following interventions for
MS-related fatigue:

- Occupational therapy to simplify tasks at work and home.
- Physical therapy to learn energy-saving ways of walking (with or
  without assistive devices) and performing other daily tasks, and to
  develop a regular exercise program.
- Sleep regulation, which might involve treating other MS symptoms that
  interfere with sleep (e.g., spasticity, urinary problems) and using
  sleep medications on a short-term basis.
- Psychological interventions, such as stress management, relaxation
  training, membership in a support group, or psychotherapy.
- Heat management --- strategies to avoid overheating and to cool down.
- Medications --- [[amantadine hydrochloride
  (Symmetrel®)](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e69066&url=http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Treating-MS/Medications/Amantadine){.external_link

  (Provigil®)](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e437cd&url=http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Treating-MS/Medications/Provigil){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
  qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container} --- are the
  most commonly prescribed. While neither is approved specifically by
  the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of
  MS-related fatigue, each has demonstrated some benefit in clinical
  trials. The most recent trial of modafinil, however, reported no
  difference between modafinil and placebo in relieving fatigue.

*Different physical symptoms come and go without warning, usually
exacerbated by heat or stress. Some days there are significant specific
physical problems, particularly in the summer.*

You may not be aware of this, but before the MRI became the go-to tool
to diagnose MS, the previous go-to tool was the *hot tub*. Dunk the
patient in the hot tub for 15-20 minutes and their symptoms should get
worse. Remove the patient from the tub and cool them down, and the
symptoms should subside. This, at the time, was a fair indication that
the patient had MS.

It is well known that heat exacerbates MS symptoms. Management of heat
is a big issue, then, with MS patients. There are a variety of cooling
devices which exist on the market which employ ice packs in
specially-designed clothing (vests, wrist and neck bands, etc) which can
help to keep the body cool and combat heat-related symptoms.
Additionally, there are organizations that can help defray some of the
costs of these devices; check with your local MS organization (the local
chapter of the National MS Society or the MS Association of America) to
find their cooling vest program information.

It is also well known that stress can exacerbate MS symptoms. As we
discussed with fatigue, these are all interconnected: heat and stress
can cause fatigue and other physical symptoms to appear. Therefore, some
of the things we already discussed (occupational and physical therapy,
exercise, sleep regulation, stress management, etc) are extremely
important in not only controlling the disease symptoms, but also in
living healthy with a lifelong medical condition.

I think it\'s important to stress that MS is *life-changing*, not
*life-ending*. You can continue to do the things you love when you have
MS. You simply must be careful to control the triggers that cause MS
flare-ups and exacerbations.
