**Why don\'t the Democrats capitalize on all the lies Trump said in his
SOTU?**

Oh, don't worry, they'll try.

*But at this point, who will believe them?*

First it was Russia, then it was Ukraine, and the final nail in the
coffin is the failed partisan impeachment. Trump beat them all. And he
came out of it with better public opinion than when he was elected.

I can remember Jerry Nadler saying, clear as a bell, that he was in
possession of actual evidence that proved Trump and Russia. Lie.

I can remember Adam Schiff spinning a bard's tale about Trump's phone
call, on the record, in the House, to make a point. Another lie.

They literally discredit themselves every time they speak.
