Charges? First, the only charge I can think of is "false reporting," and
it is unclear whether or not this applies to the police. Second, you're
going to have a tough row to hoe to prove that the police knew facts
other than what they entered into the report. Third, why would they lie?
There's no real reason I can think of that they would want to
deliberately falsify a report that they submit.

Falsifying a report can only hurt them, as it would be more in violation
of department policy than law, which means that they can be
administratively punished (or potentially lose their jobs) if the
falsification is found to be deliberate for some reason.
