Yes, the President can indeed obstruct justice. Clinton did it when he
tried to influence potential witnesses to not tell the truth. Nixon did
it; he paid hush money, he told people to lie, he destroyed evidence.

It is indeed possible for presidents to obstruct justice.

Has Trump done it? Did he obstruct justice by firing Comey?

The short answer is **no**.

The President has the authority to fire the director of the FBI under
Article II. It cannot be obstruction of justice if you are exercising
your power under the Constitution, *even if you do it specifically to
avoid your own prosecution!*

Case in point: George H.W. Bush did it. He pardoned Casper Weinberger to
forestall the investigation that would have eventually implicated him.
No one talked about obstruction of justice then.

Trump *could have* done the same thing here! ***He could have pardoned
Mike Flynn!*** He has the power to pardon Flynn, but he chose not to. If
Flynn was pardoned, he wouldn't have to cooperate with the Special
Counsel. ***But he didn't!*** That alone should tell you that there is
no obstruction of justice.
