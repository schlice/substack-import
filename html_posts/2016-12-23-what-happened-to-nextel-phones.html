Nextel and their iDEN network was purchased by Sprint in 2005.

In 2010, Sprint Nextel announced plans to decommission the Nextel iDEN
network. In June 2013, they decommissioned the iDEN network and began
deploying LTE equipment on the 800 MHz band that iDEN used to run on.

They still offer service on the Boost Mobile prepaid brand (which was
Nextel's old prepaid service), and they offer push-to-talk functionality
similar to Nextel using their Sprint Direct Connect service.
