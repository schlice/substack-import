Your other posters are spot-on. Generally, business regulations do not
have the power to close a business because of violations of
anti-discrimination laws. They can absolutely use violations of those
laws as a basis for filing lawsuits, which will eventually become so
costly that it will impact the business financially, rendering it unable
to stay open.
