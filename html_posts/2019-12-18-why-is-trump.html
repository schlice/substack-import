**Why is Trump's approval rising and support for impeachment dropping?**

Trump's approval is rising because he is accomplishing nearly everything
he set out to accomplish. The economy is booming. More people are
working now than ever before. More money is showing up in peoples'
paychecks. And Trump's policies are why.

Support for impeachment is dropping because people know that in order to
impeach, you need *broad, bipartisan approval* and clear and convincing
evidence that a crime which rises to the level of impeachment has taken
place. People are increasingly seeing that we have none of this.
