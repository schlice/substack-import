The difference in the eras that we were raised show the difference in
how to handle a non-deadly virus which, we thought, you only get once in
your lifetime and then you're done (except for shingles, ugh), before
and after the creation of a vaccine.

When I was young, when someone got chicken pox, moms would bring their
kids over and let them play together, so that they could all get it.
They'd colloquially call them "pox parties."

The chicken pox vaccine was released in 1995.

My kids all got the vaccine, none of them got chicken pox.

Original question:

People who were parents before 2000, how did you handle chicken pox in
your children? What would you do if you had an infant while another
child was infected?
