How people self-identify is non-physical. How people self-identify is
not how we determine who gets fundamental human rights.

People who self-identify as something which they are physically not are
still physically human. You remain a physical human, regardless of how
you self-identify.

Therefore, humans always retain fundamental human rights, because they
are always physically human, regardless of how they self-identify.
