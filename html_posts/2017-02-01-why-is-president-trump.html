There are so many emotions surrounding this issue, and there is such
mis-characterization of the order in the media and in social media, that
it's hard to separate the truth from the actual wording of the order
itself. So I'll give you the actual reasons behind the order, and
separate some of the facts from the hypocritical and hyperbolic
rhetoric.

Also note that the order was in several parts, and many of the parts of
the order are being conflated and mis-characterized. The first part of
the order is regarding immigrants and non-immigrants from seven Middle
Eastern countries. The second part of the order is regarding all
refugees, and the third part is regarding refugees from Syria. While
many characterizations about the orders have been given, the whole
purpose of the order is really only about ***vetting***. Vetting is what
we do when someone wants to come into this country, either as an
immigrant, a non-immigrant (a tourist), or a refugee. We contact the
originating country through diplomatic channels to get more information
about the person trying to come into this country. The originating
country gives us information about the person: are they who they claim
to be, what sorts of troubles have they gotten themselves into in their
source nation, have they participated in any terror-related activities,
etc. You know, trying to figure out whether or not the person is a good
guy or a bad guy.

Here's the details about the order, because you probably don't know:

1.  It imposes a **temporary** 90-day suspension on immigrants and
    non-immigrants (tourists) from seven Middle-Eastern countries: Iraq,
    Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. The media loves to
    mis-characterize this order as "seven majority Muslim countries"
    making this order appear to be about religion.\
    \
    **This order has nothing to do with religion.**\
    \
    If it did, then why are there at least 40 other "majority Muslim"
    countries which are *not* included on the list?\
    \
    When we vet people to grant visas, we contact the originating
    country to get that vetting information, as I explained above.
    *These seven countries give us* ***nothing****.* We have no
    information to go on in order to determine whether or not these
    people are even who they say they are! We can't even prove their
    identities. Previously, we just *let them in.* These seven countries
    are either in the middle of jihadist wars, being torn apart by
    jihadist violence, or are controlled by hostile, jihadist
    governments, and are entirely uncooperative with us. That's why they
    are on the list and other countries are not.\
    \
    So we are ***temporarily*** suspending immigration from these
    countries for 90 days. This gives us time to review whether or not
    we are getting anything from these countries at all, make sure we
    advise these countries what we need from them, and then decide
    whether or not we can proceed with continuing to allow immigration
    into this country from those nations. Maybe if they want to continue
    to allow people to leave their nation and become US citizens, they
    will start sharing information with us.\
    \
    Additionally, this order gives the Secretaries of State and Homeland
    Security the power to issue visas or other immigration benefits when
    it is in the national interest. So those translators from Iraq who
    risked their lives to help us? Already approved. And those
    green-card holders caught in transit? Already approved.\
    \
    We already know that terrorists are trying to infiltrate the ranks
    of immigrants and refugees. We know that terrorists from Somalia
    have already infiltrated the ranks of immigrants and have launched
    jihadist attacks right here in America, and have done so in Europe
    as well. Clearly, our current approach is inadequate.\
    \
    I do think the order went a little far in including green card
    holders, but let's be clear, it is **not unconstitutional.** While a
    green card holder may have already gone through many rounds of
    vetting, they are **not US citizens**. Green card or not, they have
    no **right** to enter this country at any time they choose. Only
    citizens can do that. Therefore, the ban can legally extend to them,
    and it is not unconstitutional. However, it does violate the spirit
    of the order, which is why it is being largely rolled back.
2.  The order **temporarily** stops refugee admissions for 120 days so
    we can improve the vetting process, and then caps the amount of
    refugees at 50,000 per year. ONLY 50,000? That's inhumane!!! Well
    hold up there over-reactor: 50,000 is right in between refugee
    admissions from Bush's two terms, and Obama's two terms. In 2002, we
    only admitted roughly 27,000 refugees. Obama, at his height, had the
    cap at 70,000. So Trump's 50,000 is a rough average between Bush and
    Obama, and he's improving security screening at the same time. If
    you are actually able to separate your emotions from your logic,
    this is actually a very middle-of-the-road approach.
3.  Finally, there is an indefinite hold on refugees from Syria until we
    can be sure that our vetting process is actually working. This is
    mostly a return to Obama's refugee policy on Syria from 2011
    to 2014. For all of you complaining that this is unprecedented,
    until 2016, this was actually the Obama administration's policy on
    Syrian refugees. In 2011, we let in exactly 29 refugees from Syria.
    2012? 31. In 2013, it was 36. 2014 saw 105, and in 2015, we let in
    1682 refugees. All with little to no vetting.

Finally, there's quite a lot of outrage over the directive to
"prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of
religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the
individual is a minority religion in the individual's country of
nationality." What this government legal-speak means is that when we do
start allowing refugees back in in a few months, people who are of
"minority religions" in the country from which they came may go to the
head of the line.

Whether or not there was religious profiling during the Obama
administration is certainly a matter for debate, but since this isn't a
debate (it's an answer), I'm simply going to focus on the actual order.
So does it violate the Constitution to use religion as a test to allow
refugees? Does it violate the law?

**No and no**.

In fact, the term "refugee," according to the law, means, "(A). Any
person who is outside of any country of such person's nationality ...
and who is unable or unwilling to return to ... that country because of
persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of ...
religion...". There are, of course, other things that could cause a fear
of persecution, but clearly, religion is one of them.

Therefore, it is right for us to determine whether or not religious
persecution is taking place in the country of the refugee's nationality,
and also determine if the person is fearful of returning because of
religious persecution. Determining if the person is part of the
religious minority is part of that vetting. If a person is claiming
religious persecution, we are well within our rights as a nation to
determine if that's true.

We know that terrorists are seeking to strike through the refugee
population. We know that they have already succeeded both here and
abroad. And you can read through the entire text of the order, and you
won't find a single reference in there to a Muslim ban. None. Zero. The
order isn't a betrayal of American values. As long as it is applied
correctly, it can be the start of new policies that protect our nation
and still allow for the preservation of national friendships and
cooperation, and still allow for us to be compassionate national
neighbors.

*(I do apologize, but because this is such a highly-charged emotional
issue for some, I am forced to disable comments. If you have a differing
opinion, you're welcome to answer the question yourself.)*
