**Content:** [Since you live in India, Intel would have to take you to
court in India. I\'m not sure how strong cybersquatting laws are in
India, so I can\'t comment on whether or not you have a chance of
winning there.\
\
But there are other avenues for Intel to pursue. The United Nations (in
which India is a member nation) has a copyright agency known as the
[[World Intellectual Property
Organization](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a7a03e&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Intellectual_Property_Organization){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}, which hears and settles
international disputes over cybersquatting. In 2007, the organization
said that 84% of the claims brought since 1999 were settled in the
complaining party\'s favor.\
\
Basically, world opinion is that cybersquatting is frowned upon, and the
squatter will only be refunded reasonable name acquisition costs.
However, if they end up filing lawsuit against you, you may also be
saddled with court costs, which would be much more than what you paid
for the domain name.]{.rendered_qtext}
