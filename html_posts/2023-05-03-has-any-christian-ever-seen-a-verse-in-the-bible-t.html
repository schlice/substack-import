The simple answer is **yes**, God's love for humans is unconditional.

Here's how we know: ***God always initiates love; His love is never a
response to us.*** That is precisely what makes it unconditional. If His
love was in response to us, that would mean that we would have to *do*
something to earn His love or to merit it. We would somehow have to
become *worthy* to receive His love. Or in different terms, we'd have to
get clean before we take a shower, or we'd have to get well before we
see the doctor.

But that's not the Biblical message. The clear message of the Gospel is
that God, motivated solely and unconditionally by His love, moved to
save people from their sin.

We can see it clearly in 1 John 4:9--10:

> This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son
> into the world that we might live through him. This is love: not that
> we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning
> sacrifice for our sins

In other words, we can love Him because *He loved us first.*

You can also see it in Ephesians 2:4--5:

> But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made
> us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions---it is
> by grace you have been saved

We were **dead** in our sin. And when you're dead, you have no
capability to initiate *anything*. It is only God's great love for us
that *made us alive* with Christ. We were dead; we alone could do
nothing. It is only God's love that could place us in a position to
which we could accept His saving grace.

Now, don't be confused by this. Just because His love is unconditional
(meaning we don't have to do anything to earn His love) does not mean
that He saves everyone.

> And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into
> eternal life. --- Matthew 25:46

It also does not mean that God will never discipline His children.
Ignoring God's love and rejecting the gift of His son will subject us to
His eternal wrath.

> For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness
> and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the
> truth. --- Romans 1:18 ESV

Yes, God loves all of humanity. But he loves Christians in a different
way than he loves non-Christians. Christians are *saved* because they
believe in Christ. God's unconditional love for all people *should*
motivate a person to belief in Christ.

TL;DR: Salvation is *conditional*. God's love for us is *not*.
