NORAD is required to identify the missile within **TWO MINUTES** after
it is launched, so the Pentagon knows about that launch as soon as we
do. As the missile gains altitude and we gain ground-based locks on it
as well as satellite locks, we get more data on the type of missile
(thus we know its range) and we gain its trajectory which gives us a
"threat fan" overlay on the screen which shows us where it could
potentially land. That takes about **FIVE MINUTES**

Unfortunately, I don't have the unclassified mock-ups of what a threat
fan looks like, but suffice it to say that if the threat fan crosses the
ADIZ around North America, it is counted as a **threat launch** and the
National Command Authority is notified.

Five minutes.

If missile flight time from Russia is around 30 minutes, that gives us
25 minutes to evacuate the President from the White House to Joint Base
Andrews (the 1st Helicopter Squadron sits alert at Joint Base Andrews to
perform this exact function) and place him on the National Airborne
Operations Center (formerly known as the National Emergencey Airborne
Command Post: the "Kneecap"), which can all be done within that 25
minute timeframe. So the President will indeed be safe.

If, for some reason, the President cannot get out of the White House,
there is a secure bunker beneath the facility that he can shelter in.

The National Command Authority is the President, the Vice President, and
the Secretary of Defense. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is
also accounted for since he can issue the same orders to the military.
