US presidents have never worn military uniforms. You may be confusing
several presidents who were military officers before becoming president.
While some may have worn their retired uniforms to certain commemorative
functions, they did not have active military rank while retired.

Commander-in-Chief is not a rank. The CinC is not the highest ranking
member of the military. He is not *in* the military. He is *above* the
military. Our military is 100% controlled by civilians.

This is why presidents do not wear military uniforms.
