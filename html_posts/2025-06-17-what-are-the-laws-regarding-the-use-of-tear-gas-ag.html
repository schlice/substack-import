This question is way too broad to be able to answer with any level of
usefulness.

Are there violent agitators or paid Democrat full-time protesters mixed
in with the peaceful protesters causing trouble? If you are at a protest
and you are peaceful, you have no intention of causing harm, and
violence breaks out, I suggest you get the heck out of there. Police
will use crowd control to quell the violence, and you could
inadvertently be caught up in that. There is no law which says that if
there are peaceful protesters in a crowd which becomes violent that
crowd control measures cannot be deployed.

In other words, **don't associate with violent agitators**. If they are
there, you should not be there.
