**What has the COVID task force done to try and stem the ten days of
100,000 plus new cases and hospitalizations at record levels across the
United States?**

What they should have been doing: ***change your manner of thinking***.

We shouldn't be trying to prevent every infection, because not every
case is the same. And we know that the infection is far worse for
certain members of the population: **those over 70 years old**. For
everyone else, the virus is no more deadly than the flu. For children,
the flu is actually *more* dangerous than COVID.

Remember "flatten the curve?" That was our goal. Not long into the
progression of the disease around the country, we pretty quickly
realized that we were never going to overrun our ICU capacity, and using
ventilators as treatment has long since been abandoned for all but the
most critical cases. So we have indeed "flattened the curve." We have
indeed ensured that we will not be overwhelming the ability of our
medical community to respond to the disease.

Additionally, our therapies, our treatments, and our approach to helping
those infected have improved dramatically. Visiting the ICU with COVID
now gives you a 9 out of 10 chance of going home, whereas in the early
stages of the virus, that chance was 2 out of 10.

Finally, you absolutely cannot ignore the catastrophic impacts of the
lockdown, and I'm not talking about the economic impact.

We need to focus on protecting the most vulnerable, but then allowing
everyone else to resume their lives.

So what should we be doing? Re-educating the public about the **true**
dangers of COVID.
