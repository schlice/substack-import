Sadly, you can\'t write such a book, since the cause of MS is currently
unknown, so similarly, there is no cure. Your book would be categorized
as science fiction.

I\'ve put this in multiple answers, but I\'ll say it again: **if you
"had MS\" and you "did something\" which "cured your MS," you didn\'t
have MS. Period.** You had a disease which mimicked MS. Actually,
that\'s the other way around. MS mimics many diseases, since there are
no symptoms in MS which are unique to MS. Nevertheless, you had a
disease which looked a lot like MS, and you were misdiagnosed. It is,
really, that simple.

I hate to sound harsh, but that is the simple truth.
