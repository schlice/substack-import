**Content:** [As long as gas-powered engines remain, manual
transmissions will remain. Gearheads (or as you call them in the UK,
petrol heads) will insist on it. Just ask Jeremy Clarkson, who believes
a car just isn\'t a car if it doesn\'t have a \"proper gearbox.\" Even
some flappy-paddle manuals are more electronic then electromechanical.
Supercars with flappy-paddle shifters are electromechanical. Mid-level
sedans with \"auto-manual\" transmissions are just electronic; not a
proper gearbox, so to speak.]{.rendered_qtext}
