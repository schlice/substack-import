**If Judge Roy Moore wins the election, what will be the impact on
women's rights in the USA? Will women keep stepping forward with their
accusations?**

I suspect that the tide of accusers will continue, as more and more
women feel empowered to step forward and make their accusations.

If the state of Alabama chooses to elect Judge Moore, I feel that this
will have limited impact on this tide of accusers.

The question seems to imply that if Moore is not removed from Congress,
that women won't feel empowered to step forward with their accusations.

Which leads me to believe that women ***want*** to see men lose their
jobs and their life's work simply from accusations, and that the "only
acceptable outcome" for a man accused of sexual impropriety is to lose
his job.

I submit to you a different tack: instead of this tide of accusers
forcing men to lose their jobs, let's do something meaningful: maybe
it's time to extend the statute of limitations on rape, or get rid of it
altogether. Isn't prosecuting a rape as important to public safety as
prosecuting a murder? Maybe it's time to get some meaningful affirmative
consent laws passed. Maybe instead of men blathering on about how they
respect women, maybe they should really make an effort to ***prove
it.***
