Interesting. A little history:

> In its 1987 decision in *South Dakota v. Dole*, which arguably remains
> the leading case regarding the use of the federal government's
> conditional spending power, the Court held that legislation enacted
> pursuant to the Spending Clause must be in pursuit of the "general
> welfare." In addition, the Dole Court held that any conditions
> attached to the receipt of federal funds must: (1) be unambiguously
> established so that recipients can knowingly accept or reject them;
> (2) be germane to the federal interest in the particular national
> projects or programs to which the money is directed; (3) not violate
> other provisions of the Constitution, such as the First Amendment or

In other words, it's at least legally questionable whether or not the
Federal government can use spending restrictions to impermissibly coerce
states.

Original question:

If the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, what funds does the
president have the discretion to withhold from states to pressure the
decision one way or another?
