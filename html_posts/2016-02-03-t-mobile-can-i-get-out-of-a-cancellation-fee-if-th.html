Technically, no. Your contract doesn\'t have any provisions for
usage-based discounts for breaking your contract.

That said, if you follow [[Tj
Timberlake](https://www.quora.com/profile/Tj-Timberlake)]{.qlink_container}\'s
advice and call Customer Service and ask them for the Loyalty Department
and explain the situation, they may be able to help. In fact, they\'re
the only group with the power to help.
