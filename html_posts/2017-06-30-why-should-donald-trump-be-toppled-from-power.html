First of all, he's not "in power." He didn't "take power" like a
dictator. He doesn't "wield control" like a dictator. Therefore, he
can't be "toppled" from power.

Despite the media's incessant ramblings about Russia, Trump was
democratically elected. There is no question about that. He followed all
the rules of the election process, and he won. He did not "seize" power
unlawfully. He is not holding his office unlawfully.

So should he be "toppled" from power? What does that even mean? Do you
want to storm the gates of the Bastille and drag him to the guillotine?
You may *want* to do that, but since the nation's democratic system
still appears to be in full working order, perhaps your time would be
better spent on working up, oh I don't know, **better ideas** than the
ones he has. He won because people liked his ideas better, not because
of racism or xenophobia or Russia or any other excuse you can make. They
simply liked his ideas better than hers. Time to get over it and concede
that your candidate *sucked*.

**The truth of the matter is they all sucked. According to the voters,
he sucked less.**

Maybe if you come up with some better ideas, you (or your candidate) can
beat him in four years, at which time he will "self-topple" as he
voluntarily cedes power to the new winner.

We have had civil turnovers of power in this country for hundreds of
years. In four or eight years, we will have another civil turnover of
power.

He doesn't need to be toppled. He needs to be beaten in the arena of
ideas.
