In order for anyone (regardless of political party) to care, Mueller's
investigation needs to find conclusive evidence that ***candidate***
Trump worked directly, or through his surrogates, with Russia in an
attempt to influence the outcome of the election.

To this point, **no such evidence exists.** And until such evidence
exists, this is a non-starter. This whole thing is a giant waste of
time, money, and attention.
