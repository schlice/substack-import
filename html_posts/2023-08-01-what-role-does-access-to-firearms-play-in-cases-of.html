This is an interesting question, and a very specific one.

Basically, the only research we have shows that, unsurprisingly, homes
where firearms exist have higher rates of suicide, and higher likelihood
of homicide, using a firearm.[\[1\]](#tQNOT){#cite-tQNOT
.citation_link}[\[2\]](#DWWpF){#cite-DWWpF .citation_link}

I almost think that goes without saying, but if there are guns in a
house, there is an increased risk of those guns being used for either
homicide or suicide. Homes where guns are not present have a decreased
risk of homicide or suicide which involves a firearm.

Note that there was no correlation made between a home with firearms and
***non***-firearm homicide or suicide. Therefore, we cannot tell if this
is a *correlation* or a *causation*. Remember, firearms make killing
*easier*, they don't make killing *possible*.

What can we do about this? There are a few things.

- Better mental health services. Suicide prevention is the number one
  thing we can do to stop this, because if someone is committed to
  suicide and/or homicide, the presence or absence of a firearm will not
  deter them. This is a cry for help, and we need to do a much better
  job of answering that cry.
- Safe storage laws. Look, we know there is an incompatibility between
  accessibility of a firearm and being able to rapidly employ that
  firearm to use to defend your home. But I think that home safes have
  come far enough technologically that they qualify as safe storage, yet
  allow for rapid access. We need to do better in both providing public
  funding so people can have safe storage, but advance the safe storage
  technology to the point where it is both rapidly accessible, and still
  safe.\
  \
  We must be careful here though, simply mandating safe storage will be
  found to be unconstitutional, so this must be done gradually, with
  public funding, in order to not infringe on the right to keep and bear
  arms. Make no mistake: **the desire to curtail murder-suicides is not
  justification enough to infringe on a Constitutional right.**
- Smarter gun owners. If you know that someone in your home is suicidal,
  you had better remove access to firearms from them. Lock them up. Be
  smart about being a gun owner.
