Yes, this is permitted. But you might want to let your fellow employees
know that your employer is not doing everything in its power to protect
them.

Employers are required to create a safe workplace, and bringing in
employees who have been exposed to COVID-19 during the time period when
they are ostensibly *most contagious* is reckless at best, and criminal
at worst.

But is it allowed? Sure it is. It's just not very *safe* for everyone
else.

So go to work, keep your mask on, and keep your distance as best as you
can.

And maybe look for a better job.
