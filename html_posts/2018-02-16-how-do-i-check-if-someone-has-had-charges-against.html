**How do I check if someone has had charges against him or if he is a
pedophile?**

This is two separate questions.

It's not necessarily easy to see if any particular person has ever had
criminal charges filed against them. It's much easier to see if someone
has been ***convicted*** of a crime. Once you've been convicted in
court, it becomes public record. You can simply call the court which
services the case, and you can find out. There are many public databases
which also contain conviction records. Go ahead and search Google, I
dare you.

But records of other things, such as dismissed/acquitted charges or
pending charges are not universal from state to state. You may not be
able to reliably find that information.

On the other hand, finding out if someone is a convicted pedophile is
much easier. Anyone convicted as a sex offender must register on the
[[sex offender
registry](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=055c09&url=https://www.nsopw.gov/?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport%3D1){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="nsopw.gov"}]{.qlink_container} and can very easily be
searched.
