I\'m going to add another voice to the discussion and look at this from
the other side.

As the discussion has shown, addicts are not criminals. This is
something that we have known for quite some time. So what are they? If
they\'re not criminals, are they sick? Is addiction a disease, or a
choice? Up until very recently, the medical community has not classified
addiction as a disease. Addicts were not patients, and their behaviors
were not related to disease; they were simply bad actors. This left the
problem of dealing with addicts to the state and to the criminal justice
system, meaning that addicts went to jail.

Recently there has been an explosion in understanding of the brain and
people are learning that the mechanisms that control choice in the brain
do not function correctly in the brain of the addict. It is a disease of
the brain, and addicts should be *patients*, not *prisoners*. Their bad
behavior is a symptom of a disease, not an indication that an addict is
a bad person.

So is addiction a disease, or a choice? It is a \"disease of choice,\"
where the mechanisms that allow a person to make rationally-guided
choices fail to work correctly, and the person makes bad choices. The
disease does not manifest itself until the person actually \"chooses\"
to take a drink, a pill, or a fix. Once they do, the disease manifests
itself and the person irrationally continues using the substance,
unimpeded by logic or reason.

So there is choice involved, but after that first choice, the disease
takes over, and rational choice goes out the window.
