<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I\'m going to add another voice to the discussion and look at this from<br>the other side.<br><br>As the discussion has shown, addicts are not criminals. This is<br>something that we have known for quite some time. So what are they? If<br>they\'re not criminals, are they sick? Is addiction a disease, or a<br>choice? Up until very recently, the medical community has not classified<br>addiction as a disease. Addicts were not patients, and their behaviors<br>were not related to disease; they were simply bad actors. This left the<br>problem of dealing with addicts to the state and to the criminal justice<br>system, meaning that addicts went to jail.<br><br>Recently there has been an explosion in understanding of the brain and<br>people are learning that the mechanisms that control choice in the brain<br>do not function correctly in the brain of the addict. It is a disease of<br>the brain, and addicts should be *patients*, not *prisoners*. Their bad<br>behavior is a symptom of a disease, not an indication that an addict is<br>a bad person.<br><br>So is addiction a disease, or a choice? It is a \"disease of choice,\"<br>where the mechanisms that allow a person to make rationally-guided<br>choices fail to work correctly, and the person makes bad choices. The<br>disease does not manifest itself until the person actually \"chooses\"<br>to take a drink, a pill, or a fix. Once they do, the disease manifests<br>itself and the person irrationally continues using the substance,<br>unimpeded by logic or reason.<br><br>So there is choice involved, but after that first choice, the disease<br>takes over, and rational choice goes out the window.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
