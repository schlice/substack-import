Humidity is usually accompanied by heat, and it is the heat that affects
me more than the humidity.

When I get hot, I start to get tired faster. if I allow myself to
overheat, it usually means that by the end of the day, I am too tired to
continue doing what everybody else is doing. I have gotten so overheated
in the past that I have literally passed out, fallen asleep in my
clothes, and woke up the next day wondering what happened.

and this is a different kind of tired, it\'s not the same kind of tired
where you just want to go to bed. This is a deep, neurological tired,
where your brain just turns to mush and you can\'t really function
effectively. The last time this happened to me, I had to have somebody
else drive the car because I was in no condition to drive.

This is a symptom of MS called "MS lassitude" and I can tell you from
experience that it is a real thing.
