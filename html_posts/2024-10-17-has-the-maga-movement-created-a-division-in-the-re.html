The MAGA movement is a symptom, not the cause, of the division. Trump
himself is the cause of the division.

I see the Republican party now splintered into a variety of factions,
but it all is happening specifically about Trump. There are three main
groups of Republicans when it comes to feelings about Trump:

MAGA Republicans\
**MOST bog-standard Republicans\**
Never Trumpers

These are ranked from *most* sycophantic/sympathetic to Trump to *least*
sycophantic/sympathetic to Trump. Let's look at each of them one at a
time:

- **MAGA Republicans**. These are the guys wearing the "'Mericuns for
  Trump" shirts and the girls wearing the "He can grab this pussy
  anytime he wants" shirts. They *love* Trump. They've completely
  discounted his character flaws. They've painted their cars with images
  of Trump. They have MAGA flags and hats and signs all over their
  houses. Some of them believe he represents some sort of savior. These
  guys are fringe Republicans.
- **Most bog-standard Republicans.** This is where the vast majority of
  Republicans land on the question of Trump. Yeah, he's a flawed
  candidate. He's a flawed man. He's definitely not perfect. But most
  Republicans aren't voting for him because they think he's totally
  awesome. They're putting *principles above personalities* and voting
  for the candidate who they believe can do more good for the country
  than the other flawed candidate. This is the vast majority of
  Republicans.
- **Never Trumpers**. These are people who still hold the same ideas
  about the Republican party, but are so off-put by the man himself and
  his particular character flaws that they cannot, in good conscience,
  cast a vote for him. They're not going to vote for Harris, but they're
  also not going to ever vote for any ticket which includes Trump. They
  would rather literally throw their vote away on a third party
  candidate than vote for Trump. These are also a small fringe of the
  Party. This, by the way, is the part of the Republican party who
  "actively oppose Trump and MAGA."
