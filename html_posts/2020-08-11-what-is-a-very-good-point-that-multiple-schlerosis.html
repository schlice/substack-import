**What is a good point to tell someone that multiple Schlerosis is not
my fault?**

Multiple Sclerosis is not a disease you can "catch." You didn't do or
not do anything that increased your own risk of developing the disease.
It is an *autoimmune disease*. This means your immune system is
*malfunctioning* and it is attacking healthy cells.

While we don't know the exact mechanism that induces this immune
response, we do know some risk factors that may indicate an increased
chance of developing the disease. We know this through *epidemiology*,
the study of disease patterns.

**SEX:** Females are two to three times more likely to develop MS than
males. Scientists believe that one\'s tendency to develop MS therefore
has some hormonal connection.

**FAMILY HISTORY:** Statistics show that the chance of the average
person in the United States developing MS is about 1 in 750. But close
(first-degree) relatives of people with MS, such as children, siblings
or non-identical twins, have a higher chance, anywhere from one in 100
to one in 40. It\'s not all genetic, though, and you can see this
through the \"identical twin\" example. If one identical twin has MS,
the other twin (who has the identical gene structure as the twin) has
only a 1 in 4 chance of developing MS. If it were all genetic, the
unaffected twin would have a 100% chance of developing MS instead of the
25% chance they exhibit today.

**ETHNICITY:** MS is more common among Caucasians (particularly those of
northern European ancestry) than other ethnic groups, and is almost
unheard of in some populations, such as Inuit, Yakutes, Hutterites,
Hungarian Romani, Norwegian Lapps, Australian Aborigines, and New
Zealand Maoris.

**GEOGRAPHY:** MS occurs with greatest frequency in higher latitudes
(above 40Â° latitude) away from the equator, than in lower latitudes,
closer to the equator. This may have something to do with vitamin D
production in the skin, and the vitamin\'s prophylactic effect on the
development of MS. The exact details about vitamin D\'s involvement with
the prevention of MS, however, is still unclear. Moving from one
geographic area to another seems to alter a person\'s risk of developing
MS. Studies show that families and their children will assume the new
risk level (higher or lower) of the area to which they move. Those who
move before the age of 15 generally take on the new risk themselves.
Those who move after the age of 15 may not see the new risk appear until
the next generation.

**INFECTIOUS TRIGGER:** Scientists have been searching for years for an
infectious agent that might trigger the MS disease process. While many
different viruses have been suggested, including rabies, herpes simplex
virus, measles, corona virus (other than COVID-19), canine distemper
virus, HTLV-1, Epstein-Barr virus, among others, none has yet been
confirmed. Chlamydia pneumoniae, a bacteria which 90% of the population
has been exposed to over their lifetime, has also been suggested but
never proven. Although no trigger has yet been identified, most MS
experts believe that some infectious agent is involved in initiating the
disease process.
