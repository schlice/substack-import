The idea here is not that the manufacturer was complicit in the murder.
The idea is to make it too costly to produce firearms in America,
because litigation costs from all of the victims' families from every
shooting in America will sue the manufacturer of the gun that killed
their loved one, thus destroying the gun industry by using the hammer of
the justice system. Ideally, she'd like to destroy the gun manufacturing
industry in America.

Of course, none of these lawsuits hold any merit. They are simply
enacted to burden the gun manufacturer with added legal costs so that it
becomes impractical to produce firearms.

It's very similar to SLAPP (Strategic Lawsuit Against Public
Participation) lawsuits. The plaintiff didn't hope to win. The plaintiff
only hoped to pressure the defendant enough to abandon whatever it was
they were doing that the plaintiff found objectionable; usually it was
publicly discussing something unpleasant about the plaintiff. Usually,
mounting legal costs were enough to dissuade defendants and get them to
stop talking about whatever unpopular thing it was that the plaintiff
didn't like. And prosecuitng SLAPP plaintiffs was hard because you don't
want to deny real good-faith claims by making anti-SLAPP legislation too
broad.
