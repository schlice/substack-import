**How do you get justice if the statute of limitations has expired in a
sexual assault (non rape) on a minor case?**

Ah, I see you want "justice," eh? Well then, I have a few questions:

- What is "justice?" How is it different from "fairness?"
- Why do we have a statute of limitations?
- Why can't we bring a charge after the statute of limitations has
  expired?
- Finally, are you sure you want "justice," or maybe do you want
  something else?

So first, let's look at this concept of "justice." Justice means *to
deliver a consequence which is just*. Notice that it does not say "to
deliver a consequence which is fair" or "to deliver a consequence which
punishes someone." It says "to deliver a consequence which is **just**."
What does that mean? Let me illustrate with an example. One of my three
children does something awesome, deserving of a treat, which he
receives. One of my other children sees this and says, "Hey, I didn't
get a treat! That's not fair!" I say, "Are you sure you want everything
to be fair? Because that means that I'll have to be fair in everything,
both good and bad. Which means the next time he does something wrong,
you'll also receive his punishment, because that's fair. Does that sound
like something you want?" Of course, they say no. I conclude: "So are
you sure you want what's fair? Or do you instead want what's *just*?
That everyone gets exactly what they deserve?"

My children just learned the difference between *justice* and *fairness*
(and now you did, too).

So is it *just* to have a statute of limitations, after which you cannot
bring a charge for a specific crime? To answer that question, you must
answer whether or not it is just to allow a trial to take place when we
have admittedly poor or fuzzy memories of an incident, when physical
evidence has degraded to such a degree that it becomes virtually
unusable to prove or disprove anything. To proceed to trial with such
evidence, would this be *just*? It might, but it certainly is not
*fair*. Fairness in trials means that everyone has an *equal
opportunity* to receive justice. Is it fair to have a trial 20 years
after an incident and expect justice to be served in the same way as it
would be served only two weeks after an incident? It is clearly unfair,
to all parties involved. Therefore, we can say that it would be *unjust*
to allow a trial to proceed with such weak evidence. It is unfair
because it does not provide an equal opportunity to receive justice
under the law.

If you're reading this and thinking to yourself, "Yeah, but after X
amount of time (and after the statute of limitations has expired), the
guy gets away with it! Someone has to pay!" then you're probably not
looking for *justice*. Instead, you're looking for "an eye for an eye,"
you're looking for "a pound of flesh," you're looking for someone to pay
for what has happened to you. You are, instead, looking for
*retribution*, not *justice*. If you are looking for justice, then it is
just that a trial not proceed after the statute of limitations has
expired, and **justice is indeed served**. It always irks me when an
accused killer is found not guilty of murder and the family gets in
front of the cameras and says that "justice was not served." They don't
want justice. They want retribution. They want someone to pay for what
happened. They don't actually want to see "justice" done.

So to answer your question: **How do you get justice if the statute of
limitations has expired in a sexual assault (non rape) on a minor
case?** You understand that if this much time has elapsed since the
incident, then justice has indeed been served, as the appropriate
outcome at this time in this case has taken place: there will be no
criminal trial. That is justice: everyone gets exactly what they
deserve. And even defendants deserve to have a fair trial. And if you
can't have a fair trial, then it is just that no trial be held.

Maybe you should be asking how you get **closure** and how you can stop
dwelling on it and move on after such an incident instead of how you get
**justice**. That's a whole different question, and you don't ask it of
people who comment on the law. The law deals with justice. Counselors
and psychologists deal with closure.
