You're right. They're totally lying. The protests paid off! They didn't
want Trump to become a king. And when I woke up this morning, I found
that Trump is still not a king.

So...job well done, protesters! You succeeded! Trump is still not a
king!

So you can probably see by my credential that I'm going to take personal
offense at that.

I'm not going to address your remarks other than to say the entire
purpose of the military is to create and maintain a country where you
don't get arrested by Gestapo troops and beheaded in a quiet corner of
the middle of nowhere for actually posting what you did.

So count yourself lucky that the military exists, because if they
didn't, your freedom wouldn't either.
