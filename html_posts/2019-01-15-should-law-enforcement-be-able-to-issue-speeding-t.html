**Should law enforcement be able to issue speeding tickets based on
mobile or car GPS data?**

Issuing speeding tickets based on vehicle GPS data would require a lot
of things we don't currently have:

- All cars would have to record GPS speed all the time. The driver would
  have to be unable to turn it off.
- The data would have to be proven to be accurate, or at least as
  accurate as current speed recording devices like RADAR and LIDAR.
- It would have to be proven that the data can't be *altered* by the
  operator, and even if it could, such a practice would have to be made
  illegal (like the difficulty and illegality in changing your car's
  odometer)
- The speed history of the vehicle would need to be instantly accessible
  wirelessly to any officer at any time, when they stop a vehicle they
  think is speeding.
- After I typed the last bullet, I was thinking about how an officer
  would establish reasonable suspicion to stop a vehicle if the vehicle
  has the speed and not the officer. To that end, the vehicle would have
  to continually broadcast its GPS data to every nearby officer,
  probably using some form of network uplink. And similar to altering
  the GPS data, it would be illegal to disable the wireless broadcast of
  the vehicle's speed. The officer would see a map on his screen, with
  all of the nearby vehicles plotted on it, along with their speeds. I
  mean, if you have the GPS data, you can plot the car on the map. This
  presents a *huge* privacy challenge. Even though the vehicle isn't
  identified by its GPS data, it is at least theoretically possible to
  track *one* car.

This last bullet is probably going to be the biggest sticking point to
implementing a system that allows officers to give you tickets using GPS
speed data. It's just too *Big Brother* to be something that society
will accept. I think sticking with the current process of having the
*officer* determine your speed, rather than your *car* ratting you out
to the cops, is the best bet.
