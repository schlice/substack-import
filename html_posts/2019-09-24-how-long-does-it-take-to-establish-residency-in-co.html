**How long does it take to establish residency in Colorado once you move
there?**

Residency in any state (including Colorado) occurs when you *arrive* in
a state and *state your intention* to live in that state.
Congratulations, you're a state resident.

Generally, *proof* of residency will consist of something you retain to
show that you actually do mean to fulfill your intention to stay here,
like a utility bill or a rental agreement.

You'll need one of those when you go get your license. You have 30 days
to switch your license to Colorado, and you have 90 days to transfer
your registration for your car. You can even [[start the transfer
process

Residency **for** **in-state tuition purposes** is completely different
and usually requires you being a state resident for a period of time,
either 6 or 12 months.
