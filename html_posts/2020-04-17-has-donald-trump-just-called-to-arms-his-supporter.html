**Has Donald Trump just called to arms his supporters against the
Democrat governor in Virginia?**

It does seem that way, doesn't it.

Liberate Virginia? 2nd Amedment under siege? My God, the man is calling
for **armed insurrection!**

But then, you look at his tweet in *context*, vis-a-vis, the rest of his
feed:

Oh, I see, he's telling people to liberate their states from those crazy
Democrat governors. But then why the extra plug in Virginia? Because
Trump heard Virginia and he went, "Oh yeah, that's where that whole
brouhaha with the gun laws happened and they almost mobilized the
National Guard over it. I'll remind them that I still support their 2nd
Amendment rights"

...without considering the optics

...which he rarely does.

As always, Hanlon's Razor applies, and you should always begin any
analysis of Trump with a liberal application of it.
