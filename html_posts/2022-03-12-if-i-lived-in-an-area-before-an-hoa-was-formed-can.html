If the HOA was formed after you purchased your house, you cannot be
compelled to join it. The only way to make the HOA mandatory is to get
100% of the homeowners to agree. Normally, this is accomplished by the
developer, before the houses are sold, since the developer controls all
the lots at that time.

If you are not subject to the HOA because you never joined it, you can
tell them to go kick rocks. You don't pay dues to them so they can't
fine you. They have no control over your property. They cannot place a
lien on your property for failing to pay their fines.

They could try to sue you, but they'd lose badly.

Just ignore them. Let them make the first move. But make sure you know
which lawyer you're going to call if they do try any legal shenanigans.

(EDIT) In actuality, there is a process by which a mandatory HOA can be
formed after you buy your house, but it is a long process, it is not
cheap, and where it has happened, the homeowners who did not vote for it
(and actually campaigned against it) have won temporary injunctions from
enforcement activities by the newly-formed mandatory HOA.

For example, in Texas, you need a minimum of three homeowners to form a
property owner's association which encompasses all of the properties in
a given subdivision. Once the POA is formed, they can petition the court
to add ***covenant restrictions*** to the extents of the property
covered by the POA. 100% homeowner approval is not required. I forget
what the percentage is, but it's not 100%.

The upshot is that a mandatory HOA can indeed be formed after you buy
your property, but it takes years to accomplish. In at least one court
case, a homeowner successfully fought off a HOA which was formed after
he bought his house, but even that process took years and was similarly
not cheap.

Original question:

If I lived in an area before an HOA was formed, can they do anything
legally if I don\'t follow their petty rules?
