title: "Right-leaning people, should Republicans run on a COMPLETE (other than complications) ban on abortion (like Texas Legislature), or should we choose a more reasonable option like abortion RESTRICTIONS, rather than banning from point of conception?"

*Politically speaking,* in today's climate, a complete pro-life stance
is unworkable. The public feeling for rape victims precludes "forcing"
them to continue their unwanted pregnancy, so the platform actually ends
up being "pro-life with a few exceptions."

*However, if you frame it correctly,* the pro-life position is a
workable platform. To date, no one has done so. To frame it correctly,
you must look at the argument from an **equal rights** view. If you are
to claim that everyone has equal rights, you must logically include
unborn babies in that group. A baby has as much right to life as its
mother. The mother's rights and the baby's rights are equal. No one's
rights "trump" anyone else's rights. The rights compare equally, in all
cases. Rights always compare equally in every other case of rights as
they are listed in the Bill of Rights, why suddenly in this case does a
person not have the right to life because of an intersection with
someone else's rights?

This means that **bodily autonomy has limits**. And the limit of the
mother's bodily autonomy is at the fetus. The mother's right to bodily
autonomy does not reduce the baby's right to life. The mother using her
body to care for and grow the baby does not limit the baby's right to
continued existence. The fact that the mother may not have wanted to end
up pregnant does not limit the baby's right to life.

But of course, this is the point that the pro-choice people trot out the
edge cases, like the 13-year old rape victim who is now pregnant. But
you can't use the edge to ignore the middle. While I certainly feel for
the 13-year old, I also feel for the baby, who didn't ask to be in this
situation either, but here we are.

But we're not ready for that discussion yet.

From a practical standpoint, "pro-life with a few exceptions" is the
appropriate platform to run on, and it is the stance that the majority
of state laws are implementing, in advance of the overturning of *Roe*.
Abortion on demand is mostly illegal (some states allow it early in the
pregnancy) but past a certain point, abortion becomes illegal unless
there is a reported rape, or when the physical life of the mother is at
risk.
