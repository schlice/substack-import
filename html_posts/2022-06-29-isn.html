The representation numbers, according to the Constitution, are
determined based on the population of (or the fact that you are in) a
state. DC is not a state, it is a special district.

So there is no Constitutional authority to give Congressional
representation to the district.

There are a few ways to address this:

- Legislation
- Constitutional amendment
- Return the District to the state of Maryland
- Make DC the 51st state

While these have all been proposed, they have all faced challenges, both
political and Constitutional.

But *taxation without representation?*

Those people live in a **not-state**. Only states have representation in
Congress.

Personally, I think the *best* argument is to return most of DC (all of
the *residential areas*) to Maryland, and reduce DC down to the areas
that only encompass government buildings. In this way, 95% of the
population of the district would end up in a state, and have voting
representation in Congress. Those who chose to continue living in the
areas immediately around the major government buildings would have to
accept the fact that they live in a **not-state** and keep living as
they are. Or they can move down the street and get their representation.

Original question:

Isn't disallowing the District of Columbia a voting member of the House
and representation in the Senate considered taxation without
representation?
