The ruling was that there is sufficient evidence to go to trial charging
the police with manslaughter.\
\
This makes sense, because the ***only*** time the police are responsible
for protecting one person is when they are in custody. The police failed
to do this, so they should rightly be charged. Whether or not they will
be ***convicted*** is a whole other story.\
\
PLEASE do not equate this with \"a problem with police violence against
people of color.\" If the police are convicted of murder, that would be
one thing. But these police officers are charged with manslaughter
because they allowed a suspect to die while in custody.\
\
**[There is no charge levied that the officers]{.underline}**
***[killed]{.underline}*** **[the suspect]{.underline}**. That would be
murder. The charge is that the officers allowed a suspect to die while
in custody, and if that was preventable by the officers, then they can
be charged with manslaughter. Voluntary or involuntary will be
determined by the DA.\
\
(EDIT) So the charges were released and two officers were charged with
murder. I think that this DA has an uphill battle to fight here. I
don\'t see this jury (wherever the trial is, because it certainly won\'t
be in Baltimore) returning guilty convictions for murder. That\'s way
too high a standard to meet and these charges are political, not
judicial; I\'m seeing possible manslaughter charges for one or two of
them, the rest will be acquitted. I\'m also seeing this Baltimore DA
losing her job over this.\
\
(EDIT2) It also appears that I never answered the second part of the
question:\
\
*What are some thoughtful solutions to the problem of police violence
against people of color?*\
\
I\'m not sure you have adequately identified such a problem. And the
answer to that question is not \"but I see it all the time on TV.\" In
such a case, the correct question would be \"*What are some thoughtful
solutions to the problem of television hyping up incidents between white
officers and black suspects?\"*\
\
When you identify that such a problem exists, please let us know how you
know there is a problem. Usually this involves statistics.\
\
Here\'s a few to get you started.\

- Police officers are *six times more likely* to be shot by young black
  men than the other way around.
- The leading cause of death for young black men is homicide, and in 90%
  of cases, the shooter is another young black man.
- The police aren\'t even involved in 96% of black homicides.
- The black population is about 14% of the country, but they commit more
  than half of the nation\'s violent crimes. They also make up 39% of
  the prison population.
- That\'s not a problem of \"over-policing:\" black men are arrested at
  nearly the exact rate that victims identify black men as their
  assailants. Police are in those areas because that\'s where the 911
  calls are coming from.
