**Content:** [If the suspect lashed out at the officers and struck them,
the suspect could be charged with assaulting a peace officer. If the
suspect was violently resisting and he struck an officer, he can
similarly be charged. If, however, he was simply combative, but never
struck an officer, he would likely be charged with resisting arrest and
failure to follow lawful orders.\
\
Rules differ by jurisdiction, so not all rules about actual charges are
universal. Therefore, the actual charge which is filed may be different.
But in general, the suspect needs to strike an officer before assault
will be charged.]{.rendered_qtext}
