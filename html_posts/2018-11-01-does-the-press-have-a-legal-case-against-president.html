**Does the press have a legal case against President Trump for inciting
violence against them?**

Not even close.

We have a 1st Amendment in the United States, and we're pretty proud of
it. We're also pretty protective of it.

The only way you can be cited for "inciting violence" is if you say
words which should reasonably be known to cause "imminent lawless
action."

There's a three-prong test to see if speech can be regulated as inciting
violence:

- Imminence. The speech must reasonably lead to "imminent" action, not
  some action at some unspecified future time.
- Intent. The speaker must intend on causing imminent lawless behavior.
- Likelihood. The speech must be likely to produce imminent lawless
  behavior.

Trump may say mean things about the press. But the government can only
restrict his speech if it reasonably incites imminent lawless behavior.
Simply strongly advocating a point is not imminent lawlessness. Simply
saying that "someone should take care of that issue" does not also
incite imminent lawless behavior.
