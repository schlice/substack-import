First of all, don't worry, there is no harm in leaving it up.

There's also no harm in you looking at it.

Where you can start to run into issues is if you *worship* *the image of
Jesus as he is depicted*. This is because any image of God or Jesus
necessarily *constrains* them to that image, and they are so much more
powerful and awesome than can ever be captured in an image.

Images might be useful to guide our prayer, but they are very easy to
abuse as they end up becoming the *focus* of the prayer instead of a
*conduit* for prayer.

Don't pray to the picture. Pray to the Christ.

And you and your home decorations will be just fine.

Original question:

I was given a beautiful painting on canvass of Jesus by my sister in law
whom my wife and i share a home with. Ofcourse in order to spare
feelings i hung it on my bedroom wall. I believe pictures of Jesus are
mere speculation and definitely not Jesus.I dont look at it much and of
course do not really care for it. Is there any harm of leaving it up i
dont want to hurt her feelings?
