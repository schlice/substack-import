**I am a born and worshiping Catholic but I find tarot cards, crystals,
auras, etc fascinating. I want to pursue this for fun, but is that
against God? The first commandment is that he is my only God, and he is.
I do not worship Satan, only my God.**

Personally, I believe that God cares more about what is in your heart
than what is in your hands.

If you learn about crystals and auras and tarot cards because you find
it fascinating, I see no issue with that.

**If you use those things because you truly believe in them more than
you believe in God,** then you are practicing witchcraft.

For a normal, God-fearing Catholic, you should be able to differentiate
between learning about something as a hobby or to expand your knowledge,
and practicing something as a religion. There is a line there, and it
might be easy to cross, but what you do and what you believe are between
you and God. No one can tell you otherwise.

Here's an idea: learn all you like. God gave you not only the ability to
learn, but he also gave you a natural curiosity. If God didn't want you
to be curious, he would not have imbued you with curiosity.

But in all your hobbies, *don't ever let them supplant God.* Be mindful
of this, and active in ensuring that you don't begin to ever put any of
this stuff above God. Your faith is in him, not little rocks or pieces
of cardboard. They can never bring you happiness or salvation. They have
no powers. Only God does.

But it's fun to see what people believe and why they believe it.

Sometimes, I learn about other religions. Is that blasphemy? Of course
not. I'm *learning*, not *practicing*. I don't believe the stuff I'm
learning about Zoroastrianism or Mormonism or any one of the hosts of
other religions I have learned about.

And that is just fine.
