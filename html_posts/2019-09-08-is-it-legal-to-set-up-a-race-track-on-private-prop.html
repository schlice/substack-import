**Is it legal to set up a race track on private property you own?**

Whether or not it is legal is usually controlled by the government body
controlling the area in which you own land.

Most areas where people own land are covered by what is known as
*zoning*. Zoning allows governments to allocate areas of land for
specific uses. Most ownable land is zoned for some purpose, be it
commercial, residential, multi-family, office buildings, etc.

If you own property in the middle of nowhere, where it takes you an hour
of driving through absolute nothingness to reach, not covered by any
zoning regulations, then you can probably do anything you like on your
property and not only would it be legal, but no one would likely notice.

However, if you are like most land owners and you own a piece of
property anywhere near a populated area, you will probably have to
comply with local zoning laws.

(EDIT) In the United States, all land falls within a state, so even if
you're in the middle of nowhere, you still have to comply with any state
laws regarding operating a race track, especially if people are able to
come see the cars.

If it's literally a private race track just for you, it's highly
unlikely that the state would even care.
