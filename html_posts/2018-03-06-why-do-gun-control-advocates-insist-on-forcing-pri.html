**Why do gun control advocates insist on forcing private sellers to go
through a licensed firearm dealer to conduct a background check? Why not
allow private sellers the ability to run background checks on potential
buyers themselves?**

The answer, as always, is money.

An instantaneous system like NICS which allows any citizen to run
background checks would not only be massive, but it would be expensive.
When NICS was implemented, this was the compromise made, because forcing
everyone to use NICS would mean that it would have been prohibitively
costly at the time it was implemented.

Therefore, the idea that background checks were only needed from gun
dealers, and private transactions did not need them was introduced, and
the NICS system was scaled to allow for only licensed dealers to use it.

The second problem is the "default allow" problem. If a NICS answer does
not return in three days, the sale defaults to allow. This is to prevent
another potential problem: the government inducing a *de facto* gun ban
simply by crashing the system. Using the default allow process, if the
government does not do its due diligence and prohibit a sale within
three days, the sale defaults to allow. If we simply open up NICS to
everyone, and it can't handle the volume of requests, some transactions
which should be prevented could default to allow simply because the
system can't handle the volume.

Finally, while I mostly trust FFLs to not abuse NICS, it's entirely
possible that people could use NICS for purposes other than selling
guns. Want to check up on your daughter's new boyfriend? Run a NICS
search! If he can't buy a gun, he's either a felon, a mental defective,
or something else that's serious enough to prevent a gun sale, so he's
also not good enough for dear old daughter. Abuse of the system would be
rife.

We need a new system. Opening NICS up to the world is a bad idea all
around.
