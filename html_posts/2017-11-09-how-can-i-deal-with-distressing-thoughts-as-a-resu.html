**Talk to a counselor.**

There's a stigma in the United States around talking to counselors.
Please do not fall victim to this stigma. Find a good counselor in your
area and talk to them. Your doctor can help you find a good counselor if
you don't know one.

Please, please do this. It will help tremendously.
