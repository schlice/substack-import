No, technically it would not be legal to do this.

First of all, how does someone "insist" you do something that you don't
want to do? Gunpoint?

Second, what this does is make you "quit" rather than be "fired." There
are several differences between quitting and being fired. The biggest
difference is unemployment. If you are terminated, and you are not
terminated for cause (meaning you aren't terminated because you violated
company policy, or did something else wrong), generally in most states
you are eligible for unemployment compensation. If they try to terminate
you for cause, the burden of proof would be on them to show what you
did, that they counseled you on the issue, and they gave you an
opportunity to answer for what you did. This means they'd have to
fabricate a lot of details (lots of paperwork, lots of forged
signatures) to terminate you for cause when there was no cause. If they
don't do this, they open themselves up to lawsuit for unlawful
termination, even in an "at will" state. Terminating you without cause
gives you unemployment benefits.

There are other benefits to being fired over quitting as well, and they
may be related to things like tenure and vacation balances and re-hire
credit and insurance coverage, but those differ based on state as well
as industry and job title.

I would tell them that if they wanted me gone so bad, they could fire
me, but I'm not quitting, and I'm not signing anything. I suspect
they'll try to make my life hell from that point on, but let 'em try. I
laugh at their silly attempts to make my life hell. Ha!
