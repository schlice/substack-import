You can always file lawsuits against anyone for what they have done to
you. The question, of course, is whether or not you can *prevail*.

And in the case of a church, what they did "wrong" to you will determine
whether or not you might prevail in your lawsuit.

If they *harmed* you in some tangible way, you can absolutely sue for
damages. You can sue to recover damages in exactly the same way as if
you were harmed by someone who is not a church.

But if a church promised you an *intangible religious benefit* and you
don't feel you received that benefit, you cannot sue for that, because
there is no real "harm" from not receiving an intangible benefit.

So ultlimately, what they did or didn't do will determine how successful
you may be in a lawsuit.
