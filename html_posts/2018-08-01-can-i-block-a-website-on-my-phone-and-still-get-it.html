Depends on how you block.

If you\'re using the same browser platform on both devices, and your
blocking plug-in is the same, there is a fair chance that you can block
on one platform and see the block on the other.

However, it\'s not always the case. In fact, usually browsers are
different between mobile and desktop, so it\'s less likely that you will
see the same blocks on mobile that you see on desktop.
