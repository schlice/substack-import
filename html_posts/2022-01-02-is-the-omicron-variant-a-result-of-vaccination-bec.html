Omicron is a result of natural viral processes.

As a virus mutates, it becomes more *virulent* (i.e. easier to infect
people), but less *deadly* (i.e. won't kill you). I may not be a
virologist or an infectious disease specialist, but I remember a few
things from Biology 101. Viruses mutate and become more virulent and
less deadly. Killing your host is bad for the virus too, and so it is as
undesirable a condition for the virus as it is for the host.

And to answer that other guy who answered, unvaccinated people are
catching Omicron. There are five people in my house: four vaccinated,
and one unvaccinated. One of the vaccinated is also on
hydroxychloroquine for an unrelated condition. The only person in the
house who did not catch Omicron is the person on hydroxychloroquine. The
virus hit all of us, vaccinated and unvaccinated. It is extremely fast
moving and very contagious. But our symptoms were all comparatively mild
and flu-like.

Is the Omicron variant a result of vaccination (because it is more
