First of all, don't panic. MS is not the end of the world. It's also not
fatal, so for the most part, lifespans of people with MS these days
nearly match lifespans of people without the disease. And yes, there is
no cure for MS. We have some ideas, but we still don't even know what
causes it. MS commonly strikes people between ages 20 and 50, and hits
women two to three times more frequently than men.

The easy way to think of MS is to look at an electrical cord on a lamp.
If you were to scrape the insulation off of the cord, the electricity
wouldn't flow as well through that part of the cord. The wall sent the
same voltage, but by the time the voltage got to the lamp, it would be
less.

That's MS. It's an autoimmune disease which means the immune system is
attacking its own body. The immune system attacks the insulation on
nerve fibers, which we call myelin. We develop plaques, or "scars" on
those areas of demyelination. This is where the name comes from:
multiple sclerosis means "many scars." Signals don't flow as well
through those areas of demyelination, and it is that signal attenuation
which causes the physical symptoms you live with. For example, your
brain may tell your hand to grab something with a certain amount of
force, and by the time the signal reached your hand, it had degraded and
is now a weaker signal, so you drop things. Or with your feet, you trip
over nothing because you didn't pick your foot up as high as you
intended to.

MS is like that little "niggle" you have to live with every day. It's
not incredibly disruptive to your day, but it's annoying enough that you
never forget you have it.

There are two basic types of MS:

**Relapsing/Remitting MS (RRMS):** The majority of people diagnosed have
this type of MS. The disease course includes periods of worsening of the
disease (relapses) followed by long stretches of no disease activity
(remission). In fact, the approved MS drugs shrink the periods of
relapse, make their effects less, and lengthen the periods of time of
remission.

**Progressive MS (PPMS/SPMS):** Few people are initially diagnosed with
this form of the disease. This form of the disease may include periods
of relapse and remission, but usually does not. It's usually just a
steady worsening of symptoms with no periods of remission. There are a
scant few drugs which can actually work on progressive forms of the
disease. If the disease is untreated, 75% of RRMS patients will
transition to Secondary Progressive MS (SPMS) within 10 years. With
treatment, we are pushing that transition off by decades at a time.

If you've already seen a neurologist, that's good. If not, find a good
neurologist in your area and make an appointment. You're going to want
to get on one of the approved MS therapy drugs as soon as possible, in
my opinion. I believe the "conservative" approach is to "conserve" as
much brain matter as is humanly possible, so starting one of the
approved MS therapy drugs will be crucial.

There are a lot of drugs out there, but basically they all do the same
thing: reduce the amount of new lesions on the brain, shorten the time
and severity of relapses, and lengthen the time of remissions. The drugs
have different modes of operation (what they do to control the disease),
efficacies (effectiveness, or how well they work), and they have
different administration methods (oral, injection, or infusion). They
also all have different side effects. If you can't stand needles at all,
then perhaps an oral drug might be the way to go, but it works
differently and carries with it a whole set of side effects to deal
with. If you can stand a needle inside a pen-like device called an
auto-injector, perhaps the injectable is the way to go. There are fewer
long-term disruptive side effects with injectables. Ultimately, you want
to find a drug that's going to work for you and get on it, sooner rather
than later. There is mounting evidence that early treatment is more
beneficial, so the earlier you can start, the better.

And you have to consider yourself too. You are now more than a husband,
you are a caregiver. It sounds a little frightening (and maybe not
exactly what you signed up for), but you are the core of her support
system. Along with friends and family, and your medical team, you will
all face the **M**on**S**ter together.

Let us know if you have more questions, and good luck!
