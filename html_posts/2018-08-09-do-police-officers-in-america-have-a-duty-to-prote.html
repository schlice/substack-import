**Do police officers in America have a duty to protect citizens?**

There's a lot of answers in here, but let's break it down to the legal
nuts and bolts.

As far as the courts are concerned, police have what is called a
*general duty to protect citizens at large*, but they do not have a
*specific duty to protect any one person.* In 1989 SCOTUS stated,
\"Nothing in the language of the Due Process Clause itself requires the
State to protect the life, liberty, and property of its citizens against
invasion by private actors.\"

There are a few important exceptions, such as whether or not a *special
relationship* exists between the police and a citizen (i.e. if the
police have you in custody), or whether there is a *state-created
danger* (i.e. police left a situation more dangerous than they found
it).

The courts have been inconsistent when finding if a state created danger
exists in any one case. For example. the Third Circuit found that a
state created danger existed when police, after stopping two
pedestrians, left the intoxicated wife to walk a third of a block to her
home alone in the dark on a cold night after her husband had already
left. Sending her home \"unescorted in a visibly intoxicated state in
cold weather,\" made her \"more vulnerable\" to harm, which, the Court
held, was foreseeable. However, the Eighth Circuit held that a duty to
protect did not exist where the designated driver was arrested on a
warrant and allowed to drive his car to the police station. His
passengers, who were drunk, remained unattended in the car outside the
police station for about 30 minutes, drove off, and were involved in a
fatal crash. The Court reasoned that a due process claim could not be
brought, as it was not reasonable to find that the arresting officer
\"knew or should have known that the two passengers were drunk and unfit
to drive.\"

And specific to the tenor of the question, courts, like in *Castle Rock
v. Gonzalez*, have routinely found that there is no due process claim
when the police fail to serve orders or fail to investigate missing
persons or other calls for service. Prior to *Castle Rock*, for example,
the Tenth Circuit found that there was no due process claim when the
police failed to enforce a restraining order on a father who killed his
children.

As you can see, while there should be a due process claim when a special
relationship exists or when there is a state-created danger, Federal
courts don't always apply this standard consistently.
