Yes, it is illegal. Nearly everywhere. I say "nearly" because there's
probably somewhere that has a "bedroom spousal exception" that I'm not
aware of.

**In general, you cannot place any surveillance cameras in any area in
which there is a clear expectation of privacy.** This includes
bathrooms, bedrooms, locker rooms, changing rooms, etc. **You can, with
some jurisdictional tweaks, place cameras in common areas** like living
rooms, hallways, entryways, etc.

Doesn't matter who you are recording. Doesn't matter why you are
recording. If you want your video footage to be used for a legal reason
(i.e. as evidence in a court proceeding), you cannot record areas where
there is an expectation of privacy.

However, if you were trying to catch your spouse in an affair and you
installed a "nanny cam" in your bedroom, feel free to use that video to
"encourage" your cheating spouse into confessing, mostly because you
have them on video, in all their glory. Note that the video would not be
able to be used in criminal or civil proceedings, but it certainly works
to get the spouse to confess.

Also, you can record someone **with** their full knowledge and consent.
So if you want to record your spouse fixing the drain in the bathroom
for a YouTube instructional video, that's a permitted recording.
