It is called **deism.**

Deism is a philosophical and theological belief system that relies on
reason and observation of nature to understand God. Deists believe that
God created the world and then left it to operate on its own, following
natural laws.

**Beliefs**

- Deists believe in a supreme being or higher power.
- They believe in an afterlife.
- They reject the Bible as the word of God and the source of religious
  doctrine.
- They reject supernatural elements of Christianity, such as miracles,
  prophecies, and divine portents.

**History**

- Deism originated in Europe in the 17th century.
- It was a dominant religious attitude among Europe's educated classes
  by the late 18th century. It was also influential in early America,
  including the Founders and the first three US presidents.
- In fact, the Declaration of Independence contains Deistic languages,
  as it is believed that the men who wrote it were Deists.

**Branches of Deism**

- Christian deism
- Pandeism (the belief that God *became* the universe and no longer
  exists as a separate being).
