**If you get a paper check bearing Trump\'s signature, would you
consider framing it?**

I would. Well, I'd take a copy of it and then cash the original.

But I have no idea why Donald Trump would be paying me. Are you talking
about the Economic Impact Payments related to the COVID-19 pandemic? His
**name** will be on the check, right under where it says "Economic
Impact Payment". But his **signature** certainly won't be on it. The
Treasury Department will sign the check.
