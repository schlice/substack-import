**Is tree removal covered under homeowners insurance?**

Generally not, unless the tree falls on your home or your property (like
onto a fence) and causes damage. Then, your homeowner's policy will pay
to fix the damage and remove the tree. If the tree hasn't fallen yet,
its removal is usually not covered by your homeowner's insurance policy.

If your tree falls on your neighbor's house, typically your neighbor's
homeowner's policy will pay to fix the house and remove the tree. You
generally wouldn't be liable unless the tree was dead or was a
pre-existing hazard that you were told about.
