The Constitution clearly spells out how it can be amended, and this is
not part of that process.

Article V talks about how you can amend the Constitution. It says, for
the most part, that "{a}n amendment may be proposed by a two-thirds vote
of both Houses of Congress, or, if two-thirds of the States request one,
by a convention called for that purpose. The amendment must then be
ratified by three-fourths of the State legislatures, or three-fourths of
conventions called in each State for
ratification."[\[1\]](#lubxd){#cite-lubxd .citation_link}

Original question:

Let\'s say that the National Archivist was to sign and add the Equal
Rights Amendment to the Constitution, would that render Justice Alito\'s
opinion to overturn Roe Vs. Wade as moot?
