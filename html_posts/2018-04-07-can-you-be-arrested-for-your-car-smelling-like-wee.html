**Can you be arrested for your car smelling like weed?**

In short, no.

The smell of weed forms what is known as "reasonable suspicion" to
search the car for weed. He does not need your permission to search your
car. The smell forms an exception to the 4th Amendment, called the
"plain smell" exemption, which is patterned after the "plain sight"
exemption.

He can search your car, and he does not have to be gentle. He can call
in a drug-sniffing dog to assist with the search.

But if he does not find any weed in the car, you cannot be arrested
because your car smells like weed. You actually have to be in possession
of weed in order to be arrested for possession of weed.
