Military members are given MREs: [[Meals, Ready to
Eat](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f54b22&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meal,_Ready-to-Eat){.external_link

The MRE is both the sustenance, and the bane, of field troops
everywhere. Packaged rations have existed for almost as long as the US
Army has existed. They have existed in various forms, and for most of
the nation's existence, have consisted of canned goods. Canned meats,
vegetables, breads, and coffee were replaced by preserved meats (either
dried or salted) during World War I. WWII saw the introduction of
different types of rations, namely the Mountain Ration and the Jungle
Ration, but around the end of WWII into the Korean War, we moved back to
canned rations commonly known as "C Rations."

The MRE began development in the early 60s. It has been in continual
development throughout its use. General contents may include:

> - Main course (entree)
> - Side dish
> - Dessert or snack (often commercial candy, fortified pastry, or

> - Crackers or bread
> - Spread of cheese, peanut butter, or jelly
> - Powdered beverage mix: fruit flavored drink, cocoa, instant coffee
>   or tea, sport drink, or dairy shake.
> - Utensils (usually just a plastic spoon)
> - Flameless ration heater (FRH)
> - Beverage mixing bag
> - Accessory pack containing Xylitol chewing gum, water-resistant

One of the most recent developments was the inclusion of the *flameless
ration heater,* a small pouch containing a reagent plate. Water is added
to the pouch, which produces an exothermic reaction when in contact with
the plate. The entree pouch is placed inside the FRH pouch, and the
boiling water heats the entree without needing to start a fire.

I can tell you that while eating the rations without heating them is
possible, they become much more...palatable...once they are heated.

Everyone has their favorite MREs, and everyone has their least favorite.
Trading of entrees often happens.

When soldiers are deployed and are near field kitchens, regulations
require their rations be supplemented with fresh meals or
[[A-rations](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d5a153&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-ration){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}. A-rations are commonly
referred to as "box nasties." Wikipedia says that A-rations have been
called "bag nasties," but I've never heard that, since they come in a
rectangular white box. A-rations contain fresh, frozen or refrigerated
items, so they cannot be used everywhere. I can remember a box nasty
that consisted of cold fried chicken. It wasn't good when it was hot, so
you can imagine what it tasted like when it was cold. But it also had a
pear and a sports drink and a granola bar (?), so it wasn't too terribly
bad. One time, I took a 9-hour flight in the cargo hold of a C-141. We
were issued a box nasty and earplugs. Heh, have a great flight...

B-rations use preserved or pre-packaged foods in areas where there isn't
adequate refrigeration or freezer facilities available.
