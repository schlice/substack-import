It's true that for the first 300 years or so, Christians didn't use the
cross as a symbol. They used fish and shepherd's crooks, doves, and even
boat anchors. But the cross didn't become a thing until at least 300 AD.

Why?

The Roman cross was a horrifying symbol, a symbol of oppression used by
an authoritative regime to control and cower the masses. It wasn't until
the Christianization of the Roman empire and the ending of the practice
of crucifixion that anyone started using the symbol.

But it's not a symbol of power, as some of the other commenters here are
saying. It's a symbol of suffering. It's a reminder of what Christ
suffered to pay for our sins. And to do that for us sinners? "But God
demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners,
Christ died for us." (Romans 5:8 NIV). Christ *suffered on that cross*
to pay for our sins.

Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Whoever wants to be my disciple must
deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me." (Matthew 16:24
NIV). What did he mean by "take up their cross"? Did he mean "carry a
cross" like he carried his own cross up to Golgotha? *Or was he
referring to preparing to be crucified for their faith, as he was?*

In fact, if you look at the scripture, he was referring to preparing to
be crucified. We need to be prepared to face our deaths to proclaim him.
And when Satan offered Jesus all the kingdoms of the world for just
following him, we need to recognize that we are being offered the same
bargain. But Jesus reminds us that Satan is a liar and his bargain is a
scam. "What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit
their soul?" (Mark 8:36 NIV)

But Jesus offers us life. "Whoever tries to keep their life will lose
it, and whoever loses their life will preserve it." (Luke 17:33 NIV)
"Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for
my sake will find it." (Matthew 10:39 NIV)

For those who "lose their lives," for those who follow "in the way of
the cross" and lose their lives for him will save them. ***This*** is
what it means to take up your cross and follow him.

This is what the cross signifies. It is a symbol of power through
suffering. It is a symbol which signifies that we must be willing to die
for his sake. We must be willing to die to sin and be reborn in him.
This is why the cross is powerful.

Suffering is powerful. God uses our suffering for his good, as it is
when he is most powerful. "\[I\]n order to keep me from becoming
conceited, I was given a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to
torment me. Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me.
But he said to me, "**My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is
made perfect in weakness**." Therefore I will boast all the more gladly
about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me. That is why,
for Christ's sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in
persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong." (2
Cor 12:7--10 NIV) The symbol of the cross reminds us that we are
perfected through suffering, just as Christ's suffering was the perfect
sacrifice to pay for our sins.

For the first 300 years of the Church, the Cross was NOT a Christian
symbol. Why is it being used now as a Christian symbol? Who introduced
it?
