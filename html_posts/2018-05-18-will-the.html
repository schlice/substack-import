**Will the "leaders" in Washington do anything differently now that
we've had another mass shooting at a school?**

We hope so.

We hope that they'll stop wasting time with more ineffective gun laws
that won't make any difference in keeping our children safe.

We must realize that **laws do not prevent bad people from doing bad
things**. Laws might *deter* some good people from making bad choices.
Laws might make it *slightly more difficult* for a bad person to do a
bad thing, but that bad person will always find a way to do a bad thing
if they want to. **Laws are designed to provide a framework under which
we can punish people** ***who choose to break them***. That means
*before laws work, someone must actually break them.*

In this case, we want to *prevent bad people from doing bad things, and
to do that, we need to think of laws differently.*

We hope that leaders will actually implement some real "common-sense"
laws to protect our nation's children while they are in schools.

Some examples:

- Getting rid of ridiculous gun-free zones which are nothing more than
  "free-fire zones" or "target-rich environments" if you're so inclined.
- Allowing teachers with CCW permits to carry while in school.
- Actually securing school buildings, and implementing proper security
  procedures. Yes, having armed security guards in school helped in
  today's shooting, but we can do better. As Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said
  today, if we can secure a courthouse or other government buildings,
  there is no reason we can't secure a school, and keep guns from
  getting inside in the first place.
