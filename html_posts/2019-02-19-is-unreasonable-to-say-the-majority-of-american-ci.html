**Is unreasonable to say the majority of American citizens are suffering
from "Stockholm Syndrome"? Considering there is ample evidence to
indicate the State does not actually care for them: foreign invasions,
taxation at gunpoint, laws on the books?**

Of course it's unreasonable.

First, American citizens are not prisoners. They are free to elect a new
government at the next election cycle, and they do so with great
regularity. They can elect representatives who can undo the policies
which they find uncaring, and so far, they have not done so.

Second, the state is under no legal obligation to "care for" its
citizens. It can work in their best interest, but not everyone is going
to be best served by what the state does. The state tries to maximize
the benefits to everyone, but the state is not designed to be a "benefit
dispenser." The state is designed to maximize the ability for everyone
to live as they choose. The state is designed to ***promote*** the
general welfare, not ***provide*** it.

And I agree, the 16th Amendment should be repealed and replaced with a
national sales tax on new items and services, with a rebate given to all
citizens refunding taxes up to the poverty line, thus retaining a
progressive system, and the poor still will pay no tax. Then you won't
have "taxation at gunpoint." If you don't want to pay tax, buy used
items instead of new ones. Congratulations, you didn't pay any tax.
Taxes on essentials are refunded to you (ahead of time, so it's
technically a "prebate" and not a "rebate). [[Check it
