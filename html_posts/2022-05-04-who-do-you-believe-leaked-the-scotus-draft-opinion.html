Clearly, an employee in one of the Justice's offices was the leaker.

I can't imagine that it would be one of the clerks, because clerking for
a SCOTUS Justice is a major feather in your cap; only the best of the
best can clerk for a SCOTUS Justice. This description of a SCOTUS
Justice clerk says it all:

> CLERKING at the Supreme Court of the United States is the holy grail,
> the most prestigious gig any law grad can get. Only 36 SCOTUS
> clerkships come up for grabs each year. Only the brightest and very,
> very best need apply. Over a thousand who consider themselves in this
> category (and have letters of introduction from distinguished law
> professors and others to back them up) do so every year. And you
> don\'t go to the Supreme Court straight from law school -- usually all
> successful candidates have previously clerked at federal appellate
> level, and wowed their judges there.

Whoever this employee was, it's just odd that they allowed their
personal biases to overcome their respect for the institution, which
SCOTUS takes very seriously. Chief Justice Roberts discussed the loyalty
and respect for the institution shown by his permanent party staff:

> We at the court are blessed to have a workforce---permanent employees
> and law clerks who are intensely loyal to the institution and
> dedicated to the rule of law. Court employees have an exemplary and
> important tradition of respecting the confidentiality of the judicial
> process and upholding the trust of the
> Court.[\[2\]](#OFMgI){#cite-OFMgI .citation_link}

The Chief Justice announced that he has tasked the Marshal of the
Supreme Court to investigate the leak and find the leaker. It is unclear
what will happen to the leaker when they are found. Will they just be
fired? Will there be criminal charges? If they are an attorney, will
they be disbarred? Unknown at this time.

Who do you believe leaked the SCOTUS draft opinion on repealing Roe v.
