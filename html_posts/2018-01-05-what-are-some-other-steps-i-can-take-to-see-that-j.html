**What are some other steps I can take to see that justice is done after
being sexually harassed and assaulted by a deputy while working as a
contractor in the local county jail?**

While I'm sure a bunch of people on the Internet would love to help you,
your best bet is to **hire a lawyer**.

If you haven't done that yet, do.

If you have, *ask your lawyer* what more you can do.

If you were assaulted, you should go to the police. If you were
harassed, you should be filing a lawsuit with your lawyer. But either
way, talk to your lawyer about what to do and when to do it.

Most decidedly, don't take action on your case based on anything that
anyone says on the Internet, as it could hurt your chances for actual
recovery when you do enter a courtroom.

Please, hire a lawyer, and talk to him/her.
