The law comes from the court case *Terry v. Ohio*, in which a police
officer patted down the exterior of a suspect's coat for weapons.

During an aptly-named *Terry* stop, a police officer is allowed to
search the exterior of a person for his safety. This means he can "pat
down" the person on their exterior garment to check for weapons. He
can't reach into pockets and search them for anything at all. He can
only pat down the outermost garment.

You do not have to consent to this search. It makes no difference. As
long as the officer has reasonable suspicion to initiate a *Terry* stop,
the pat-down incident to the stop is legal and does not require consent.
You can even shout, "I DO NOT CONSENT!" at the top of your lungs while
they search you, and it won't make a hill of beans worth of difference.
They will still conduct the pat-down.

They ask the ridiculous to make you feel better. And probably because
it's just funny, and they are humans (despite our insistence that they
be perfect robots all the time).
