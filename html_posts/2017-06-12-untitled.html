I can personally attest to the .30--06 example.

Fire one in an indoor range, for example, and EVERYONE knows it. While
the other guns on the range go "pop, pop, POP POP, pop pop" the .30--06
goes "BOOOOOOOOOM." It's a very intimidating (and loud) sound in a room
full of loud sounds.

Even outdoors, it's louder than anything else you routinely shoot, from
.45 to 12-gauge to 5.56 NATO. That .30--06 announces its presence. You'd
better hope you hit that deer/elk/whatever you're shooting at with the
first round, because the whole area knows you fired a shot.
