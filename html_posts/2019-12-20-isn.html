**No**, because it isn't a *judicial* *trial*. It's a political
proceeding that looks like a trial. In either the House or the Senate,
you don't really have the right to a speedy trial, because it's not
really, at its core, a trial.

**Most definitely yes**. McConnell & Co should issue subpoenas for the
Articles of Impeachment and should hold her in contempt of Congress if
she refuses to produce them, along with beginning criminal proceedings
against her in order to force her to comply with the subpoenas.

Doesn't that strike you as odd? Pelosi says that Trump was obstructing
Congress by failing to turn over state secrets he protected under
executive privilege, but now she finds it perfectly acceptable to ***do
exactly the same thing*** with the Senate? How come Trump's is
obstruction of Congress, but hers is not?
