You're not the only one who had questions after reading that article.
Graduates, too, had many questions about the changes in the training
curriculum.

I think Mr. Wood means well, but I think that buzzing in for a few
hours, poking around a little bit, and somehow collecting enough valid
information to formulate a global opinion about what's "wrong" with
USAFA is not only short-sighted, but begins a dangerous precedent.

Ultimately, grads, administration, and staff all want the same thing: to
produce officers of character who are productive on day one of their
careers. This is [[General Michelle
Johnson's](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=92f789&url=http://www.af.mil/About-Us/Biographies/Display/Article/107919/lieutenant-general-michelle-d-johnson/){.external_link

qt-tooltip="af.mil"}]{.qlink_container} ('81) goal as well, so right
away, we're all on the same page. That's a good start, right?

So let's get down to some specifics.

- Before we point out the speck in our brother's eye, did we stop to
  remove the plank from our own? Did we ever stop to ask ourselves not
  what is wrong with current USAFA training, but what might have been
  wrong with **our** USAFA training? The USAFA training experience of
  the 1980s and 1990s was more about mental toughness than effective
  leadership, and it infected graduates with a host of well-known
  pathologies, including arrogance, hyper-competitiveness, fear of and
  intolerance for error, and most pervasive of all, a deep and abiding
  cynicism. Graduates' favorite incongruity is repeating Schofield's
  quote about "harsh or tyrannical treatment" or Rommel's quote about
  "avoiding excessive sharpness or harshness of voice" while being
  yelled at. Rarely did one stop to wonder if there might be other,
  better ways to push cadets to their limits than keeping them
  half-starved, sleep-deprived, and fearful for an entire year. Good
  institutions conduct such reviews periodically. It would be surprising
  to find an institution that did not.
- Innovation is what the Air Force is about. Tradition cannot get in the
  way of the mission. As one alumni noted, the perception of discipline
  among the freshmen, or at least the crisp outward trappings of
  discipline, has declined. Perhaps this is a worthwhile trade-off for
  nurturing internal discipline and practicing methods of leadership
  other than instilling fear. Ultimately, rather than trying to find
  fault in the training curriculum, since our goal is to produce
  officers of character who are productive on day one, shouldn't we be
  measuring *officer* quality rather than *cadet* quality? Military
  institutions are revered based on the quality of their **graduates**,
  not the quality of their **students**. We all know Lance Sijan '65
  (GBNF) was not a model cadet while he was in attendance, but his
  bravery is the stuff of legend, as well as the first and only
  Congressional Medal of Honor for an Academy grad. If you were to judge
  USAFA by Cadet Sijan's example, what would you find? Now judge USAFA
  by **Captain** Sijan's example. Would you reach the same conclusion?
  Eisenhower is not significant because he attended West Point; West
  Point is significant because Eisenhower, the great military leader,
  had it as his alma mater. Hopefully you can see the difference.

Does this shift in focus make an Academy graduate any less disciplined?
Externally, perhaps. Perhaps the outward trappings of discipline are a
little less sharp. But internal discipline? As good as ever. Does this
shift make USAFA a less disciplined or rigorous institution? **Not at
all.** I can happily report that cadets are challenged to levels that
would have made us cringe, and they are learning things that are more
technical than we could have ever dreamed of. And I have worked in the
technology fields for the better part of a quarter of a century, and
their technical acumen is so good, it's scary.

The world is changing, and so is the face of warfare. Being able to
adapt to the new paradigms should be a *hallmark* of a great
institution, not a *black mark* against it. It is institutions like the
one we quipped consisted of "over two hundred years of tradition
unhampered by progress" which should make us fearful for the officers it
produces. I'm not saying specifically that this is the case, because I
don't know how the other service academies have adapted to the new face
of warfare. I only know how USAFA has adapted. And if we use officer
quality as our measure (as we should), then we are doing just fine.
