*Note that in Colorado, most HOAs have separated the Policies &
Procedures from the Rules & Regulations. In most other HOAs, they are
all one document, generally called the Policies, Procedures, Rules &
Regulations, or abbreviated PPR&R. In this answer, any reference to the
Rules broadly refers to an HOA's Governing Documents, which can include
the Covenants and the PPR&R.*

In general, HOAs have broad latitude to control the areas within their
jurisdictions. Courts have generally supported most HOA rules which are
uniformly enforced. Despite what others may have said, an HOA can indeed
restrict on-street parking, even when they do not own the street (i.e.
it is a city-owned street).

Essentially, when you sign the covenants, you are entering into a
contract between yourself (the Homeowner) and the HOA. The contract (the
Covenants) lays out ground rules for living in that community. The
Covenants also state that the HOA Board can create Rules and
Regulations, and they carry the same force and weight as the Covenants.
Again, this is in general, and can vary by state, and even by HOA.

With that understanding, then **yes**, the HOA Board can indeed add
parking restrictions to those Rules.

What will be different between an HOA which contains **city streets**
and an HOA which is part of a **gated community** is what the HOA can do
with parked cars in violation of the Rules. The difference turns on who
owns the roads.

- In a gated community, the HOA has complete and total control over the
  roads. They can boot or tow improperly parked cars at their
  discretion, in accordance with the Rules and Regulations. They own the
  roads, they make the rules.
- In HOAs where the HOA does not own the streets, their only remedy for
  homeowners violating the Rules is whatever remedies are listed in the
  Covenants; usually this is limited to fines. The fines are levied
  based on the Schedule of Fines listed in the Governing Documents. They
  cannot boot or tow cars not following the Rules.

If you believe that your HOA board is acting unlawfully, your only
remedy as a homeowner is to hire an attorney after you are fined under
the rule and challenge the legality of that rule.
