So you looked at the 2015 figures and you saw that there were 33,000
deaths by handguns and then you saw that cops in the same year killed
250 black people and you thought that was "so many?"

Or do you think there are "so many" because of **media bias**: it's all
you see on TV?

In fact, police killed ***twice*** as many white people in 2015 than
they did blacks.

So to answer your question: **there are not so many.**
