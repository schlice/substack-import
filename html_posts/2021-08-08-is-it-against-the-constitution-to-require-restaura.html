The Constitution doesn\'t make law. The Constitution binds the
government, and keeps them in their lane.

That said, the Bill of Rights lists some common rights that the
government might abridge. So you may be asking if it violates any of
your rights for a restaurant to only serve you if you have a vaccine
card.

The answer in the US is no, it does not violate your rights.

Restaurants, although it is commonly misconstrued, are not public
establishments. They are private establishments which are open to the
public. There is a distinct difference.

A private establishment open to the public can set whatever rules it
wants to for those who would come in. There are some obvious things that
a restaurant cannot discriminate by, and those would be things that are
specified in the Equal Rights Act. These are things like race, color,
gender, religion, or country of origin.

But if a restaurant wanted to discriminate based on vaccine card, as
long as they applied that restriction equally to every patron, they are
certainly allowed to do that.

Similarly, states and cities (like New York City) can set their own
rules for how restaurants in their state or city operate, so setting the
rule that restaurants must only admit patrons who are vaccinated is also
legal and not unconstitutional.

(EDIT) In the same way, states can set rules for their businesses which
require them to *not* deny patrons based on vaccination status. In fact,
Florida has done just this: no business in the state of Florida can deny
entry to a patron based on vaccination status. In fact, the state has
begun the process of fining businesses \$5000 each for doing this:

Note that this doesn't apply to healthcare facilities, and it also
doesn't apply to businesses which may impose vaccine mandates on their
employees.
