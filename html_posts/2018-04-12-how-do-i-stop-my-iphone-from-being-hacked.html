**How do I stop my iPhone 6s from being hacked?**

Your question seems to imply that a hack is "in progress" and you need
to "stop" it. If that were the case, power it off. An iPhone that is off
cannot be hacked.

Now, you probably wanted to ask, "How do I *prevent* my iPhone 6S from
being hacked?"

Here's the best things you can do:

- Keep the latest Apple firmware on it.
- Don't jailbreak it. Jailbroken software bypasses critical security
  controls, and if you don't know what you're doing (based on the fact
  that you had to ask the question in the first place, I'm going to
  presume you don't), you could open up security holes.
- Don't visit websites without some form of protection. Use approved
  browsers only (on an iPhone, you should only use Safari)
- Install antivirus. I know it seems silly (viruses on a phone?), but
  they do exist. Take a look at Lookout Mobile Security and Avast Mobile
  Security.
- Don't give your phone to people you don't trust. Require passwords to
  be entered in the App Store in order to install apps so only you can
  install them.

Hope this helps
