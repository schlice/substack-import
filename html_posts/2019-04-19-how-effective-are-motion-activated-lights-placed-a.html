**How effective are motion activated lights placed around my home in an
effort to deter burglars?**

As a part of your "defense in depth" strategy, using motion-activated
lights are very effective, especially to light up corners and secluded
areas around your house which are easy for burglars to hide in and take
their time entering your home.

Pairing that with other, secondary security measures and defenses inside
your home will not only make your home less attractive to burglars but
will safeguard you inside your home as well.
