**What would happen if Trump tried to force the states to re-open, and
what will happen if we defy him?**

I don't know how he could force states to re-open. He has no such
authority.

But let's assume, for argument's sake, that he somehow attempted to
force states to re-open.

How states respond is fully up to states.

Let's say California's governor believes it's "too soon" to re-open. He
can simply choose to not lift his "stay at home" order. Since there is
no Federal "stay at home" order (nor is any available for them to
implement), then Californians will be forced to stay at home.

But let's say Florida's governor believes the president, and lifts any
statewide "stay at home" order, but **you** believe it's still too soon.
What's a scared citizen to do?

**Stay home**.

No one is forcing you to leave your home. They can re-start the economy
without you. I mean, like most people who were forced to stay home and
who worked in a job where you couldn't work from home, you probably lost
your job anyway. So just stay home.

Unless, of course, you have to go back to work.

Well, now you're in a pickle, aren't you. You want to go back to work,
but you're scared of the virus. What should you do? You should go back
to work, and you should ensure your employer is providing you with all
of the personal protective equipment (PPE) required in your particular
job situation: masks, gloves, gowns, etc. Whatever is required. Then
make sure you wear it, don't get lazy. If they don't, contact OSHA and
report them for an unsafe working environment.

Also, make sure you, personally, continue to practice good social
distancing, even when you're not at work.
