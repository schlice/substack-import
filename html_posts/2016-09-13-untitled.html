He may know more about ISIS than generals, but he never claimed to know
how to run a military. He would most definitely leave that to the
generals.

He's not a politician. He doesn't speak like a politician. He's not
polished. He's arrogant. All of this is true. Sometimes his brain-mouth
filter doesn't kick in and he says things he shouldn't. It is true, he
is flawed. But he is a good man, with flaws.

Hillary is a crooked liar and a cheat. She is dangerous. She is not
stupid. When she said "I don't know" or "I don't remember" those were
lies. She does know. She does remember.

I do believe he would consult with military leaders on ISIS, as he said
he would.
