**On a business trip to the USA, I was asked for ID when entering a bar.
The guys on the door were very surprised that I didn\'t routinely Carry
ID on me (I\'m from the UK). Is this a normal \'thing\' in the USA?**

You must understand the cultural differences.

The entire layout of the country was built around the automobile. How we
lay out communities and towns and cities and neighborhoods is all
predicated on the presence of a personal automobile. While in the UK you
can walk to a neighborhood store or to school or to the library, in the
US, in nearly all cities, you have to drive there because the distances
are usually too great. Some small strip malls are appearing in more
populated suburbs to make up the difference, but even these may be too
far to walk to. They may be just a few minutes drive, however.

To that end, nearly everyone is a driver, so it is very common for
almost everyone to routinely carry their license with them. It is used
just as much as a form of personal identification as it is a validation
that they are able to drive a car on public roads.

Additionally, bars in the United States ID everyone who appears to be
under 40 years old, and the most commonly accepted form of
identification is a driver's license.
