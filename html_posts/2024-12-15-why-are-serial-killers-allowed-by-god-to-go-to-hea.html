Anyone who *truly* repents of their sins and trusts in Jesus as their
Lord and Savior, who truly believes that He died to pay for their sins,
will be saved.

No one's sin is too great that it can't be forgiven. Are you saying that
God is incapable of forgiving some sin? Or that He's not as loving as
people make Him out to be? Or that His mercy has limits? Or that some
people are beyond saving?
