**Is there a difference between a citizen\'s arrest and detaining
someone for the police?**

Yes, there is a big difference. One is a citizens arrest, and the other
is unlawful detention.

**Can you detain a most wanted fugitive and hold them for the police?**

**No.** Citizens arrest is a very specific function which varies by
state. Almost universally though, you can only effect it when someone
perpetrates a crime in your presence.

Detaining anyone without special provision to do so in the law is a
crime.
