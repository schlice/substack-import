**Can a president be impeached for acts that are not criminal?**

Yes. Remember that impeachment is a *political* remedy, while indictment
for crimes is a *judicial* remedy.

When President Gerald Ford was in Congress, he uttered these famous
words: "\[A\]n impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House
of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history."

That said, most Congresses have defined impeachable offenses as anything
which could be prosecuted as a crime. That's not to say that this is a
rule, but it is precedent.

However, to answer the question, the House can impeach a president for
any reason they deem is impeachable.
