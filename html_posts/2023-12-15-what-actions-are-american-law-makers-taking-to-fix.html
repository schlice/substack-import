***Absolutely nothing.***

- All fifty states have laws which allow breastfeeding in any public or
  private location.
- Thirty-one states specifically exclude breastfeeding from public
  indecency laws.
- Thirty states have laws related to breastfeeding in the workplace.
- Twenty-two states exempt breastfeeding mothers from jury duty or allow
  their duty to be postponed.
- Four states have endorsed or encouraged the development of a
  breastfeeding awareness or education campaign.

It seems that American lawmakers are *doubling down* on breastfeeding,
rather than considering it public indecency.

It would only be a miscarriage of justice if the justice system came to
an *unjust* conclusion. So is it *unjust* that we consider breastfeeding
to not be public indecency? The answer comes down to how society feels
about breastfeeding, and how society feels that laws should convenience
those who take offense at seeing such things. Countries do this
differently. In Australia, laws encourage mothers to be considerate of
those around them who might see them feeding their babies, while in the
US, those encouragements don't exist. The law encourages mothers to
breastfeed and not feel uncomfortable about doing so.
