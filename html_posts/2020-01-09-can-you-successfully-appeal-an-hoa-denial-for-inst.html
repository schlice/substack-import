**Can you successfully appeal an HOA denial for installing a fence?**

Who exactly are you going to appeal to? There is no group which controls
HOAs, as they are nothing more than 501(c)(4) non-profit corporations
which you voluntarily joined by purchasing a home in a community which
is under covenant control.

To answer the specific question, if the HOA has denied your request to
install a fence, your only other option is to file a lawsuit against the
HOA and claim that they are either not enforcing the covenants fairly,
or that they have broken their own agreements in some way. You might
consider contacting a licensed real estate attorney in your area who
specializes in HOAs.

However, if there's something in the rules that says you cannot install
the fence you want to install, in the way you want to install it, and
they enforce that rule with everyone within that HOA, there is a fair
chance that you won't be able to get them to reverse that decision. HOAs
have broad latitude to write and enforce pretty much whatever rules they
choose, so long as they don't violate any higher laws or city codes.

You can claim you have some sort of exemption. We had a woman in our
neighborhood who installed unauthorized screening on the inside of her
split-rail fence, and she claimed that the dogs she had for her
disability required the screening. The HOA at the time didn't want to go
up against a possible disability lawsuit, so they dropped the matter.
She got to keep the screening. Perhaps you and your attorney can find
some sort of exemption you can claim in order to install your fence.

Beyond hiring an attorney, there's not much more you can do.
