**Is placing the knee on the back of the neck of the person you are
arresting part of police training?**

So as you've probably read by now, training varies, and department
policy when it comes to use of force also varies between departments so
that you can appropriately meet the needs of your locality.

There was a control technique (never one I was taught, nor anyone I know
of) which involved an officer kneeling on a suspect with BOTH KNEES, one
knee at the torso and the other knee at the base of the neck. The key to
performing that technique correctly was the distribution of the weight.
Nearly the full weight of the officer was on the knee in the torso. As
was explained during the training video I saw, there was very little
force required at the neck to keep the head and shoulders down. It was
essentially nothing more than the weight of the leg itself holding the
head and shoulders in place. The video I watched *emphasized* the point
that all the weight was on the back, hardly any of the weight was on the
neck. Also, the suspect in the training was **ON HIS SIDE**, not flat on
his stomach.

Most departments opted to not use that technique because it was
difficult to master, and it placed suspects at risk of injury if it was
done incorrectly. It also carried a risk of [[positional
asphyxia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=09015b&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_asphyxia){.external_link

As in this case. This was a perfect example of why departments routinely
bypassed this technique.

This is not uncommon. Police departments change techniques all the time
based on new findings and new science. When my dad was a cop, *hog
tying* used to be a technique for suspects who were out of control,
kicking out police car windows while in handcuffs. They stopped using
hog tying because of suspects dying in the back of police cars due to
positional asphyxia. The technique now would be to take that same wild
child out of the car, spray with pepper spray, and put back in the car.
Repeat as needed until suspect stopped wilding.

*Sorry, no comments on this one.*

*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is
grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,
downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora
is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply
going to comment to tell me how much the police suck or \"ackshually,
you\'re wrong,\" then you're the reason why I disable comments. Well
done, Karen. You ruined it for everyone.*
