**Is local or state law enforcement allowed to listen to your
conversations and read your text messages on your phone without you
knowing it?**

Yes.

In order to do this, they must have a *warrant*. And in order to get a
warrant, they must have enough probable cause to convince a judge that
they need to listen to your conversations and read your text messages in
order to get the evidence they need to send you to jail.

Not even the cell phone companies will allow them to listen to your
phone calls or read your text messages unless they produce that warrant.
If they are conducting targeted investigations, sometimes they will use
a StingRay interception device, but those are more rare. Routinely, they
will go to the phone company with their warrant.
