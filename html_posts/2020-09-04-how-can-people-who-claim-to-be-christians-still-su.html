**How can people who claim to be Christians still support Donald Trump
despite his very Un Christian like behavior? If your children exhibited
the behavior that he does wouldn't you correct them?**

I presume you want me to say something like "As a Christian, I am
appalled at Trump's bombastic behavior. It's so un-Christianlike! I
simply cannot support such a boorish man."

Sorry, not in this answer.

I am not responsible for Trump's behavior. There are plenty of things I
wish he would do differently, but Trump is Trump, and Trump's gonna
Trump.

I am only responsible for my childrens' behaviors. I tell them that the
President has a tough job and sometimes he gets angry, just like I do.
Sometimes, he doesn't choose his words carefully, just like I do. The
bottom line is that *he is the President, not the Pope.*

He is the **political** leader of the country, not the **moral** leader
of the country. Nor should he be. People should be free to build up
their childrens' morals and ethics as they see fit. Many people may
choose to use Christian morality (found in the Bible) to do this; others
will not. All of that is perfectly okay.

I do not think myself so noble that I must withhold support of the
President because he doesn't act the way I'd like him to. He is human,
plain and simple. If I was looking for a spiritual leader to give me my
ethical roadmap (even if I didn't have one already), I wouldn't be
looking to the White House.

The reason why a Christian can still support the President when he acts
in a decidedly un-Christianlike manner is that **Christians do not love
based on others' actions**. We are all sinners and have all fallen short
of the grace of God. I am no better than Trump in that regard.

But God loves us all the same. He sent his son to take on human form and
*die*. For us. So that we could be made right with him. He did that for
**all of us**. Trump included.

So I know that even in Trump's imperfection, God still loves every one
of us.

> *But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still
> sinners, Christ died for us.*

> ---Romans 5:8 NIV

Use Trump as a teaching opportunity. Teach your children not to judge
others, despite what they say or do. Judgement is up to God. Our job is
to love God and love our neighbors as we love ourselves. Let God take
care of God's job.
