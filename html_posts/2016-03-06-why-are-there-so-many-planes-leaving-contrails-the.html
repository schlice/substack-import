It\'s a conspiracy, man! The government is spraying toxic chemicals out
of airliners!

Seriously now, whether or not you see contrails all has to do with the
weather over LA. If the weather conditions are such that contrails will
form, then you\'ll see them.

The weather patterns over LA have been such that over the past few
weeks, contrails have been more visible.
