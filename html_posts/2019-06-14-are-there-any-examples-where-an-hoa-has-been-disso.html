**Are there any examples where an HOA has been dissolved by members or
the state for operating in violation of by-laws/covenants or state
statutes?**

I would venture to say no.

The operation of the HOA is separate from the charter of the HOA. The
only reason I could see an HOA dissolved without the consent of all of
the members is if the HOA was fraudulently formed.

If an HOA is doing something not in accordance with its own bylaws, the
remedy is a lawsuit. The directors would probably be removed, and could
face charges of their own, especially if they were knowingly violating
the bylaws.

The only way to dissolve an HOA is with the consent of the members. It
varies by state what percentage of the signing members must consent, but
it's somewhere between 75 and 100%, depending on state. There are other
factors to consider: contracts which need to be re-written or dissolved,
community property which must be disposed of, watering bills which need
to be paid by someone, insurance policies on common areas which must be
owned by someone, etc. A real estate attorney must do this work.
