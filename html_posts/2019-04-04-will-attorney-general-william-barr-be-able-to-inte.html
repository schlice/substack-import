**Will Attorney General William Barr be able to intervene in any way to
help President Trump keep his tax returns under wraps?**

Probably not.

The tax returns are being requested under IRS code 6103(f). This is
consistent with Congress' oversight power over the IRS.

But that said, we need to be sure we understand why Congress can do
this, and what they're looking for.

**Congress is allowed to do this to keep the IRS on track, not to hurt
the President.**

They asked for tax returns from 2013 to 2018. For each year, they also
asked for statements regarding:

1.  whether such return is or was ever under any type of examination or
    audit
2.  the length of such examination or audit
3.  the applicable statute of limitations on such examination or audit
4.  the issue(s) under examination or audit
5.  the reason(s) the return was selected for examination or audit, and
6.  the present status of such examination or audit (to include the date
    and description of the most recent return or return information
    activity).

Additionally, Congress is **not** authorized to disclose those tax
returns to anyone else.

I want to quote a section from the FAQ that was included with the letter
to the IRS from Chairman Neal on the House Ways and Means Committee:

> **Why is the Chairman making this request?**

So from a full reading of the letter, they are doing this pursuant to
their oversight role only, and being able to craft law pursuant to what
the IRS actually does.

To that end, *any use of this material, outside of oversight and
legislation,* ***should be dealt with extremely harshly.*** If Congress
abuses this authority, and either a. the President's tax returns
magically leak on to the Internet, or b. some other type of action
begins against the President based on information in these tax returns,
Congress should be held to account for violating Federal IRS law.

Breaking tax laws is something that the President's advisers have found
out is a bad thing. Congress must be held to the same standard.
