**Former CIA Director Michael Hayden lied about torture to keep people
in Guantanamo and claimed Muslim immigration would destabilise Europe.
How does he have any moral authority to compare Trump\'s family
separations at the border with Auschwitz?**

Let's break this down.

The first sentence is irrelevant. It has nothing to do with the question
you asked.

So let's focus on the question instead:

**How does he have any moral authority to compare Trump\'s family
separations at the border with Auschwitz?**

No one has any moral authority to compare treatment of illegal
immigrants to anything, nor is moral authority required to make a
comparison.

As to the comparison, it's always a losing argument when you compare
anything to Hitler, Nazism, or the Holocaust. Once you feel like you
have to invoke Hitler, you've already lost the argument.

But in any case, on any *objective, fact-based analysis*, **enforcing US
immigration law is light years away from the Holocaust.**

Read a book, for crying out loud. These incessant cries of "Trump is
Hitler," "The Southern Border is Auschwitz" are really just plain
stupid. People entering this country illegally have broken US
immigration law and are treated as criminals (as opposed to previous
administrations who simply let them go in a practice called "catch and
release", which this president's policy stopped). The Jews did nothing
illegal. I mean, the sheer audacity of someone comparing enforcing
legally-passed and court-reviewed immigration law at a nation's border
to the systematic killing of Jews simply because they are Jewish is
literally just staggering.

It's a lazy argument at best; it's insulting and morally reprehensible
at worst.
