No, it's just not a good idea. Alcatraz was shut down because it became
too expensive to maintain. In today's dollars, it's just not
realistically feasible to re-open it.

Alcatraz is a relic. It's got the emotional appeal of this historical
badass prison, but practically, there are much better prison designs.

I bet if Trump visited ACX Florence (i.e. Supermax), he'd be singing a
different tune. He'd probably want to fund the construction of like five
more Supermax prisons, as the Supermax design is *functionally*
impervious to escape.

No island needed.
