The question is about becoming a pilot. I will address private pilots
and orthokeratology (Ortho-K), since it is a non-starter for military
service. Any condition corrected by Ortho-K is [[disqualifying for
military
service](https://www.quora.com/Is-eyesight-required-for-the-US-Army)]{.qlink_container}.

As far as the FAA is concerned, they have the following to say about
Ortho-K:

> Orthokeratology (Ortho-K) is the use of rigid gas-permeable contact
> lenses, normally worn only during sleep, to improve vision through
> reshaping of the cornea. It is used as an alternative to eyeglasses,
> refractive surgery, or for those who prefer not to wear contact lenses
> while awake. The correction is not permanent and visual acuity can
> regress while not wearing the Ortho-K lenses. There is no reasonable
> or reliable way to determine standards for the entire period the
> lenses are removed.
>
> Therefore, to be found qualified, applicants who use Ortho-K lenses
> **must meet the applicable vision standard while wearing the Ortho-K
> lenses AND must wear the Ortho-K lenses while piloting aircraft**. The
> limitation **must use Ortho-K lenses while performing pilot duties**
> must be placed on the medical certificate. [\[1\]](#PeGvq){#cite-PeGvq

**TL;DR: You can become a pilot using Ortho-K lenses. The caveat: While
Ortho-K lenses are supposed to be worn at night, you will have to be
able to meet the vision standards while wearing Ortho-K lenses, AND you
will have to wear your lenses while you fly.**
