Let\'s dissect your question.

***How can a person feel safe when he knows that most of the people in a
public place are carrying guns?***\
First of all, \"most\" is a pretty broad characterization. For you,
I\'ll take \"most\" to mean \"more than half,\" and that is incorrect.
The number of people concealing a firearm is much smaller than you
imagine. Probably less than 10% of the people you pass on the street are
carrying a firearm.

Additionally, are they carrying guns *legally* or *illegally*? Anyone
carrying a gun legally has a permit. To get that permit, presumably the
local law enforcement agency which issued the permit has ensured that
the individual has gone through (at a minimum) a background check, and
basic firearms training. So those are not people to be feared. And if
someone is carrying a gun *illegally*, there\'s no ban that will prevent
them from carrying a gun. If you ban all guns, they will just buy guns
illegally, and when caught, will hopefully face stiff penalties for
doing so.

***\[M\]oreover anyone can flip out any minute! You never know what goes
in a persons mind***\
I suppose that\'s true. And I also suppose that someone can \"flip out\"
while he/she is carrying a gun. However, let\'s stick with reality. You
don\'t see too many people walking down the street suddenly lose their
grip on reality. I\'ve actually not ever heard of someone being
perfectly sane at one moment, and then suddenly and inexplicably finding
themselves in wacko-land. There is generally some indication beforehand
that someone is going to lose their grip on reality.

***\[W\]hat if some accident happens?***\
From \"accident\" I presume you\'re referring to the \"accident\" where
someone legally carrying a concealed weapon walking down the street is
inexplicably beset by a weapons discharge whereby the weapon in the
holster on their belt starts firing madly and killing people all around
it.

This \"accident\" ***never*** happens.

Weapons do not \"mysteriously\" discharge in this way. In fact, most
semi-auto handguns in circulation have several internal safeties which
prevent the weapon from discharging unless the trigger is being pulled.
One of my instructors claimed you could hammer a nail with the back of
our Beretta 92F handguns and they would not discharge, as there were no
fewer than four internal safeties within the weapon that prevent the
firing pin from engaging the primer on the bullet unless the trigger is
being pulled. If no one is pulling the trigger, the gun will not fire
(for the gun enthusiasts, I am not referring to some fully-automatic
weapons with free-floating firing pins such as the M-16 which in
approximately 1 in 100,000 cases, when chambering a round will fire
without the trigger being pulled, but that\'s a different story
altogether).

It appears from the tenor of your question that you don\'t know much
about handguns. You should probably learn more. It might help you to
feel safer if you understand how they work.
