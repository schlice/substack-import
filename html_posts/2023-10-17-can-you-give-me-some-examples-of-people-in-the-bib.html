"Blessing" is treated differently depending on what word is used, and
whether you are referencing the Old or New Testament.

In some cases in the Old Testament, "blessing" referred to material
wealth. For example, in Genesis 24:35 Abraham's servant tells Laban,
"The Lord has blessed my master abundantly, and he has become wealthy."
And in Job 42:12 we are told: "The Lord blessed the latter part of Job's
life more than the first. He had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand
camels, a thousand yoke of oxen and a thousand donkeys." In these
instances blessing is expressed through wealth and possessions.

But the Old Testament also makes it clear that there is much more to
God's blessing than material possessions. Psalm 132:15 promises that God
will bless Zion with abundant provisions and satisfy her poor with food.
Psalm 37:11 promises that "the meek will inherit the land and enjoy
great peace." In these instances there is still the promise of earthly
goods, but it goes hand in hand with a special concern for the poor. And
the people in Old Testament times learned that they could experience
God's blessing even in the most difficult circumstances. The lives of
individuals like Ezekiel, Daniel, and Esther are examples of how God may
use difficulty and suffering to his faithful servants\' advantage and
benefit.

In the New Testament, however, "blessing" is never shown through
material wealth. In Luke 6 Jesus says, "Blessed are you who are poor,
for yours is the kingdom of God" (v .20) and, "But woe to you who are
rich, for you have already received your comfort" (v. 24). James tells
us that the brother in humble circumstances should take pride in his low
position and that the rich man will fade away as quickly as a wildflower
(1:9-11). And Paul warns us that the love of money is a root of all
kinds of evil (1 Tim. 6:10).

The New Testament uses one word more than any other when describing
God's blessing to people. This word, µακαριοσ, or makarios, means
"blessed." It's used 44 times in the New Testament. Of those, 31 involve
descriptions of righteous behavior or characteristics that God considers
desirable. The most prominent and familiar example of this usage of the
word makarios is in the beatitudes in Matthew 5. Here Jesus blesses the
poor in spirit, the mourning, the meek, the merciful, the pure in heart,
and the persecuted. Luke 6 declares a blessing on the poor, the hungry,
the weeping, and the hated. In parables about servants behaving
responsibly while their masters are away, Jesus repeatedly blesses those
servants who are ready and watching when their master returns. James
blesses the person who perseveres under trial (1:3), and the book of
Revelation blesses the reader who is faithful to the message being
proclaimed (22:7).

Eleven uses of the word makarios speak of the blessing of being part of
the coming kingdom of God. Thus someone eating with Jesus in Luke 14:15
states that the person who will eat in the kingdom of God is blessed,
and Revelation 19:9 proclaims: "Blessed are those who are invited to the
wedding supper of the Lamb!" The final two uses of makarios refer to God
as the one who is blessed.

The New Testament idea of blessing, then, pictures people who rejoice in
the coming of salvation in Jesus Christ. They enjoy spiritual blessings
in Christ as they put their faith in Him, experience His love and
forgiveness, and work faithfully for the coming of His kingdom.

You may be wondering about a dangerous trend in modern Christianity,
called the **prosperity gospel.** The prosperity gospel is an unbiblical
Christian doctrine which teaches that faith can bring health, wealth,
and happiness into believers\' lives. It\'s also known as prosperity
theology, the health and wealth gospel, the gospel of success, or seed
faith.

The prosperity gospel teaches that:

- God wants people to be prosperous, especially financially
- Wealth is a sign of God\'s blessing
- The poor are poor because of a lack of faith
- Believers can transcend poverty and/or illness through devotion and
  positive confession
- Financial blessing and physical well-being are always the will of God
  for them
- Christian faith equates with material, and particularly financial,
  success

The prosperity gospel has its roots in an American occult tradition
called [[New
Thought](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=860306&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Thought){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}. It primarily took hold
in the Pentecostal revivals of the post-World War II years, and is
therefore frequently associated with Pentecostalism, Evangelicalism, and
Charismatic Christianity, although today these groups do not
*exclusively* preach the prosperity gospel. Some ministers who have
preached the prosperity gospel include Oral Roberts, Joel Osteen, Gordon
Lindsay, and Kenneth Hagin.
