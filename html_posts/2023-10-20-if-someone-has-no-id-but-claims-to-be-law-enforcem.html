If you mean "into your home," they need more than ID. They need a
*search warrant*.

Otherwise, you are under no obligation to open the door, let alone let
them into your home, **even if they are real police officers with real
ID**.

Believe me, if they have a search warrant, something as trivial as a
*locked door* is not going to stop them from coming in. So if they tell
you, "It's the police, we have a search warrant, open the door or we're
breaking it down," I suggest you open the door, or you're going to end
up with a broken door that you'll have to pay for. But if they say,
"Open the door, it's the police" and they don't have ID (or refuse to
show it) or a search warrant, you are under no obligation to open the
door.

I'd suggest calling 911 and preparing to defend yourself against a home
invasion.
