There are two methods to check to see if your phone is carrier-locked (a
firmware feature in the phone's operating system which forces the phone
to only connect on specific and defined networks, even if it is
physically capable of connecting to more).

This first method uses the phone's settings to try to connect to another
network. On iPhone, go to **Settings** \> **Carrier**. If "Automatic" is
checked, uncheck it. Allow it to search for carriers. On Android
(current versions), go to **Connections** \> **Mobile Networks \>
Network Operators**. Click "Search now" to have the phone search for
carriers.

If only one carrier is found, that's probably the carrier your phone is
locked to. If more than one carrier comes up, try to select a carrier
and make a call. If you can select multiple carriers and make calls,
your phone is unlocked. If your phone is carrier-locked, it will likely
not register on the other carrier's network.

This method doesn't always give you the 100% answer, because, for
example, you may be in an area where other carriers are unavailable.

The 100% answer can only be obtained by using SIM cards from multiple
carriers. For example, T-Mobile and AT&T use the same wireless radio
technology, so get a SIM card from each network. Power off the phone,
remove the SIM card, pop in the SIM card from the other network, and
power your phone on. If your phone is carrier-locked, the phone will
likely present you with an error message that says something along the
lines of, "SIM Card is not from \<carrier_name\>." If you don't get an
error message, try to make a call. If you are successful, then your
phone is unlocked.

If your phone is paid off, all carriers will unlock your phone for you
for free. Just contact your carrier's customer service department. When
they verify that your phone is fully paid off, they will provide you
with instructions and codes to unlock your phone from their network.
Some carriers have automated portals which will remotely unlock your
phone for you, but this is carrier-dependent.
