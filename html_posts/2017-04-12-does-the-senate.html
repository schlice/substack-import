In order to accurately answer this question, you have to understand the
purpose of the House and the Senate and what the framers intended for
them to do.

The House, composed of Congressmen who have smaller districts and
shorter terms, are representative of the "hot passions" of the people;
the feelings "at the time." The Senate, with longer terms and larger
constituencies, is supposed to be the "thoughtful, deliberate" body.
While the House limits debate, the Senate is adamant about allowing any
Senator the time he needs to debate the bill. Truly, the Senate is the
greatest deliberative body in the world.

Or, at least, it used to be.

Not soon after the Senate was founded, the Senators re-discovered the
old Greek and Roman practices of killing bills by killing time: the
filibuster. The filibuster was actually a fairly useful tool because it
*encouraged* healthy, productive debate. In order to move on from a
filibustered bill, it had to be resolved. This encouraged Senators to
engage in useful debate in order to move a bill forward, and then to
move on to other Senate business. Additionally, when a filibuster was
taking place, the Senator, for the most part, had to stay at his desk,
on his feet. The filibuster, then, was naturally self-limiting.

Two Senate rule changes changed this, and essentially and fundamentally
changed the Senate. In 1917, the Senate added a **cloture rule** which
allowed two thirds of the Senate present and voting to close debate;
later, this was changed to three fifths of the whole Senate. This rule,
in and of itself, was not a bad thing, as it still was in keeping with
the parliamentary procedures in the Senate. The Senate still encouraged
healthy debate, and still allowed Senators to speak, and if enough of
the body agreed, they could stop a filibuster. The filibuster was still
naturally self-limiting, so it was still seldom used. For 52 years after
the cloture rule was implemented, there were only 58 filibusters.

But in 1970, the number of filibusters *skyrocketed*, with a 36-fold
increase in the number of filibusters. Between 1970 and 2016, there have
been **1700** filibusters. This was caused by the implementation of the
**two track** system. Under this system, with the consent of the entire
Senate, or with approval of the minority leader, a filibustered bill
could be "tabled" (or set on a separate track) so that the Senate could
resume normal business. Now, the actual filibuster isn't even needed.
Just the *threat* of a filibuster could cause a bill to be tabled and
would effectively end debate on the bill. The House sends hundreds of
bills to the Senate, and the Senate is paralyzed. Any threats of
filibuster will cause debate on a bill (and ultimately votes on a bill)
to be ended.

This effectively turned the party of the opposition into the party of
the **roadblock**. It has also effectively turned the greatest
deliberative body in the world into an ineffective collection of
legislators, not because of a lack of desire to get bills passed, but
because of an unrepentant minority and the post-1970 filibuster.

I give this picture of the current state of the Senate because it frames
our discussion about the lowering of the needed vote count for cloture.
Debate is supposed to be a *means to an end,* not an end unto itself.
The Senate is chartered with making laws. Debate, therefore, should work
towards that end. Debate **which ends in a vote** is therefore good.
Debate which is designed not to end in a vote but to permanently prevent
a vote, or force the Senate to not fulfill its charter, is
counterproductive and instead of fostering debate, obstructs it.

The Senate **must** do its job. Using debate to prevent the Senate from
doing its job (*healthy, productive* debate and voting) is not in
keeping with what the founders designed the Senate to do: engage in
healthy debate, and vote on legislation (or Supreme Court nominees).
Lowering the threshold for cloture allows the Senate to move forward and
do their job, forestalling the effectiveness of the filibuster and
preventing it from being used as a hammer by the opposition in
preventing debate from even occurring in the first place.

Therefore, lowering the threshold for cloture is in keeping with what
the founders had in mind for the Senate.
