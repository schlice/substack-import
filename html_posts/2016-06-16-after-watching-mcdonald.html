To expound on the legal side of your question, you're trying to sue for
"false advertising." The legal definition of false advertising is when a
seller uses "confusing, misleading, or blatantly untrue statements when
promoting a product."

When the difference is ***cosmetic*** (as [[Cody
Dostal](https://www.quora.com/profile/Cody-Dostal)]{.qlink_container}
showed in his answer), this does not rise to the level of "confusing,
misleading, or blatantly untrue." You received a product which consisted
of exactly the same ingredients, in the same proportions, as the one
pictured in the ad. That does not constitute "false advertising."

Your case would be dismissed because you didn't meet the legal criteria
to establish that the respondent had committed false advertising.

You also haven't shown any damages that were done because your burger
didn't look like the one in the picture. You haven't suffered any
articulable damage, so your award would be nothing more than the cost of
the burger, even if you did win.

Then, you'd still have to pay McDonald's legal fees, which would be far
in excess of what you were awarded, because you didn't give the
restaurant a chance to correct their error.

So the whole exercise would do nothing more than cost you a lot of
money.

Ask them to make a burger that more closely resembles the one they
picture, or ask them to give you your money back. Don't waste your time
and money trying to sue them.
