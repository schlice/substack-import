**What is the meaning of this, you were a cup of tea but I drink
champagne now?**

The original phrase was, "You were my cup of tea, but I drink champagne
now." "My cup of tea" is a phrase which, when discussing a person as in
"you are my cup of tea," means that you are perfect for me, or that we
are a perfect match.

The original idea behind the phrase was that the speaker has moved on
from the listener to someone "more sophisticated" and "of higher
status," as champagne is generally considered to be a celebratory
beverage, consumed by those of higher social status than lowly tea,
which is consumed by nearly everyone and anyone. The speaker is trying
to intimate that he has "moved up" from the listener to someone
"better."

However, I must say that [[Kalli

meaning is just a perfect retort to the original phrase's meaning, using
qualities of the two drinks to indicate the position that the listener
believes the speaker has actually "stepped down" in leaving the listener
for the new person, who is actually "bubble-headed" as opposed to the
listener, who was "warm and perfect."
