**Content:** [Since they weren\'t actually convicted of anything,
you\'re not really going to find *statistics* that show those numbers.\
\
You might be better served looking for the number of unsolved murders in
the country. Then perhaps you could extrapolate a portion of the
population.\
\
But it won\'t be accurate, because one person can kill more than one
other person, go dormant for 10 years, and do it again. You could come
close, but you could never get accuracy.]{.rendered_qtext}
