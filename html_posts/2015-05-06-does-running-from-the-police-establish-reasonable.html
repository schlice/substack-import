**Content:** [For the most part, [[Jonathan
Books](https://www.quora.com/profile/Jonathan-Books)]{.qlink_container}
is correct. Running from the police alone is not probable cause. If you
are allowed to walk away from the police, who cares how fast you walk?\
\
However, in some \"high crime\" jurisdictions, some special waivers have
been enacted to help combat that crime which essentially say that
running from the police provides \"reasonable suspicion,\" which is a
lower level of proof required than probable cause, to stop said runner.
If the person was present in a high crime area, exhibiting all the
behavior of someone conducting criminal activity, and then they run when
the police arrive, that creates reasonable suspicion to stop that
person. A \"stop-and-frisk\" revealing evidence of the criminal activity
that the person is suspected of doing would then provide the needed
probable cause for arrest.\
\
Jonathan is not correct in saying that the person would then be required
to stop when the police yell stop because they were running in the first
place. Remember, if it\'s not illegal to run from the police, then if
they tell you to stop after you already started running, they have no
authority to do so (i.e. tell you to stop). If they didn\'t have the
authority to detain you, they certainly don\'t have the authority to
tell you to stop and wait for them (which is a form of detainment). In
that case, as long as they say the magic words \"Stop, Police!\", then
they can stop anyone from running, anytime, anywhere, perfectly legally.
Therefore, that is not necessarily true. It would add an aggravating
factor if the police already had a reasonable suspicion, but the police
saying the magic words isn\'t enough to create reasonable suspicion.\
\
(EDIT) I want to be clear about something. The fact that an officer may
not have the authority to tell you to stop ***is not an invitation to
continue to run, citing the officer\'s lack of authority as your
excuse!*** If an officer tells you to stop, STOP! The lack of authority
I mentioned is ONLY useful to your lawyer, who will use that information
to get all your charges thrown out, along with potentially providing
grounds for false arrest charges against the department.\
\
So to reiterate what I just said, if an officer tells you to stop, you
MUST stop. Let your lawyer determine if the officer had the authority to
do what he did. That\'s what we pay our lawyers for.]{.rendered_qtext}
