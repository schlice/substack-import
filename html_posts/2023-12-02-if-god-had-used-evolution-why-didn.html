Because God didn't use evolution.

Defining "evolution" is perhaps the greatest point of confusion in the
creation-evolution controversy. This is where Darwinian errors and false
claims begin to multiply if not checked by those who believe observation
is important to science.

Consider what happens to bacteria attacked by antibiotics. When bacteria
survive a bout with antibiotics and multiply, that surviving group of
bacteria may be resistant to that antibiotic. The surviving bacteria are
resistant to that antibiotic because the parent bacteria possessed the
genetic capacity to resist, or a rare biochemical mutation somehow
helped it survive (we say "rare" because mutations are nearly always
harmful). Since the sensitive bacteria die, the surviving bacteria
multiply and now dominate.

Darwinists say that the surviving bacteria have evolved. Having adapted
to the environment, the surviving bacteria provide us with an example of
evolution. Fair enough, but what kind of evolution? The answer we're
about to give is absolutely critical.

Here's what observation tells us: ***the surviving bacteria always stay
bacteria***. They do not evolve into another type of organism. That
would be macroevolution. Natural selection has never been observed to
create new types.

But macroevolution is exactly what Darwinists claim from the data. They
say that these *observable* micro changes can be extrapolated to prove
that *unobservable* macroevolution has occurred. They make no
distinction between microevolution and macroevolution, and thus use the
evidence for micro to prove macro. By failing to make this critical
distinction, Darwinists can dupe the general public into thinking that
any observable change in any organism proves that all life has evolved
from the first one-celled creature.

This is why it is essential that the right distinctions be made and that
all hidden assumptions be exposed when discussing the creation-evolution
controversy. So if someone ever asks you, "Do you believe in evolution?"
you should ask that person, "What do you mean by evolution? Do you mean
micro- or macroevolution?" Microevolution has been observed; but it
cannot be used as evidence for macroevolution, which has never been
observed.
