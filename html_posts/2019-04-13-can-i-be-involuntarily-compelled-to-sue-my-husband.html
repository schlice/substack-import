**Can I be involuntarily compelled to sue my husband who is also a
victim of the actual defendant and if so, would that in itself be a
claim for which relief could be granted?**

No, for multiple reasons.

1.  You can't be compelled to sue your lawful spouse. First of all, at
    common law, you can't sue your spouse because legally, a married
    couple is considered a single entity. This is referred to in common
    law as "spousal immunity." While some states have laws against suing
    your spouse, most states only carve out exceptions where spousal
    privilege doesn't apply.
2.  You can't be compelled to sue anyone. Whether or not you sue is up
    to you. There is no legal mechanism that can compel you to file a
    lawsuit against someone, and I can't find any relevant case law
    where someone was compelled to sue someone else against their will.
