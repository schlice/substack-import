*Question Details:*

*I took them because they make me really sleepy and I needed to sleep
cause I want to die (slept 8 hours). From what I\'ve read so far, it
seems that I shouldn\'t be worried but I\'m feeling a little breathless?
Is this normal? Or will I fine? Also this isn\'t my prescription, its my
mothers. I\'m 17.*

The part about mirtazapine doesn\'t stick out to me.

The part that sticks out to me was \"I needed to sleep cause I want to
die.\"

You don\'t need to worry about mirtazapine. You need help. Now.

Look up at the top of this page. There is a box that starts with
\"**There Is Help.**\" Depending on your location, contact one of those
resources. Now. You need help, they can help you.

(EDIT) It appears that Quora's "There Is Help" box is not appearing on
some mobile devices. For the sake of completeness, I will reproduce the
information here.

As for mirtazapine (Remeron), it is a drug that needs to build up in
your body in order to be effective. So long-term, you\'ll probably be
fine from an overdose of mirtazapine. I would probably go to the ER if I
were you. If you do go to the ER, please tell them why you took so much
mirtazapine. They will help you from there.

But even if you don\'t go to the ER, please please please please call
the appropriate number up at the top of this page. Those folks are
miracle workers and they really do want to listen to you. Please call
them now.

Like seriously, stop reading this and call them.

Now.
