Not really. Because while you can *conceive* of an infinite number of
things, you can't actually *have* an infinite number of things.
Infinity, in this context, is outside of the realm of the physical.

For example, you can conceive of an infinite number of points between
two bookends, but you can't put an infinite number of books between
those bookends. That's the difference between the abstract (which we can
conceive in our imagination) and the concrete (what we have on earth).

This, by the way, forms the basis of the *Kalam Cosmological Argument*
which proves that the universe had a beginning:

1.  An infinite number of days has no beginning and no end.
2.  But today is the end of history (history being a collection of all
    days).
3.  Therefore, there was a beginning to history (i.e. there were not an
    infinite number of days before today).

Because the timeline has an end, it must have had a beginning. The Law
of Noncontradiction says that something is either eternal, or it is not
eternal. Because our timeline has an end point, it is not eternal.
Additionally, you cannot add anything to an infinite number, but we will
add another day to history tomorrow. Therefore, logically, history is
not infinite.

The mind of God is even more difficult to conceive of. While again, we
can conceive of an infinite number of points on a mathematical line, we
simply cannot conceive of an infinite mind, one which knows everything
and is wholly complete.

Our human minds cannot grasp what an infinite mind must be like. We can
*imagine*, but even what we can conjure up in our imagination *pales in
comparison* to God's actual infinite mind.

The Bible echoes this thought:

> "For my thoughts are not your thoughts,\
> neither are your ways my ways,"\
> declares the Lord.\
> "As the heavens are higher than the earth,\
> so are my ways higher than your ways\
> and my thoughts than your thoughts." --- Isaiah 55:8--9 NIV

We simply cannot fathom the infinite mind of God.
