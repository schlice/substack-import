**Are jury trials really fair when then the case involves complex
scientific or medical testimony? Wouldn\'t it be better to use people
with a background in science or medicine?**

Let's re-phrase this question into more modern terms and see if it makes
sense.

"Are jury trials really fair when the case involves women's rights
issues? Wouldn't it be better to use only women?"

"Are jury trials really fair when the case involves issues which only
exist in the black community? Wouldn't it be better to use all blacks?"

"Are jury trials really fair when the case involves religious
discrimination? Wouldn't it be better to use all Muslims?"

When you phrase it that way, it seems a little less fair when we limit
jury selection based on the issues in the case.

What makes a "jury of your peers" fair has nothing to do with the
juror's knowledge of pertinent issues, or sharing the defendant's race
or sex or religious conviction. A jury of your peers is fair when
everyone on the jury is "your peer."

A "jury of your peers" is a phrase which dates back to the Magna Carta,
and it basically meant "a jury of fellow citizens." While the
Constitution does not use the phrase (the Constitution only calls for
"an impartial Jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall
have been committed"), courts have interpreted the philosophy in jury
selection to mean that the jury must include a broad cross-section of
society, to include all races, genders, and national origins.

Courts are not required to include jurors who match your race, gender,
or national origin in order to make a fair "jury of your peers," but
they cannot exclude jurors simply on the basis of those identifying
characteristics. See *Batson v. Kentucky* for more information about
jury selection and removing jurors from a jury.
