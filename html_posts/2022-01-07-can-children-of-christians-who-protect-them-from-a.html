I think it's funny that you believe that children who grow up in a
Christian household never experience sin.

> "You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'You shall

Are you saying that these kids have never been angry with a brother or
sister? Because according to Jesus, that's a sin, just like murder.

And "getting into heaven" isn't just accomplished by "rejecting sin,"
even though that's a part of it for sure. Repentance and belief are the
requirements. Those things are indeed easier for kids who grow up in
Christian households.

Original question:

Can children of Christians who protect them from anything non-Christian
go to heaven even though they don't get the chance to "reject sin" so to
speak?
