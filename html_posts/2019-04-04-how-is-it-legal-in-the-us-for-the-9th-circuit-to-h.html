**How is it legal (in the US) for the 9th Circuit to have blocked a
Presidential order?**

The Constitution.

Article III of the Constitution says that a federal court can decide an
Executive Order case when there are "Controversies to which the United
States shall be a Party." The Supreme Court has interpreted this to mean
that plaintiffs who can claim a true "injury in fact" caused by the EO
are allowed to bring cases.

If a plaintiff can show a true injury caused by the EO, a federal judge
can rule that the EO is either illegal or unconstitutional. That ruling
can, of course, be appealed to the Supreme Court, who would have the
final say.
