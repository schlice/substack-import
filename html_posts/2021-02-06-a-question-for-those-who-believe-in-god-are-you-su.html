**A question for those who believe in God. Are you sure that He is good?
Why or why not?**

That's an interesting question. I'd ask a follow-on question so that I
could properly answer the question.

*What is good?*

Who gets to define what is good? This, of course, will lead you to
understand whether or not God is good.

Those who do not believe in God probably define goodness themselves. And
God's choices for your life may not necessarily fit your definition of
"good."

For those of us who believe in God, the answer is simple. God is good,
because he *is* the embodiment of goodness. He is the very definition of
good. Everything that he does simply qualifies as good, just because he
does it.

We may not like his choices. But that doesn't change whether or not they
are good.

For example, we may not like spinach, but it is good for us. Therefore,
it's hard to argue that spinach isn't ultimately good (even though we
may dislike it while we're eating it).

God is the same. We may not agree with, or even like, what he tells us
to do. He may take our lives down some very difficult paths. But
ultimately, what he does with our lives is good for us as a whole. It's
good for the furtherance of the church. It's good for advancing his plan
to gather more of his people back to him. And it's hard for us to see
that what he does with our lives is ultimately good, especially while
we're going through the unpleasant times (or the times we wouldn't
necessarily categorize as "good"). This doesn't change the fact that
what he does is ultimately good.
