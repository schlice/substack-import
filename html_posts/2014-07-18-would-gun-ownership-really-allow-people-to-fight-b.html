**Content:** [Would it make a difference? Would an oppressive regime
think twice about the losses \*they\* would suffer if they tried to make
armed impositions against their own people? With respect to the US it
makes no sense, but thinking outside the box, would an oppressive regime
be more apt to commit crimes against its own people if it knew they were
(mostly) unarmed, the law-abiding citizens anyway.\
\
As Matt Pickering also mentioned, every despot and dictator who came to
power made sure that anyone who wished to oppose them didn\'t have the
power and/or ability to do so. In the vast majority of cases, this was
by first disarming the populace.\
\
The US was formed with the idea that we should always be able to
overthrow the government (although that would be tenable these days at
best), so the ability of the people to keep and bear arms was codified
in our laws at the founding.]{.rendered_qtext}
