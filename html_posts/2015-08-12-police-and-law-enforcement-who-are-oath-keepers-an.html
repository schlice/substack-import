**Content:** [To answer your second question, in Missouri, anyone who
has a concealed carry permit can then open carry any weapon anywhere in
the state. Missouri says, \"Yeah, if you want to open carry, you have to
concealed carry first.\"\
\
I get the concept. Concealed carry permits require training and money
(meaning that they are inherently unfair and discriminatory; those that
have the money and the time to get them will have them), so only those
people are trained enough to carry a rifle.]{.rendered_qtext}
