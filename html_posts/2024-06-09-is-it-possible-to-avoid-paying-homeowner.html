Of course there is! There is always an option!

The way you avoid paying the HOA dues which you find too expensive is:
**don't buy the property.**

Seems that everyone wants to have their cake and eat it too, and if the
house you want is in an area controlled by an HOA, you either buy the
house and pay the dues, or you don't buy the house and don't pay the
dues. It's really that simple.
