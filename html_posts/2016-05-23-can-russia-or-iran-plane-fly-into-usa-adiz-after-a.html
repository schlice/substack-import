Let's dissect this question

***Can Russia or Iran plane fly into USA ADIZ (after all, it is an
international airspace)***

Of course. And as long as they have a valid flight plan on file, no one
will bat an eye.

***and tested their missile peacefully ?***

WHAT????? Firing missiles from aircraft??? You realize that firing
missiles from aircraft when you are not within the borders of your
sovereign airspace is potentially an act of war, don't you? And
depending on what you're shooting at, you could be within your own
sovereign airspace and it could ***still*** be an act of war (for
example, if you're shooting at a US aircraft overflying your nation on a
valid flight plan). The only place aircraft ever fire missiles when
***not*** in actual combat is in live-fire missile ranges, and those are
well known and broadcast well ahead of time.

Other missiles that are test-fired are *declared* to the international
community. At the very least, any nation firing anything into the sky
would want to let the US know, because we know all/see all (thanks,
NORAD) and you wouldn't want the US to accidentally nuke you because
they thought you were shooting at them. 99.9% of the time, when a
missile is fired, our intelligence community is already well aware that
it was going to happen.

Of course, it's that 0.1% that makes you nervous.
