Pre-sex contracts are unenforceable because there are two consenting
parties present and actively involved in the "transaction" and they
should be fully aware of what they are doing, along with the
consequences of those actions. Even when one of the parties does not
consent (i.e. rape), child support can still be ordered by the court
even though parental rights will likely be involuntarily terminated.
Even statutory rape does not alleviate the necessity to provide child
support once the participant is old enough to do so legally. Again,
parental rights are not terminated automatically in such a case.

Generally, divesting yourself of parental responsibility is difficult
because children are generally understood to have a right to a parental
relationship and, particularly, a right to receive financial support and
care from both parents. Child support is a state-level function, and the
state can mandate it, even in the presence of criminal activity, using
the "child's rights" argument.

The ***only*** time that you can really give up parental rights before
conception is when you *anonymously* donate to a sperm bank. Your
identity is technically known to the sperm bank, but you are anonymous
to the recipient.

Being a ***participant*** in the sex act implies consent to support
whatever children are produced from that union, according to the state.
A contract may not alleviate you of the obligation to care for that
child which you may create.

While it can be done, voluntary termination of parental rights is
difficult at best. More likely than not, it will more readily be
approved if the custody of the child goes to someone else who will care
for it. But that whole pesky "best interest of the child" thing means
that the state has a vested interest in ensuring children are cared for
by someone, and like I mentioned previously, it is generally understood
that children have a right to a parental relationship.

Finally, your argument about "you don't need two parents" is
biologically unsound. Unless you picked up sperm from a sperm bank and
were artificially inseminated, there was a male present who participated
and who is on the hook to provide parenting.
