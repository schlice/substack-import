  eat again. I exercise about 5 days a week, but I was wondering if any of these balance
  or educational problems could be passed down if I were to have a child?"'

Only your genetic<br>pattern is passed to your children; injuries your body has sustained do<br>not alter your genome. There may be some injuries that could alter some<br>cells, but your DNA pattern can\'t be injured, and is present in every<br>one of your body\'s cells. That\'s the beauty of the DNA structure of<br>your body.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
