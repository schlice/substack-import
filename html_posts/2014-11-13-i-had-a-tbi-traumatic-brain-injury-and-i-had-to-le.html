answer, your TBI does not affect your genetic makeup. Only your genetic
pattern is passed to your children; injuries your body has sustained do
not alter your genome. There may be some injuries that could alter some
cells, but your DNA pattern can\'t be injured, and is present in every
one of your body\'s cells. That\'s the beauty of the DNA structure of
your body.]{.rendered_qtext}
