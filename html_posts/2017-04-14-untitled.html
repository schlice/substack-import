You are correct, you are not permitted to intervene. The best you can do
is to record the situation and provide it to the person so that he and
his lawyers can use it as evidence if they decide to press charges.

But let's be fair: you really believe that police are going to handcuff
a person and continue beating him? That's just stupid, and it's illegal.
Cops know this, and they also know that there are no fewer than 10 cell
phone cameras recording their every move every time they step out of
that car, so they know that they better be on the straight and narrow
when people are around.
