**If a police officer asks to search my diabetes bag, should I let him
or her?**

When I had to carry needles, they came pre-packaged and pre-filled. Each
needle was in its own blister pack. I transported the needles inside the
blister pack (so it was clear what was inside) and along with it, I
transported the prescription for the same medication.

Police know about diabetes. I don't think you'll be in for too much
hassle so long as you have your insulin with your other supplies and
hopefully a prescription card (which you should also have).
