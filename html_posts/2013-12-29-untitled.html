<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [The problem is not whether or not it\'s okay from entering
into a contract. Two people are allowed to sign a contract guaranteeing
each other survivorship rights and parental responsibilities (that\'s
called adoption) and anything else that marriage confers on you, and
that\'s perfectly legal. But the government doesn\'t call that a
marriage.\
\
The question is: what business does the government have in regulating
marriage in the first place? Why does the government care whether or not
ANY two people get married?\
\
The answer has to do with WHY we have marriage in the first place. By
the way, this is all about government marrying people, not churches.
Religion does what it wants, and the Constitution protects that, and no
one is asking to change religion. We\'re simply talking about the
\"marriage license\" issued by government. Does the government marry
people because they recognize loving relationships? Do they do so to
confer survivorship benefits? Part of the problem here is that marriage
has been so long understood as what it is that it\'s hard to explain why
it is what it is. We\'ve never really had to do that before.\
\
So why do we have marriage in the first place? Governments marry people
because **sex between men and women regularly produces children**.
That\'s it. That\'s why we have marriage. The fact that sex between men
and women can produce children is why the government marries people: to
provide for the generativity of sex. It has nothing to do with love. It
has nothing to do with human rights (since there is no basic human right
to marry). It has nothing to do with bigotry or any other form of
discrimination. The only interest government has in regulating marriage
is to provide for the generativity of children.\
\
This tends to pose a lot of questions, like \"what if a man and a woman
can\'t have kids?\" or \"what if a man and a woman choose not to have
kids?\" If you say that those two can marry and *not* have kids, then
two men or two women can marry and still be okay because they don\'t
produce kids either. And that is true, but marriage is based on the fact
that a man and a woman can biologically \"mate;\" two men or two women
cannot thus biologically \"mate.\"\
\
The answer really boils down to this: Marriage is about kids. Marriage
exists so that adults structure their lives in such a way to make the
best possible outcome for children. This is the government\'s
overarching interest in this debate, nothing else matters. It\'s all
about children. Changing the definition of marriage would not only erode
the already fractured tie between parents and children, but it would
essentially place the law behind the idea that believing that such a tie
should exist in the first place is bigoted.\
\
The idea that because there are so many broken homes and broken
marriages that we should further erode the definition of marriage is
lunacy. This should be a clarion call to FIX marriage, not to destroy it
further.]{.rendered_qtext}
