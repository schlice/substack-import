<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [The problem is not whether or not it\'s okay from entering<br>into a contract. Two people are allowed to sign a contract guaranteeing<br>each other survivorship rights and parental responsibilities (that\'s<br>called adoption) and anything else that marriage confers on you, and<br>that\'s perfectly legal. But the government doesn\'t call that a<br>marriage.\<br>\<br>The question is: what business does the government have in regulating<br>marriage in the first place? Why does the government care whether or not<br>ANY two people get married?\<br>\<br>The answer has to do with WHY we have marriage in the first place. By<br>the way, this is all about government marrying people, not churches.<br>Religion does what it wants, and the Constitution protects that, and no<br>one is asking to change religion. We\'re simply talking about the<br>\"marriage license\" issued by government. Does the government marry<br>people because they recognize loving relationships? Do they do so to<br>confer survivorship benefits? Part of the problem here is that marriage<br>has been so long understood as what it is that it\'s hard to explain why<br>it is what it is. We\'ve never really had to do that before.\<br>\<br>So why do we have marriage in the first place? Governments marry people<br>because sex between men and women regularly produces children.<br>That\'s it. That\'s why we have marriage. The fact that sex between men<br>and women can produce children is why the government marries people: to<br>provide for the generativity of sex. It has nothing to do with love. It<br>has nothing to do with human rights (since there is no basic human right<br>to marry). It has nothing to do with bigotry or any other form of<br>discrimination. The only interest government has in regulating marriage<br>is to provide for the generativity of children.\<br>\<br>This tends to pose a lot of questions, like \"what if a man and a woman<br>can\'t have kids?\" or \"what if a man and a woman choose not to have<br>kids?\" If you say that those two can marry and *not* have kids, then<br>two men or two women can marry and still be okay because they don\'t<br>produce kids either. And that is true, but marriage is based on the fact<br>that a man and a woman can biologically \"mate;\" two men or two women<br>cannot thus biologically \"mate.\"\<br>\<br>The answer really boils down to this: Marriage is about kids. Marriage<br>exists so that adults structure their lives in such a way to make the<br>best possible outcome for children. This is the government\'s<br>overarching interest in this debate, nothing else matters. It\'s all<br>about children. Changing the definition of marriage would not only erode<br>the already fractured tie between parents and children, but it would<br>essentially place the law behind the idea that believing that such a tie<br>should exist in the first place is bigoted.\<br>\<br>The idea that because there are so many broken homes and broken<br>marriages that we should further erode the definition of marriage is<br>lunacy. This should be a clarion call to FIX marriage, not to destroy it<br>further.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Why-are-gay-people-asking-for-the-right-to-marry-If-it-is-legal-stuff-they-are-asking-for-cant-they-go-to-some-separate-setup-for-partners/answer/Corregan-Brown<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
