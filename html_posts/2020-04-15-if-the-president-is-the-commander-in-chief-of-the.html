**If the President is the commander-in-chief of the US military, what is
the role of the Secretary of Defense?**

An excellent question! The role of Commander-in-Chief is defined by the
Constitution, and the role of Secretary of Defense is defined by Federal
law.

According to the **Constitution**, the President is Commander-in-Chief
of the Armed Forces and Chief Executive of the Federal government.
According to **Federal law**, the Secretary of Defense is the "Principal
Assistant to the President in all matters relating to the Department of
Defense" and has **statutory authority** to lead the Department and all
of its component agencies, *including military command authority second
only to the President*. Relevant statute is 10 USC ยง 113.
