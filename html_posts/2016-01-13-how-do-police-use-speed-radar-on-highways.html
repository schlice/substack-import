When a vehicle is sitting parallel to the direction of travel, and
clocking traffic, it\'s usually because the vehicle has a *built-in*
radar system. It consists of three parts: two radar transceivers, and a
dash-mounted control unit. The control unit is capable of maths that
allow the unit to run while the police vehicle is in motion, clocking
speeds of vehicles in front of, and behind, the patrol car, while it is
in motion.

This photo shows the front transceiver and the control unit. There is a
similar transceiver mounted on the rear deck of the patrol vehicle.

If the patrol vehicle is sitting *perpendicular* to the flow of traffic,
he theoretically could be clocking traffic in *either* direction.
However, if we\'re to apply a little logic to the situation, it is far
more likely that he is using LIDAR out the passenger window so that he
can proceed forward into traffic to stop a speeder. I wouldn\'t use that
as logic to speed past him if he is facing into the opposite lane of
traffic, though. Nothing says he can\'t back up and follow you.
