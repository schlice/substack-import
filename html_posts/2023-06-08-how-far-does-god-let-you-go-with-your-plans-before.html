He lets you go as far as He wants to let you go. Because even in letting
you move forward with your own plans, He is fulfilling His plan.

Ultimately, there is no scenario in which He does not fulfill His plan
for you, regardless of how far you go, and how long you live, with your
own plans.

The question becomes: **how long are you going to fight against His
plans for you?**

Doesn't it just make sense to submit to His will *now*?
