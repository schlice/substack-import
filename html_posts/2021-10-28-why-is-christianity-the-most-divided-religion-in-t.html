Ultimately, even though the various Christian sects may disagree on the
finer points of the faith, **the gospel** remains the same throughout
any religion or sect which claims itself to be Christian. In fact,
Christians are *allowed to have differences of opinion* on non-essential
doctrine:

In other words, it is necessary for a church which claims to be
Christian to believe that Jesus Christ is God, one of three persons in
the Trinity, and that he died as a penal substitution for us and our
sins.

Really, the only thing we need to do in order to define whether or not a
religion or sect is Christian is to determine who they say Jesus is.

Yes, among Christian sects (which really exploded in the United States
in the 19th century following the [[Second Great
Awakening](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7a3720&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Great_Awakening){.external_link

disagreements on certain details such as *sola scriptura* (only the
Bible as the source of God's inerrant word) and *sola fides* (only faith
saves you instead of faith plus works). But that alone doesn't make them
less Christian.

Why is Christianity the most divided religion in the world with diverse
doctrines and believes that sometimes contrast, the only thing all
denominations have in common is believing in Jesus?
