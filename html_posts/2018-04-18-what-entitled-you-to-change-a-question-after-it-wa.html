**What entitles you to change a question after it is answered? This is a
violation, and should not happen.**

We should be able to edit the question to correct for grammar (this is
especially common for non-native English speakers). There's nothing
wrong with editing the question for clarity. If we did not have the
ability to edit the question, we'd have to report every question which
was not worded correctly (which automatically downvotes the question)
and Quora Moderators have enough to deal with when it comes to the stuff
they deal with now, let alone having to edit questions for grammar or
clarity.

*Changing* *the original intent* of the question is not correct. The
edit should be reported if the original intent of the question is
changed.

If someone is changing the question simply because they don't like the
question, they should be reported.

Finally, in Quoraville, **questions belong to the community, not solely
to the asker. Answers belong to the answerer.**
