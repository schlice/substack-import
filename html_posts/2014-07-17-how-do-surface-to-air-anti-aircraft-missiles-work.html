**Content:** [The missiles have active guidance systems on board that
guide the missile to the target. While there are several different kinds

**heat-seeking** missiles. The one assumed to have shot down the
Malaysian Airlines aircraft would presumably have been a radar-guided
missile.]{.rendered_qtext}
