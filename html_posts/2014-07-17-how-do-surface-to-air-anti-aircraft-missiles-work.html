<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The missiles have active guidance systems on board that<br>guide the missile to the target. While there are several different kinds<br>of anti-aircraft missiles, the two most common are radar-guided and<br>heat-seeking missiles. The one assumed to have shot down the<br>Malaysian Airlines aircraft would presumably have been a radar-guided<br>missile.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
