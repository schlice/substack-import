**How does the shutting down the asylum claims and deploying the
military to the border solve the illegal immigration problem?**

It doesn't "solve" the illegal immigration problem. It helps the US
focus efforts elsewhere.

First of all, the US didn't "shut down" asylum claims. The US said, "If
you want to make a claim of asylum, you have to do it at a border
checkpoint, or you have to be on an active or expired (within five
years) visa. In other words, you either have to present yourself to CBP
at a border crossing, or you must be in the country legally. You can no
longer be in the country illegally and apply for asylum.

If you are found in the country illegally, you will be deported. You can
come back to a border crossing to make your asylum claim.

Adding military personnel to supplement CBP also helped the issues at
the border. It didn't "solve" anything.

Nothing will be "solved" until both sides come to the table and
***HONESTLY*** discuss illegal immigration. Neither side wants to
honestly discuss the issue. Until that happens, the problem of illegal
immigration isn't going to be solved.
