Considering his most recent statement about the war, Trump would urge
Israel to *hurry up and conclude its conflict with Hamas*.

Trump gave comments to *Israel Hayom* [[in an exclusive
interview](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1ff710&url=https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/03/25/trump-to-israel-hayom-only-a-fool-would-have-not-acted-like-israel-on-oct-7/){.external_link

yesterday. He first claimed that Biden's presidency contributed to the
conflict:

> He \[Biden\] can\'t talk. He\'s a very dumb person. He\'s a dumb
> person. His foreign policy throughout 50 years has been horrible. If
> you look at people that were in other administrations with him, they
> saw him as a weak, ineffective president, they \[Hamas\] would have
> never done that attack if I were there.

Trump then noted that the disinformation campaign being waged by Hamas
is actually hurting Israel's reputation, and he recommends that they
conclude the conflict:

> You have to finish up your war. To finish it up. You gotta get it
> done. And, I am sure you will do that. And we gotta get to peace, we
> can\'t have this going on. And I will say, Israel has to be very
> careful, because you\'re losing a lot of the world, you\'re losing a
> lot of support, you have to finish up, you have to get the job done.
> And you have to get on to peace, to get on to a normal life for
> Israel, and for everybody else.
