**Why is it illegal that President Donald Trump\'s campaign has spent
nearly \$100,000 of donor money to pay legal bills to the firm
representing Jared Kushner?**

It's not.

The article sure does make it seem like it is though, doesn't it?

But nowhere in the article can you find what law may have been broken.

There's a reason for that. Because there is none.

Here's why it's not only perfectly acceptable, but legal, for the RNC to
pay for Kushner's legal counsel:

Kushner worked for the campaign. Kushner is named as a defendant in a
lawsuit brought by the DNC regarding his work on the campaign. The
campaign is covering his legal expenses in responding to that lawsuit.

Simple.

This is yet another example of the mainstream news media trying to make
a story where there is none.
