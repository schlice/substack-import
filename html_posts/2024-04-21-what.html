So let me get this straight. You think God should condition His love to
*others* based on how they treat *you?* Did I understand that right?
Doesn't that sound a bit *conceited* to you?

The truth is that God's love is ***unconditional***. That means "no
conditions." He loves all of us equally. There is nothing you can do to
make Him love you less. There is also nothing you can do to make Him
love you *more*. He loves you when you do good, and He loves you when
you don't do as much good. There are literally no conditions on His
love.

So let's go back to your very first question: ***what is God's love
worth?***

The answer is that God's love is *priceless*. It's priceless, which
means it has no price. There is nothing you can pay to gain God's love.
I never have to do anything to merit God's love. He loves me *despite*
my sin. He loved me *even when I was still a sinner.*
