Nothing, because there is no law against saying the word "gay."

Don't believe everything the liberal sphere tells you.

**"Don't Say Gay" is a fabrication. Completely made up.**

Our friends at The Tampa Bay Times explained it:

> The bill as originally filed prohibited school districts from
> encouraging "classroom discussion" about sexual orientation or gender
> identity in "primary grade levels." Opponents of the bill interpreted
> that provision to be a ban on speaking about LGBTQ topics in
> classrooms and started using the "don't say gay" moniker.
>
> The bill's sponsors, Sen. Dennis Baxley, R-Ocala, and Rep. Joe
> Harding, R-Williston, amended the bill in the hopes of making it clear
> it would only be restricting lessons related to those subjects.
> Conversations between students and teachers about, for example, a
> child's two mothers, would still be allowed under the bill, the
> sponsors said.
>
> But the nickname stuck.[\[1\]](#jWYTB){#cite-jWYTB .citation_link}
