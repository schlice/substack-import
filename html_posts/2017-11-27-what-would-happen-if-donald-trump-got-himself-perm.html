Once the country recovered from the uncontrollable fit of laughter that
it found itself in, the President would go on national television and
publicly deride Twitter, rightly calling it by its true moniker: the

without Twitter.

The President would then announce that his public tirades would
henceforth be taking place on Instagram and Facebook.
