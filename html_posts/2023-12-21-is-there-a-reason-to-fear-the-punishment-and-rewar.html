No! None whatsoever!

I think the best way to look at it is this:

If you believe that, at the end of your life, you will simply blink out
of existence, and you will just be gone, like what happens to you when
you are unconscious, **then that is what will happen to you when you
die.**ยน You will simply blink out of existence. You're not *actively
sinning for the sake of rejecting God* (because then there may be some
issue of punishment). You just don't believe that any of it is real.
You're not actively rejecting God because you don't believe that God
exists. You just live your life, and you die.

For those of us who believe in a creator God, and who believe in His
salvific work on our lives, we will be saved, and we will not simply
blink out of existence. We will get to spend *eternity* with Him.

BUT, I will say this:

If you at all are curious or worried or wondering about a punishment,
you are experiencing *conviction*. Your conscience is telling you that
there might be something out there that you ought to think about. If you
are **at all** convicted, you owe it to yourself to investigate whether
or not there is anything to this religion thing. Ignore the religious
nuts. They'll be screaming about "fire and brimstone," and while there
are some nuggets of truth to what they say, their "method of delivery"
of that message is a little harsh. But there are some logical, rational
reasons to believe that a creator God exists and we should learn more
about Him.

If you want to learn more about that possibility, literally take fifteen
minutes out of your life and [[watch this

ยน I'm fully aware that this view is unbiblical. I'm also fully aware
that atheists do not care one whit for what is biblical.
