No, military members should not be allowed to break their service
commitments if they don't want the vaccine.

Members were fully aware of the types of exemptions for vaccines which
were available at the time they enlisted, and none of those exemptions
are changing now. Members are free to exercise their rights to use any
of those exemptions if they so choose. Vaccines did not become mandatory
until they were fully approved by the FDA, so there can no longer be an
objection about an "unapproved" vaccine.

Members who are not under any Active Duty Service Commitment (ADSC) are
free to separate at any time. ADSCs are incurred upon certain events,
such as the military paying for your college, or when you sign an
enlistment contract.

In other words, there is no reason that they should get an extra
opportunity to breach their contract or lessen their ADSC due to this
vaccine.
