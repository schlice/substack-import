**What happens if one juror says not guilty?**

As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."

In most cases, juries must reach a unanimous verdict. In all Federal
cases, the jury must be unanimous. In state cases, nearly all states
require unanimous verdicts in criminal trials. State civil trials are
the exception. About a third of US states allow just a majority vote to
find for the petitioner. Some states have a set dollar amount below
which a majority is allowed, and above which the finding must be
unanimous.

If one juror says not guilty when a unanimous vote is required, you have
what is called a "hung jury." What happens after a hung jury depends on
the court and the type of case. In some cases, a list of questions can
be produced which the parties must answer in a supplemental hearing. And
in other cases, the judge may declare a "mistrial."

In a civil mistrial, it's up to the petitioner to decide if they want to
start from scratch and re-try the case. In a criminal mistrial, the
prosecutor can choose to dismiss the charges entirely, or re-try the
case. The prosecutor could also approach the defense with a plea deal in
order to not re-try the case.
