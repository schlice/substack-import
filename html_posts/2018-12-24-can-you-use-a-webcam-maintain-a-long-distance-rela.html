**Can you use a webcam maintain a long-distance relationship with your
cat or dog while away at school?**

The answer: in most cases, no.

Most computer monitors and televisions run at a 60 Hz refresh rate. This
means the image refreshes (or changes) 60 times per second. Human eyes
can be fooled at around 50 Hz, so we see a continuous, smooth image. If
it falls below 50 Hz, we don't see a smooth image. We see flickering
images and annoying lines.

Dogs generally have better eyesight than we do, and will see nothing but
flicker until about 75 Hz. So unless you're using a high-end gaming
monitor at 144 Hz or higher, it's unlikely your dog will be able to see
you clearly.

Also, dogs aren't going to sit and watch an image that's not at their
eye level, so you'll have to set your high-end gaming monitor on the
floor.

So in the case of the dog, it is possible, but in order to do it, you
have to have a gaming PC with a graphics card capable of generating over
75 Hz and a monitor capable of displaying such an image. Those aren't
cheap. For the full gaming rig at decent quality, you can expect to
spend at least \$1500. Most gamers have standard rigs that run about
\$2000, on average, with some custom rigs running even higher than that.

Cats, on the other hand, can see images on a standard 60 Hz TV. However,
cats are easily bored and are disinterested in human pursuits, so it's
unlikely you'll be able to attract their attention, let alone be able to
interact with them. But it's worth a try.
