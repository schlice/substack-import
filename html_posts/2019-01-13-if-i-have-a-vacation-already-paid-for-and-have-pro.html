**If I have a vacation already paid for and have proof can I get out of
jury duty? Jury duty is in the middle of my trip.**

In most jurisdictions, there are two types of excusal from jury duty:
postponement, and disqualification.

Postponement of your jury duty can happen for any number of reasons,
including that you already have scheduled plans to be out of town. It\'s
very simple to request a postponement, and in most jurisdictions, you
can do it online.

On the other hand, disqualification as a juror means that you don\'t
have to serve during that term at all. There are only a small number of
reasons that a juror can be disqualified; for example, if the juror
cannot read, write, or speak English fluently enough to effectively
serve, or if the juror has a disqualifying disability.
