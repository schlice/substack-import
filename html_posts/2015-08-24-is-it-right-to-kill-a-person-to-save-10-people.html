**Content:** [Since you didn\'t specify in your answer, I will provide
you with a few different perspectives.\
\
Overall, the answer is \"it depends.\"\
\
Is it **legally** right to kill a person to save 10 people? *Probably,
but varies depending on where you are.* If you are in an area where
legal guns are prohibited, and you kill someone, using a gun, to save
ten others, you have still broken the law to do so. So whether or not it
is legally right to kill a person in order to save 10 people is
dependent on where you are at that moment. Additionally, are you killing
one person who is **directly threatening** 10 people, or are you killing
one person (such as a political leader) because someone else is holding
the lives of 10 people ransom? This action would definitely not be
legal, because the definition of defense of others only includes using
force to defend others who are directly being threatened.\
\
Is it **morally** right to kill a person to save 10 people? It depends
on your view of morality. What is one life worth? Does a person lose
worth if they threaten the lives of 10 people? Should that person have
the right to continue living if they threaten the lives of others? What
if you feel that it is immoral to take anyone\'s life, ever, regardless
of what actions they are taking? In that case, you would feel that it is
better to let 10 people die than for you to take a
life.]{.rendered_qtext}
