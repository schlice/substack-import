**Is there a principle of law that says that the House needed to use the
courts to coerce witnesses, that they needed to make a serious effort,
before declaring obstruction?**

Yes, it is the principle of Separation of Powers.

The House (part of the Legislative Branch) attempted to use subpoenas to
force the White House (part of the Executive Branch) to give testimony
and documents. While the Legislative Branch has subpoena power under
their Constitutional directive to be able to impeach, the Executive
Branch has Executive Privilege, which allows advisers to freely talk to
the President without fear that those conversations will leak outside
the White House.

Both the Legislative and Executive Branches have equal powers under the
Constitution.

The Judicial Branch must sort out whose privilege takes precedence in
any particular case.

Obstruction was a silly charge because the Executive Branch was
exercising its Constitutional authority to withhold privileged
information. The courts should have been engaged to rule on those
subpoenas (which is what happened in the last two impeachments), but the
House chose to not take them to court.
