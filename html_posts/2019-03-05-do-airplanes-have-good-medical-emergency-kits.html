**Do airplanes have good medical emergency kits?**

Answer: Yes.

According to FAA Advisory Circular AC121--33B, all aircraft will carry
an Emergency Medical Kit (EMK). This kit can be used to aid onboard
medically-trained personnel with an in-flight emergency. The equipment
in an EMK can be used to sustain a life until the aircraft can land
safely and the person can be medically evacuated.

Also in the same FAA regulation is the required contents of the EMK:

As you can see, the EMK has airways, needles for injectables,
antihistamines (for anaphylaxis), dextrose (for diabetic emergencies),
nitroglycerine tabs (for heart attacks), lidocaine (for local numbing),
inhaled bronchodilators (for asthma attacks), tourniquets, CPR masks and
resuscitation bulbs, aspirin, and saline and IV tubing.

Along with the EMK, most aircraft are also equipped with an automated
external defibrillator (AED) to correct arrhythmia until the patient can
be medically evacuated.

Together, it's a fairly comprehensive kit that should be able to keep a
person alive until the aircraft can land and meet an ambulance.
