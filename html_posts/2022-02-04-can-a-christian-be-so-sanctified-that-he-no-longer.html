Probably not. No one has the capability to be sinless, by our human
nature.

But we can probably be so sanctified that while we may still
unintentionally sin, in our thoughts and in our words, in what we have
done, and what we have failed to do, that we recognize it right away,
and we can address it with God.

God knows our hearts. He knows our capabilities, because he designed
them. He knows what we are capable of doing. He leads us through
sanctification so that we can *recognize* our sinful nature, *prevent*
sin as much as we can, and *repent* for the rest.

We should, however, rest assured that there will continually be sin.
Only one was ever sinless, and only one will ever be sinless. We are
always human, we are always fallen, and we will always sin. But we
always improve, and we always repent.
