If the prosecutor wanted to try for manslaughter, he would have tried
for manslaughter. Manslaughter is a **lesser included offense** of
murder. If he tried for murder and the defendant was acquitted, the
acquittal includes any of the lesser included offenses of murder (e.g.
if he tried for murder 1, you could not then subsequently try for murder
2, manslaughter, or any other lesser included offenses related to
unlawfully taking a life) because double jeopardy would attach.
