(This answer is specific to the United States)

In the US, disability is governed by a piece of legislation called the
**Americans with Disabilities Act**. It defines a person with a
disability as

- a person who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially
  limits one or more major life activities.
- a person who has a record of such an impairment, even if they do not
  currently have a disability.
- a person who does not have a disability but is regarded as having a
  disability.

If your surgery impairs one or more major life activities, you are a
person with a disability.

**Major life activities** include, but are not limited to, caring for
oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping,
walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning,
reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working.
