<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [The problem we have in this country is that you\'re not<br>actually a \"reckless person\" in the eyes of the law until you actually<br>use a gun in the wrong way. So there is no way to know that I\'m going<br>to act \"recklessly\" until I do. So keeping guns out of the hands of<br>the reckless is harder than you make it sound.\<br>\<br>With all the required training and government regulation of cars, we<br>should, following the same logic, have far fewer deaths from cars than<br>we actually do, and deaths from cars are the #1 accidental killer in<br>this country, causing more deaths than the next four causes combined,<br>and shootings aren\'t even in the top five. Licenses are heavily<br>regulated and training and testing are mandatory, so why do we still<br>have so many deaths from cars when they\'re not even designed to kill?<br>Where is the outrage at the auto industry for making such an unsafe<br>product?\<br>\<br>The hypocrisy in your answer is palpable.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-of-the-adage-Guns-dont-kill-people-People-kill-people-Do-you-think-it-truly-settles-the-gun-ownership-issue/answer/Joe-Geronimo-Martinez<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
