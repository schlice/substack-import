<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [The problem we have in this country is that you\'re not
actually a \"reckless person\" in the eyes of the law until you actually
use a gun in the wrong way. So there is no way to know that I\'m going
to act \"recklessly\" until I do. So keeping guns out of the hands of
the reckless is harder than you make it sound.\
\
With all the required training and government regulation of cars, we
should, following the same logic, have far fewer deaths from cars than
we actually do, and deaths from cars are the #1 accidental killer in
this country, causing more deaths than the next four causes combined,
and shootings aren\'t even in the top five. Licenses are heavily
regulated and training and testing are mandatory, so why do we still
have so many deaths from cars when they\'re not even designed to kill?
Where is the outrage at the auto industry for making such an unsafe
product?\

The hypocrisy in your answer is palpable.]{.rendered_qtext}
