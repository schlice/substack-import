(US Answer Only)

A blockchain-verified vote does not overcome the problems which cause a
direct voting system to be inefficient for the United States.

Additionally, the verified vote using blockchain simply says that the
vote was not tampered with in transit. It does nothing to address the
fact that someone could still steal your password and impersonate you
and send your vote.
