Short answer: yes and no. Also bear in mind that this is a general
answer; laws may be different from state to state. Always consult with a
licensed attorney in your area.

You may be able to make the case in civil court that the person
responsible for the leaking of the personal information is financially
responsible for the damages caused by such a leak. That's not a terrible
stretch, and the purpose of the civil court is the renumeration of
financial losses, so the case can be made.

Criminally, you are only responsible for the crime you committed, not
the crimes that others commit. You could be charged with criminal
negligence in allowing the identity theft to take place, but that's
still not a charge of identity theft, because that person did not commit
identity theft. Generally, you are only responsible for the crimes you
personally commit. There is one exception I know of off the top of my
head: the felony murder rule. Let's say you and your four closest
friends are robbing a bank in the middle of the night. A security guard
startles one of your cohorts and he shoots and kills the guard. All five
of you are on the hook for the murder. If, during the commission of a
felony, a murder is committed, everyone committing the felony can be
charged with the murder, even though only one person committed the
murder.

Beyond that, you are only criminally responsible for the crime you
committed. So the person leaking your personal information would be
responsible for whatever crime caused him to come into possession of
your personal information in the first place, and possibly criminal
negligence in allowing the identity theft. The person who took the
information and committed identity fraud would be responsible criminally
for the identity fraud.
