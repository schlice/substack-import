**Is there any technology product (radars, cameras, etc) to prevent
scratching my rims when parallel parking?**

Many current model year vehicles have awesome 360 degree camera systems
which give you a birds-eye view over the top of your car while you're
parking:

They do this by using small cameras mounted in the front and back, and
on the two side mirrors. They then digitally "stitch and stretch" the
images from those four cameras to produce that cool 360 degree view you
see while parking. As you note in the image, the picture is always on
while the car is in reverse. But you can push the "360" button above the
screen to turn the cameras on when you're not in reverse and moving
below 10 miles per hour, such as when you're parallel parking.
