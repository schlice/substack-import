**How do I file a complaint against a deputy sheriff?**

It's easy. Just visit the Sheriff's Office.

You will have to swear to your statement. This means you will have to
sit in an interview room, fill out your complaint, show proof of
identity, and then swear that your statement is true to the best of your
knowledge, and acknowledge that you can be prosecuted for knowingly
giving a false statement to the police. Just be aware you must do this.

You must also be aware that there are always three sides to every story:
your side, his side, and the truth, which is usually somewhere between
the two sides. The truth is most generally not in anyone's story because
reality is colored by our view of it, which includes our biases as well
as physiological issues which cause us to remember things differently
than they happened. Therefore, while you may issue a complaint, the
results of that complaint are up to the department to address. Perhaps
the deputy will be counseled. Perhaps he will need to attend additional
training. Or, if there is a group of people who have gone though the
effort to file a complaint, perhaps the deputy will be officially
reprimanded, or maybe investigated. But not always. You must accept that
the best you can do is to file a complaint, unless you plan on retaining
an attorney and suing the department because you believe the deputy
violated your rights or the law.

*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.
Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a
civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not
misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously. My mental well-being
isn\'t worth your harassing, inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I
wrote, tough shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is
un-cited opinion masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m
wrong, write your own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site,
not a debate site. If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually,
you\'re wrong,\" don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment.
Put anything vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be
followed by a block and a mute, and a BNBR report. I will do this
immediately and with no compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*
