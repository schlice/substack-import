**How do the NORAD toilets work?**

If I had to try to understand this question, I would probably think that
you're asking how is wastewater handled in NORAD. I'm assuming you're
not asking how the toilets in the bathrooms work, because they are
regular bathrooms with sinks and urinals and toilets and they all work
like regular sinks and urinals and toilets.

The short answer is that black water and gray water are pumped via an
underground buried pipeline to nearby Fort Carson, and is sent to their
sewer system for treatment. Drinking water comes from a natural spring
which was discovered while digging out the facility. Clean spring water
overflow is discharged either directly out the side of the mountain or
is discharged into Fountain Creek, or is used to carry any remaining
effluent into the Fort Carson pipeline.

Here are the details on the system [[from the
EPA](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cf8d0d&url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-10/documents/co-0034762-cmafs-sob-pn-2016-b.pdf){.external_link

for Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station, the actual name of the Cheyenne
Mountain Complex. Interestingly, it took **40 years** to get the EPA to
approve that "NPDES permit" which allowed us to discharge **untreated
natural spring water** out of the side of the mountain. We literally
discharged natural spring water overflow into the Fort Carson sewage
pipeline for 40 years because we didn't have the permit to discharge out
of the side of the mountain. Note that this is overflow from a 1.5
million gallon drinking water tank. Sheesh.
