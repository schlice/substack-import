Your question hints at an entire science of air fluidity called
[[***wake
turbulence***](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b9c095&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake_turbulence){.external_link

entire article here; you should read up on it. It's actually fascinating
stuff.

Suffice it to say that there are varying degrees of time aircraft must
wait for the wake turbulence to clear before they are allowed to take
off under International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) rules.
