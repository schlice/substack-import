**In states with legal recreational cannabis, does the law enforcement
have a way of knowing if your weed is legal or from the black market?**

*(Answer is specific to Colorado; other states may have different
rules)*

No, and in short, they don't care. Only sellers are regulated, the
product itself is not regulated.

Since only the marijuana retailers are regulated, not the actual product
itself, law enforcement's only concern with users is their compliance
with consumption laws (i.e. you have to be old enough to use it, you can
only use it in your house, you still can't drive under the influence,
etc). Once you have it, they don't care where it came from.

Think about it. You can grow it yourself. How are they ever going to
know where you got it from?
