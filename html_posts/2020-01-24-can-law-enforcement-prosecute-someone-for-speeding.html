**Can law enforcement prosecute someone for speeding with only a verbal
confession?**

First of all, law enforcement doesn't prosecute anyone. District
attorneys prosecute criminals.

Law enforcement collects evidence of a crime, and if the District
Attorney believes there is a case to be made, they prosecute the crime.

Finally, speeding, in most cases, isn't a "crime" but a traffic
infraction. You don't go to jail for speeding, in most cases. The
exceptions (where you would go to jail) are when your speed and your
driving rise to the level of "reckless endangerment," where you
recklessly put other peoples' lives in danger.

If there were other witnesses to your recklessness, and you confessed to
the speed, you could be prosecuted for reckless endangerment.

But just a confession? If I was a DA, I wouldn't prosecute that. I'd
need more evidence before moving forward, especially to support a charge
of reckless endangerment.
