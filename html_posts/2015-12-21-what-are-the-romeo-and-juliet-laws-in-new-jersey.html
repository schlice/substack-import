New Jersey law says that you are guilty of sexual assault if sexual
intercourse occurs with an alleged victim who is at least 13 but younger
than 16, *and the accused is "at least four years older" than the
alleged victim.* This portion of the New Jersey statute is called the
\"close in age\" clause, and it says that if you are within four years
in age, you are considered \"close in age\" and not eligible for
prosecution under this statute. The \"close in age\" clause protects
teens engaging in consensual sex from prosecution and registration as
sex offenders.

Therefore, according to the statute, if you are 18 and your girlfriend
is 15, you meet the \"close in age\" portion of the New Jersey law, and
you would not be eligible to be charged with sexual assault.

NOTE: I am not a lawyer. I am not telling you that you are
**guaranteed** to never be charged. I am merely providing information on
the New Jersey sexual assault statute. If you are accused of sexual
assault against a minor, you would have to find help from an experienced
criminal defense attorney in New Jersey.

Note that I\'m also not telling you whether or not your relationship is
a good idea. You are 18, I leave that for you to decide. However, it
might be in your best interest to hold off on sexual activity until your
girlfriend turns 16, at which point you are both able to consent under
New Jersey law, and there is no possibility that you can be charged with
sexual assault against a minor. Also bear in mind that if you turn 19
before she turns 16, you **can** be convicted. My only advice to you:
wait until she turns 16.
