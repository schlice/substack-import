Not quite accurate.

The Bible specifically says, "the wages of sin is death." But is that
passage talking about *physical* death? Of course not. Everyone dies,
our physical bodies were not meant to live forever. We're talking about
*spiritual* death.

Remember that the Bible also says that before we were saved, we were
"dead in our sin."

> As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins, in which
> you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the
> ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in
> those who are disobedient. All of us also lived among them at one
> time, gratifying the cravings of our flesh and following its desires
> and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature deserving of wrath. But
> because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us
> alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions---it is by

Before we were saved, we were *dead*. But once we are saved, we are
"made alive with Christ even when we were dead in our transgressions."

The Bible tells that death is the punishment for sin. Do you agree? Are
