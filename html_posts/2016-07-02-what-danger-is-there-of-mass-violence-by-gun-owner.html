The danger is mostly silly talk.

What would most likely happen is that overnight, the government would
create millions of new criminals.

First, in order to do this, you'd either need a radical
re-interpretation of the Second Amendment (and it is radical if you look
in comparison to the original intent of the authors of the Constitution)
or a wholesale repeal of the Second Amendment. The former might be
doable (but fraught with legal challenges for decades); the latter is
next to impossible. But for hypothetical argument's sake, let's assume
that it happened.

*Banning* *guns* means a few different things. You could make it illegal
to purchase a gun. This wouldn't have any effect on existing gun owners,
though. *Ex post facto* laws (laws which make previous activities
illegal) are also forbidden by the Constitution. If it was legal to
purchase guns when I made the purchase, making it illegal now doesn't
affect me.

Making it illegal to keep guns in your home (again, a Constitutional
violation, but we're talking hypotheticals here) would simply create a
new class of criminals. The vast majority of people would make a choice:
do I comply with the law, or do I sit tight and become a criminal? Since
the law would be nearly impossible to enforce without also violating the
fourth and fifth amendments as well, most gun owners would probably
leave their guns in their gun safes (right where they were before) and
wait it out.

So I wouldn't expect the "blood in the streets" scenario that the
crazies like to talk about. But I would expect that you would see a
brand new law that most gun owners would simply fail to follow. Unless
you also throw out the other Constitutional protections of citizen's
rights from government overreach, and once you did that, you did
door-to-door searches and included scans of the property with
ground-penetrating radar, such a law would be next to impossible to
enforce.
