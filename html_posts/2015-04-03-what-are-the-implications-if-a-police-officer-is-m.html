**Content:** [This is also why EVERY member of a tactical entry team
will be sounding off with \"Police! Search warrant!\" during a warranted
entry. Their entry is very loud, and it is generally very difficult to
prove that you didn\'t know that it was the police entering, as all of
them were yelling \"Police! Search warrant!\"\
\
The only time this does not happen is during a \"no-knock warrant\" and
those are very judiciously granted, knowing the significant danger that
it puts everyone involved in. \"No-knock warrants\" are the ones in
which the police do not do what I said in the last paragraph. They enter
without announcing their presence first. No knocking, no announcing
their presence, no identifying. No-knock warrants are used in situations
where the police are attempting to stop someone from fleeing or
destroying evidence, so stealth and rapid forced entry are key.\
\
The intersection of the no-knock warrant and the castle doctrine is a
dangerous intersection, indeed.]{.rendered_qtext}
