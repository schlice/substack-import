**Is it possible to hack an iPhone to make some minor changes for
personal use?**

Yes, it's called "jailbreaking" your iPhone. There is at least one
jailbreak that I know of that works on current iPhones:

[[unc0ver](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=214447&url=https://unc0ver.dev/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="unc0ver.dev"}]{.qlink_container}

Do keep in mind: **jailbreaking your iPhone, while not illegal, will
void your warranty.** So if you are still within your one-year warranty
period, don't do this. Also, loading Apple-unapproved software opens you
up to the possibility of

- damaged hardware
- security holes which could expose your personal data
- data unavailable or data loss

Don't jailbreak your phone unless you know what you're doing. You risk
"bricking" your phone (i.e. turning it from a phone to a "brick").

OK, now with the official warnings out of the way, there's your answer.
