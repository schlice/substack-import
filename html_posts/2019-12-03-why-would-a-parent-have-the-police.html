**Why would a parent have the police \"fake arrest\" their small
child?**

Because they are cruel, selfish parents who want to give up the
parenting job and let the state be the big bad parent. They don't want
to be the "bad guy" and would rather have the police act as the bad guy.

In case you're not following, **this is a terrible idea**.

It's a terrible idea for a number of reasons. The first is the one I
already mentioned: parents want to abdicate their role as the rule-maker
and turn that role over to the police. They want to be their child's
"friend" instead of being their child's "parent." Children are looking
for parents, not friends. They have plenty of friends at school. Be a
parent first.

Second, it teaches young children to fear the police, which is exactly
the opposite of what you want to teach a young child. This doesn't mean
that we should indoctrinate children to always trust police officers
because they're always good people, but it does mean that you can't
teach a child that a police officer is someone to be "feared." For
example, a child goes missing and the police are out looking for him.
The child will not come out of hiding when police call him for "fear" of
getting "in trouble" and being "arrested." Again, not something we want
to teach young children.

Finally (and not insignificantly), abdicating parental responsibility to
the state increases the power of the state and weakens the family unit.
It is thinking like this which will eventually destroy the family unit,
the basic unit of learning and indoctrination of life skills we have in
society. If you're a fan of the type of Orwellian government of *1984*,
then this is right up your alley.

Parents: if you think you want to have the police "fake arrest" your
children, think again. Don't tell your kids that they have to eat their
vegetables or the policeman will come arrest them. Don't tell your kids
that they'd better sit still and not disturb everyone else in the
restaurant or the policeman will come arrest them. This is bad
parenting.
