When the Reedy Creek Improvement District was implemented, Florida
desperately wanted to become more than just the home for Florida Man and
endless swamps and the place people go to retire. The deal with Disney
gave them far more power than a theme park operator should ever have,
but at great benefit to them and to the state. For all intents and
purposes, it put Florida on the map as a tourist destination.

Fast-forward to today. Disney retains that power that a theme park
operator should not rightly have, and Florida has grown *outside of*
Disney. Sure, the continued existence of Disney is exceedingly
important, but it only provides about half of Florida's tourist revenue.
RCID has become a *hindrance* in many respects to the state, and has
been a thorn in its side as of late. Tallahassee has been waiting for an
opportunity to have the chink in DIsney's armor exposed.

And Bob Chapek, in his infinite wisdom, conveniently highlighted their
chink.

The next iteration of special district for Disney will happen, but this
time it will be the state dictating the terms. Disney doesn't have a leg
to stand on; they're not a side show attraction that they can pack up in
a week and move to a new location. Disney has bet the farm on Florida
for the Walt Disney World Resort, arguably the crown jewel in the Disney
Parks portfolio. They've invested way too much money to abandon it now,
and now they're committed.

So as the Florida law says, RCID will be dissolved and a new special
district will be built in its place. It will still allow much of the
self-governing that they had before (the RCFD and the city services will
remain, just under new management), but the state will have a lot more
influence in *how* things are done, not necessarily the day-to-day
management of the property. The future growth of Disney will now be much
more of a *partnership* between Disney and Florida, whereas in the past
the future growth of Disney was *solely* in the hands of Disney, and
Florida could do little but look on and adapt accordingly. Now,
Florida's interests can be included alongside Disney's interests.

In short, Disney had an airtight deal, and that deal was DIsney's to
lose.

What are your thoughts on the Florida Senate voting 23-16 in favor to
strip Disney of its self-governing status?
