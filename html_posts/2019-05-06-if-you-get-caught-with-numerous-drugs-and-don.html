**If you get caught with numerous drugs and don't take you to jail or
even give you a ticket, can you be charged for it later?**

The short answer is yes, they can, but it's likely that they won't.

Legally, they have up to the statute of limitations in order to charge
you with a crime. For example, if you are caught for possession but
never charged, the district attorney has up to the statute of
limitations in order to charge you with that crime.

However, if they had you, but they let you go, it's usually because they
chose to not prosecute that crime. If they made that choice now, it's
not likely they'll change their mind in the future.
