Yeah, too bad for that. However...

**18 U.S. Code ยง 702 - Uniform of armed forces and Public Health
Service**

Whoever, in any place within the jurisdiction of the United States or in
the Canal Zone, without authority, wears the uniform or a distinctive
part thereof or anything similar to a distinctive part of the uniform of
any of the armed forces of the United States, Public Health Service or
any auxiliary of such, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not
more than six months, or both.

That's the Federal law prohibiting people from wearing the uniform
without authority. An affirmative defense to this is to cite the 1st
Amendment, and you generally can avoid being charged.

However, if you wear the uniform while not a military member ***and***
attempt to extract some form of personal gain, you are now engaging in
***theft of service*** which is prosecutable everywhere. 1A won't
protect you when you try to extract some gain from impersonating a
military member.
