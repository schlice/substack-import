By we, do you mean you and your ten friends?

You'd have to do a lot better than that to impact Fox's viewer base. As
of February 2023, Fox News was the ***most watched cable news network in
the United States*** with 2.2 million viewers tuning in during
primetime.

But by all means, vote with your wallet, and encourage all your friends
to do the same. That is the only way you can make a difference.

But you can't *force* anyone else to do the same.
