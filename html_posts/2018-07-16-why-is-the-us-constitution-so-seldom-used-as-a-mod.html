**Why is the US Constitution so seldom used as a model by other
nations?**

Because *a Constitution cannot create democracy.*

Democracy must first exist among the people, and the people have to be
prepared to be the final arbiter of governmental overreach. In other
words, a government which is subservient to the will of the people must
both exist and be able to be checked by the will of the people.

In far too many cases, a constitution is drafted following US
constitutional ideals, but the requisite will of the people to keep the
government in check is simply not there to the degree necessary to
actually do so. According to research by the [[The University of Chicago
Law
School](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5bee7c&url=https://www.law.uchicago.edu/news/lifespan-written-constitutions){.external_link

constitution in the wild is only 17 years.
