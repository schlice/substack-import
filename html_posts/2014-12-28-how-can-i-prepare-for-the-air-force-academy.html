<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *Question Details:*<br>><br>> *I am a freshman in high school and I am very good at math and<br>> science. I love aerospace and aeronautical engineering and want to<br>> learn what I should do to enhance my knowledge on these subjects. I am<br>> specifically interested in becoming a fighter pilot or flying a plane<br>> such as the U2 dragon lady, but I have a small case of astigmatism<br>> (will this eliminate my chances of being a pilot?).*<br><br>You have two questions:<br><br>1.  How do I best prepare for attending the Air Force Academy, and<br>2.  Will my astigmatism eliminate my chances of being a pilot<br><br>I\'ll answer the second question first for reasons that will become<br>clear in a moment. From our friends at<br>[military.com(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8ce0e7&url=http://military.com){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="military.com"}]{.qlink_container}:<br><br>> Air Force flight training has strict vision requirements. The vision<br>> requirements are 20/50 for pilots and 20/200 for navigators. Vision<br>> for both must be correctable to 20/20. Applicants who have a history<br>> of Photo Refractive Keratectomy (PRK), Radial Keratotomy (RK), or<br>> Laser In-Situ Keratomileusis (LASIK) are ineligible for aviation duty.<br><br>So if your astigmatism is correctable to 20/20 and is no worse than<br>20/50 uncorrected, you\'re good to go.<br><br>You\'re already on a great path because you stated you\'re very good at<br>math and science. Even if you don\'t attend a service academy, STEM<br>resources in our country are severely lacking, so I would encourage you<br>to pursue something in that field in any case.<br><br>Some things that will be very important for your future acceptance into<br>the Academy:<br><br>1. Get Good Grades<br><br>You\'ll get nowhere in the selection process if you\'re not in the top<br>10-20% of your high school class. The Academy takes \"the best of the<br>best\" to be cadets. Make sure you are doing your best at all high<br>school subjects, not just math and science. There are two numbers which<br>make up your *Academic Composite*: your Prior Academic Record (PAR), and<br>your SAT/ACT scores. The Admissions Board will automatically take the<br>combination of SAT/ACT scores which gives you the highest overall score,<br>so make sure you don\'t just take the test once if you didn\'t do well<br>on a particular area. SAT/ACT scores are weighted higher than your PAR<br>in your Academic Composite score.<br><br>2. Participate in Extracurricular Activities<br><br>As I mentioned earlier, the Academy takes the \"best of the best.\" You<br>would normally consider such students as \"student-athletes\" because<br>they excel in academics and also are good athletes as well. Your<br>*Extracurricular Composite* score is based on your athletic and<br>non-athletic participation in school, community, and work. As well as<br>athletic achievement, the Board looks at community service and work<br>history as well. Be active in your community, your church, or your<br>neighborhood. Volunteer for activities. Show qualities of good<br>character.<br><br>These two scores (Academic Composite and Extracurricular Composite) are<br>added to a third score derived by the Selection Committee. They use<br>Character Assessment items such as your writing sample, the results from<br>your ALO (Academy Liaison Officer) interview, and your fitness test.<br>Everything in your admissions file is considered in evaluating the<br>\"whole person.\" This evaluation determines your *Selection Composite*.<br>The three scores are weighted this way:<br><br>- Academic Composite: 50%<br>- Selection Composite: 30%<br>- Extracurricular Composite: 20%<br><br>This quantitative analysis of your admission file is then given a<br>qualitative, or holistic review evaluating the entire file, and a<br>qualitative recommendation for admission is given. These two<br>recommendations (quantitative and qualitative) are combined with the<br>needs of the Air Force, and any legislative requirements at the time to<br>determine if a candidate is selected for an appointment.<br><br>Along with appointment, candidates need to be nominated.<br>Nominations, while not guaranteeing admission into the Academy, are<br>essential, as no cadet can enter without one. There are several<br>nomination groups, and each has its own specific requirement. For<br>example, the most commonly used nominating group is Congressional. Each<br>Member of Congress can have up to 5 cadets in the Academy at any one<br>time. Slots open up any time a cadet leaves the Academy (either through<br>graduation or otherwise). A Member of Congress can nominate up to 10<br>individuals for any one of his allocated slots. Some advice from the<br>Academy on Congressional nominations:<br><br>> You should request a nomination from both of your U.S. Senators and<br>> your U.S. Representative. Each has considerable latitude in awarding<br>> nominations; however, most are based upon some combination of academic<br>> achievement, leadership performance and athletic participation.<br>> Members of Congress want to nominate outstanding individuals from<br>> their states or districts who will have the best chance to qualify for<br>> appointment. While you must be a legal resident of the state or<br>> congressional district in which you are applying, it is not necessary<br>> to know your Member of Congress personally.<br><br>You can get more information about the nomination process from the<br>[[Academy<br>Admissions](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=fcee9b&url=http://www.academyadmissions.com/admissions/the-application-process/nominations/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="academyadmissions.com"}]{.qlink_container} website.<br><br>3. Have an Open Mind<br><br>To illustrate what I\'m talking about, let me tell you a little bit of<br>my Academy experience.<br><br>Dateline: August, 1993. The Air Force is in the middle of a<br>\"drawdown,\" a period of military reduction following war (in this<br>case, Desert Storm). Because the Air Force has reduced the number of<br>active aircraft in the inventory, they have a profusion of pilots, and<br>no cockpits for them to occupy. Pilots are assigned to non-flying AFSC<br>(Air Force Specialty Code) jobs. Additionally, they slow down entrance<br>into UPT (Undergraduate Pilot Training). My class (the Class of 1994)<br>has well over 1,000 PQ (Pilot Qualified) cadets, and the Air Force<br>shrinks the total number of pilot slots available for my class to<br>225.<br><br>We are brought into Arnold Hall (specifically, into the theater) and<br>given the \"good news.\" They gave us an extra week to decide if we<br>wanted to stay or go, because instead of everyone who was PQ going, only<br>roughly one out of every four PQ cadets were going to go to UPT.<br><br>You might be surprised to learn that hardly anyone left (I believe it<br>was around 5-7 cadets who decided to leave on account of this).<br><br>What we knew then, and what you should know now, is that *your job in<br>the Air Force is not the most important result of your Academy career*.<br>You are an Air Force Officer first, and an AFSC second. The Academy<br>produces the finest caliber *Air Force Officer* that it can. It doesn\'t<br>produce the finest *pilot*, or the finest *maintenance officer*, or the<br>finest *cryptologist*, or the finest *scientist* or *engineer*. Yes,<br>graduates in those fields are certainly exemplary, but the Academy<br>produces Air Force Officers of character. Hardly anyone in my class left<br>the Academy because they knew that they were there to become Air Force<br>officers, not just pilots. Your job is to be the best officer you can<br>be, then to be the best \<insert_your_AFSC_here\> you can be.<br><br>I hope this gives you a little bit of the information you\'re looking<br>for. Be sure to read the [[Admissions<br>website](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0267f0&url=http://www.academyadmissions.com/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="academyadmissions.com"}]{.qlink_container} to get the whole<br>story and to track and monitor your admissions path. Everything you need<br>to get started is there.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
