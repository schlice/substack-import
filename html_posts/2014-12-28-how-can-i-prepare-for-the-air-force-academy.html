You have two questions:

1.  How do I best prepare for attending the Air Force Academy, and
2.  Will my astigmatism eliminate my chances of being a pilot

I\'ll answer the second question first for reasons that will become
clear in a moment. From our friends at

So if your astigmatism is correctable to 20/20 and is no worse than
20/50 uncorrected, you\'re good to go.

You\'re already on a great path because you stated you\'re very good at
math and science. Even if you don\'t attend a service academy, STEM
resources in our country are severely lacking, so I would encourage you
to pursue something in that field in any case.

Some things that will be very important for your future acceptance into
the Academy:

**1. Get Good Grades**

You\'ll get nowhere in the selection process if you\'re not in the top
10-20% of your high school class. The Academy takes \"the best of the
best\" to be cadets. Make sure you are doing your best at all high
school subjects, not just math and science. There are two numbers which
make up your *Academic Composite*: your Prior Academic Record (PAR), and
your SAT/ACT scores. The Admissions Board will automatically take the
combination of SAT/ACT scores which gives you the highest overall score,
so make sure you don\'t just take the test once if you didn\'t do well
on a particular area. SAT/ACT scores are weighted higher than your PAR
in your Academic Composite score.

**2. Participate in Extracurricular Activities**

As I mentioned earlier, the Academy takes the \"best of the best.\" You
would normally consider such students as \"student-athletes\" because
they excel in academics and also are good athletes as well. Your
*Extracurricular Composite* score is based on your athletic and
non-athletic participation in school, community, and work. As well as
athletic achievement, the Board looks at community service and work
history as well. Be active in your community, your church, or your
neighborhood. Volunteer for activities. Show qualities of good
character.

These two scores (Academic Composite and Extracurricular Composite) are
added to a third score derived by the Selection Committee. They use
Character Assessment items such as your writing sample, the results from
your ALO (Academy Liaison Officer) interview, and your fitness test.
Everything in your admissions file is considered in evaluating the
\"whole person.\" This evaluation determines your *Selection Composite*.
The three scores are weighted this way:

- Academic Composite: 50%
- Selection Composite: 30%
- Extracurricular Composite: 20%

This quantitative analysis of your admission file is then given a
qualitative, or holistic review evaluating the entire file, and a
qualitative recommendation for admission is given. These two
recommendations (quantitative and qualitative) are combined with the
needs of the Air Force, and any legislative requirements at the time to
determine if a candidate is selected for an **appointment**.

Along with appointment, candidates need to be **nominated**.
Nominations, while not guaranteeing admission into the Academy, are
essential, as no cadet can enter without one. There are several
nomination groups, and each has its own specific requirement. For
example, the most commonly used nominating group is Congressional. Each
Member of Congress can have up to 5 cadets in the Academy at any one
time. Slots open up any time a cadet leaves the Academy (either through
graduation or otherwise). A Member of Congress can nominate up to 10
individuals for any one of his allocated slots. Some advice from the
Academy on Congressional nominations:

> You should request a nomination from both of your U.S. Senators and
> your U.S. Representative. Each has considerable latitude in awarding
> nominations; however, most are based upon some combination of academic
> achievement, leadership performance and athletic participation.
> Members of Congress want to nominate outstanding individuals from
> their states or districts who will have the best chance to qualify for
> appointment. While you must be a legal resident of the state or
> congressional district in which you are applying, it is not necessary
> to know your Member of Congress personally.

**3. Have an Open Mind**

To illustrate what I\'m talking about, let me tell you a little bit of
my Academy experience.

Dateline: August, 1993. The Air Force is in the middle of a
\"drawdown,\" a period of military reduction following war (in this
case, Desert Storm). Because the Air Force has reduced the number of
active aircraft in the inventory, they have a profusion of pilots, and
no cockpits for them to occupy. Pilots are assigned to non-flying AFSC
(Air Force Specialty Code) jobs. Additionally, they slow down entrance
into UPT (Undergraduate Pilot Training). My class (the Class of 1994)
has well over 1,000 PQ (Pilot Qualified) cadets, and the Air Force
shrinks the total number of pilot slots available for my class to
**225**.

We are brought into Arnold Hall (specifically, into the theater) and
given the \"good news.\" They gave us an extra week to decide if we
wanted to stay or go, because instead of everyone who was PQ going, only
roughly one out of every four PQ cadets were going to go to UPT.

You might be surprised to learn that hardly anyone left (I believe it
was around 5-7 cadets who decided to leave on account of this).

What we knew then, and what you should know now, is that *your job in
the Air Force is not the most important result of your Academy career*.
You are an Air Force Officer first, and an AFSC second. The Academy
produces the finest caliber *Air Force Officer* that it can. It doesn\'t
produce the finest *pilot*, or the finest *maintenance officer*, or the
finest *cryptologist*, or the finest *scientist* or *engineer*. Yes,
graduates in those fields are certainly exemplary, but the Academy
produces Air Force Officers of character. Hardly anyone in my class left
the Academy because they knew that they were there to become Air Force
officers, not just pilots. Your job is to be the best officer you can
be, then to be the best \<insert_your_AFSC_here\> you can be.

I hope this gives you a little bit of the information you\'re looking
for. Be sure to read the [[Admissions

story and to track and monitor your admissions path. Everything you need
to get started is there.

Good luck!
