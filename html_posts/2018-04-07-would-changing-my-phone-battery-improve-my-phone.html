**Would changing my phone battery improve my phone\'s performance
(Samsung S6)?**

You quoted an article about the iPhone and you're asking about the S6.

Apple *deliberately* reduced the iPhone's processor's speed in order to
prevent unintended shutdowns caused by batteries which have lost much of
their useful life. They only did this on devices with older batteries. A
battery replacement would reset this feature, and the processor would
run at full speed again.

***Samsung has not done this***.

So if you think that your S6 is slow because Samsung was deliberately
slowing down the processor to prevent unintended shutdowns, and that
getting a new battery will speed up the phone again, this is incorrect.

Your phone is slow because it is not designed to run the operating
system which is running on it. There's a fair chance you're running
Android version 6 or possibly 7, and when that phone was released, it
was released with Android version 5. The hardware just has a difficult
time keeping up with everything you're asking it to do.

About this, there is not much you can do but upgrade your hardware. If
you're a serious techie, you could root the device and install a
different OS (I would suggest
[[LineageOS](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=395593&url=https://lineageos.org/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="lineageos.org"}]{.qlink_container}, which is the
currently-maintained fork of the now discontinued CyanogenMod). The S6
is well past any warranties you may have, so there's no risk in voiding
a warranty by rooting and installing a custom OS.

So you have two really viable choices: root the device and install a new
OS, or upgrade your hardware.
