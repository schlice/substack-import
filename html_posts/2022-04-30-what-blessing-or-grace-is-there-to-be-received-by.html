None whatsoever. We are not baptized in order to gain favor or to become
acceptable to God. We don\'t get baptized *in order to* be saved. We get
baptized *because* we are saved. Baptism is an outward sign of an inner
reality.

We get baptized for a number of reasons. Primarily, we are baptized
because it is commanded by God. Jesus said that if you are a follower,
you show that you are a follower by being baptized.

Secondly, baptism mirrors and celebrates Christ\'s death and
resurrection. Submerging in the water signifies Christ\'s death and
burial. Surfacing from the water signifies Christ\'s resurrection into
eternal life, and the fact that believers will join him in that new
life. This is often echoed by the words that we sometimes say when we
baptize. We'll say, "I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit,"

\<Lower the person into the water\>

"Buried with Christ..."

\<Raise the person out of the water\>

"Raised with him into New Life."

(Note that there is no "script\" to baptism, but this is just one thing
that we say when we baptize someone, and it is right to reprint it here)

You don\'t "get\" anything from baptism. You demonstrate your love for
God by being baptized.
