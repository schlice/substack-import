The purpose of Jesus' death and resurrection wasn't to *eliminate sin*.
Man has a sinful nature; Jesus didn't come to correct that, or to change
the nature of man. Man is still sinful by his very nature.

Jesus came to ***atone for*** that sin. Jesus died and was resurrected
so that our sin no longer separates us from the love of God and eternal
life. Jesus conquered death and gave us the pathway to eternal life.

But we are still sinful, and we can still freely choose to reject the
gift of salvation offered by Jesus' death and resurrection. For love
must be given freely, not coerced, or forced through some abolition of
sin.

Original question:

Why did Jesus die a horrible torturous death for the sin of man for man
to continue sinning ? The Holocaust happened to Jews that devoted their
lives to God. Doesn\'t make sense?
