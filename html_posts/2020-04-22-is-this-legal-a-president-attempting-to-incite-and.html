**Is this legal? A president attempting to incite and form their own
militia?**

100% legal, and protected by the Constitution.

Additionally, there's no evidence that the oddly-named "Army for Trump"
is actually going to be an "army," like with M-16s and battle dress.

I believe the "Army" referred to in the video is more *figurative*,
engaged in the "combat" of "mobilizing" the "troops" who will go vote in
November.

It's kinda a poorly-named "get-out-the-vote" effort. I wouldn't have
called it an "Army," but whatever.
