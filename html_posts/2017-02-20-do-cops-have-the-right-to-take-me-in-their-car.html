Do they have the right to take you to the police station? As part of
fulfilling their duties, indeed they do. They have the right to ask you
to do anything they like. For example, they can ask you to do the
chicken dance on the sidewalk. Or they could ask you to take your hat
off. There are a million things they could ask you to do. But that's not
the question you should be asking.

The question you ***should*** be asking is whether or not you should do
what they ask.

The answer to *that* question is a little more complex. You must
determine whether or not you **must** go with them, or if it's just a
suggestion. That's harder for someone your age to do, especially without
a parent or guardian's assistance.

Let's say you ask them, "Are you detaining me?" or "Are you arresting
me?" If they say that you are not under arrest, you then have to
determine whether or not you feel comfortable going with them, or
whether or not you should just go home and talk to your parents about
it.

The bottom line: **if you are not being detained, you do not have to
stay! You can say "no thank you" and leave. You could also run, although
I would suggest walking.** If it's legal for you to leave, then the
speed at which you leave is irrelevant.

If they are not detaining you, you can ask for a card from the officer
and you can bring it home to your parents. They can then call the police
station and find out why the police thought it would be a good idea to
take a minor for a ride who was not being detained and who was without
parental supervision.
