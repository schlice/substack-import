**If you own a gun, should you ensure your children are trained in gun
usage and safety?**

***YES YES YES YES YES!!!!!!!!!!!***

I cannot emphasize this strongly enough.

And this is more of a *parenting* discussion than it is a *gun*
discussion, because this is true about anything we prohibit our children
from touching. When we do this to our children, it becomes the
"forbidden fruit." The thing which, for some unknown reason, we can't
have.

*And we want it.*

We become *curious* about it.

And in that moment of forgetfulness, when we forget to lock the liquor
cabinet, or we put that handgun in the nightstand instead of the gun
safe, that child will touch it. They'll try a sip of bourbon, or they'll
play with that gun.

**REMOVE THE NOVELTY! DO IT WHILE THEY ARE YOUNG!**

Teach them about firearms, and what they do. Take them to the range.
They probably won't be able to shoot effectively, but the can see what
the gun does.

Most importantly, the whole experience should **teach them that guns are
dangerous, so until they are older, they should not touch them.**

The NRA is one of the world's biggest firearms safety organizations.
They have a youth gun safety program (even a mascot: "Eddie Eagle"). I
had a VHS cassette of their "Learn Gun Safety with Eddie Eagle" video
(narrated by Jason Priestly), and that stupid song sticks in your head:
"Stop, Don't Touch, Leave the Area, Tell an Adult." See if you can find
some educational materials that the NRA puts out to help you teach these
lessons to your kids.

These tenets are incredibly important to teach children, because
*they're not always within view!* Occasionally, they'll go to a friend's
house, or even have a sleepover, and other parents may not be as
cautious as you when it comes to securing firearms.

Teach them early, reinforce often, and stay safe!
