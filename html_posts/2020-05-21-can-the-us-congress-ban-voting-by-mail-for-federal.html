**Can the US Congress ban voting by mail for federal elections?**

No.

The Constitution determines who can do what for elections for Federal
government positions.

In the case of Senators and House Representatives, Article I Section 4
states:

> *The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and
> Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature
> thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such
> Regulations, except as to the Place of Choosing Senators.*

So when it comes to electing Congress, Congress can alter how states
hold those elections. They could pass a new law prohibiting mail-in
ballots for Senators or Representatives.

However, elections of the President are covered separately, in Article
II Section 1:

> *Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof
> may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of
> Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the
> Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an
> Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed
> an Elector.*
>
> *\[...\]*
>
> *The Congress may determine the Time of choosing the Electors, and the
> Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same
> throughout the United States.*

Congress has the authority to choose only the day and time that Electors
are chosen, and that day must be consistent across the country. There is
nothing in there which states that Congress can change the manner by
which a state conducts that election. Therefore, that authority belongs
only to the state.
