\"Likejacking\" is neither illegal nor immoral. It is a
Facebook-specific form of the attack known as \"clickjacking.\"

In \"likejacking,\" users are presented with a web article. The article
is dual-layered. The back layer is designed with a Facebook \"like\"
button which follows your mouse cursor. The front layer is whatever ad
that got you to look in the first place. It doesn\'t matter where on the
ad you click, even if you think you are just clicking through to an
article, you are actually clicking a Facebook \"like\" button, posting
that like to your own wall, and further spreading the spam. Perhaps the
Facebook business you liked was offering a scam promotion, and you
surreptitiously liked it.

This has become a moneymaking scheme through the use of \"affiliate
marketing\" which pays the affiliate for every person who clicks an ad,
or signs up for a service, or whatever else the marketer wants you to
do.

Part of the reason that \"likejacking\" works is that Facebook does not
require any confirmation when you click the \"like\" button.
Confirmation of Facebook \"likes\" might help cut down on
\"likejacking.\"

At worst, \"likejacking\" is a violation of Facebook Terms of Service in
using the \"like\" button, and is enough to get the malicious ad poster
kicked off of Facebook, but that\'s about it, It\'s not illegal, and
it\'s not immoral.
