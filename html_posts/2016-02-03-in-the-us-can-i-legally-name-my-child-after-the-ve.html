In the US, you can name your child anything you choose. Vulgarity and
public decency standards do apply, but other than that, you can name
your child whatever you choose.

However, I might submit to you the following:

It\'s not necessarily whether or not you ***can***, it\'s whether or not
you ***should.***

Do you remember the song, \"A Boy Named Sue\"? I would request that you
look up the song, or at least look up the lyrics. You\'ll have to
understand what sort of psychological trauma you might be inflicting you
your child by your choice of name.
