*(Note that this question and answer were written April 6, 2022, which
was when Musk was only the largest shareholder of Twitter. not the
company's owner)*

Wow, there's a lot to unpack here. Let's start with Elon Musk and
Twitter:

1.  Musk does not own a "controlling share of Twitter." He is their
    largest single shareholder, holding just over 9% of Twitter shares.
    A "controlling interest" would be greater than 50% of Twitter
    shares, and then he'd "own" Twitter. He'd have the controlling vote,
    and could basically control the direction of the company.
2.  Musk has not stated any intention to make modifications to the
    company. He disclosed his purchase on a SEC form 13G, which means
    it's a *passive interest*. If he wanted to take an *active interest*
    (which he still can), he would have to file a SEC form 13D, which he
    could do in the future.
3.  Probably in a move to keep Musk in an appropriately-sized box and
    control him a little bit, Twitter decided it would be in their best
    interest to *place him on the Board of Directors*. But in doing so,
    they stated that he can't own more than 14.9% of Twitter shares,
    either individually or as part of a group, while he's on the Board.
4.  He can absolutely agitate for change, but he can't *demand* change.
    That said, he now has a material ownership in the company, and he
    won't push for radical changes, so long as they listen to his ideas
    and execute on them. The point that Twitter execs should be wary of
    is that *he can*.

Now, let's talk about "everyone else." **No private web service needs to
stop censoring any views at all**. There is no requirement for any
private company to provide any sort of platform which holds to any of
the free speech principles in the Bill of Rights. The Bill of Rights
binds the *government* from creating laws which violate rights.
Companies can have whatever speech policies in place they like. However,
if they do censor some views, they are not free, open online platforms,
and they should not claim to be. Claiming to be a free, open platform
while actively censoring opposing views of any kind is disingenuous at
best, and antithetical to free speech at worst. The various web services
have been doing so in the name of "online safety," but the line between
safety and censorship is not legally well defined. This will come to a
head at some point.

YouTube, Facebook and others have to stop censoring opposing view
