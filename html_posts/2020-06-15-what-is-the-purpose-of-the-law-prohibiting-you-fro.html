**What is the purpose of the law prohibiting you from placing traps on
your property or tampering with your food to catch a thief? Are there
any morally wrong scenarios that it prevents?**

Setting traps which can harm someone in order to catch lawbreakers is
immoral because the traps are indiscriminate. They can harm a lawbreaker
exactly the same way they can harm a paramedic responding to a call for
service. They can harm a trespasser in exactly the same way that they
harm a child retrieving a lost ball. The food trap can harm your lunch
thief in exactly the same way as it harms the foreigner who doesn't
understand that the fridge in the break room is not community property.

On the legal side (not the moral side), bodily harm is not the
punishment for breaking the laws in question. You can't be sentenced to
be caught in a trap for breaking a boundary rule. You can't be sentenced
to hospitalization for a petty theft. Punishments are determined by a
court, not by an alleged victim.
