The two parts of the question are incongruous.

**What are some examples of an unlawful order from a police officer?**

My esteemed colleagues have already provided information about what is a
lawful and unlawful order, I don\'t think I need to re-hash it.

**Or do the police have the right to make you do what they want?**

The two parts of your question are not related. If the order is lawful,
it\'s likely that he wants you to obey it.

It sounds like you\'re asking if the police have the right to tell you
to do anything that they please at any time, and you simply have to
follow it because it\'s an order from a police officer.

So if a police officer said to you \"strip naked right here right now,\"
do you think that order would be enforceable? If you had just been
exposed to a deadly neurotoxin that was seeping through your clothes and
if it made contact with your skin it would instantly kill you, it\'s
possible that such an order would be lawful. But an officer doesn\'t
have to tell you at that moment what the source for his order is. So how
are you to know? You might ask, \"Why, was I exposed to a deadly
neurotoxin that is now seeping its way through my clothes and if it
touches my ski\.....\" and then you die because you took too long trying
to figure out why a police officer would order you to do such a thing.

If you do follow an order and it causes you to do something that makes
you uncomfortable or you think that might be unlawful, make sure to
follow up with the officer\'s chain of command by filing a police
report, or retaining an attorney to assist you in filing charges against
the department.

Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a
civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not
misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously. My mental well-being
isn\'t worth your harassing, inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I
wrote, tough shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is
un-cited opinion masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m
wrong, write your own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site,
not a debate site. If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually,
you\'re wrong,\" don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment.
Put anything vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be
followed by a block and a mute. I will do this immediately and with no
compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*
