**Content:** [There are lots of answers here, but none actually
addressed Quora\'s TOS.\
\
In general, people who answer legal or medical questions are called
\"intended third-party benificiaries.\"\
\
Let me start with what Quora\'s TOS says about answers given to legal
and medical questions. I know it\'s a lot, but it\'s important, and I
added some ***emphasis***:\

\
So in general, people who use Quora are bound by the terms of service on
the site, which state very clearly that not only is Quora not to be held
liable for any answers, but the answerers of said questions are also not
to be held liable. When you create and use an account, you agree to this
contract.\
\
Also, under the legal question section, it says very clearly that
content is provided for **informational use only**, and no action should
be taken based on the content. If someone chooses to take action based
on this content, they really lack the legal basis to come back and sue
based on simply what they read on a website where the TOS says very
clearly that you must not take any action based on this information.\
\
So this covers you in general. However, knowing that laws vary by state,
if a lawyer is licensed in a particular state and they require certain
disclaimers on any of their academic works, Quora gives them the ability
to add a tag on the bottom of each legal post they make that they can
modify to meet their state standards. In general, though, most
medical/legal question answerers leave their disclaimers to match the
boilerplate version Quora provides. Unless your state requires it, the
tag on the message is not necessary, since the TOS covers you in
general. However, if you have a specific state requirement for specific
wording for any of your academic works, the tag system allows you to add
that. It\'s always best, however, to drive that point home every time
(both in the TOS and the answer itself) that the answer is not specific
legal advice, and you should always consult your own lawyer with
specific legal questions.
