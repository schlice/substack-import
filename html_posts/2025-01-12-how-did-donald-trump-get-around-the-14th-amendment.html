So the other answerers were correct, but let's go into a little more
detail about the 14th Amendment.

The 14th Amendment was part of a series of Constitutional amendments
passed following the end of the Civil War known as the *Reconstruction
Amendments*. They included the 13th Amendment, which ended slavery, the
14th Amendment, which provided equal protection under the law, granted
citizenship to everyone born here, and prevented any of the previous
cessation state politicians from holding positions in the new
government, and the 15th Amendment which allowed the freed slaves to
vote by preventing discrimination in voting based on skin color or
previous condition of servitude.

At the time of Reconstruction, the 14th Amendment prevented several
former Confederates from being sworn in to the post-Civil War Congress,
including a county sheriff, U.S. congressmen, and even a local
postmaster. At that time, there was a general understanding that the
disqualification clause barred ex-Confederates. So, many more former
officials didn\'t attempt to run for office again during this period.
Clause 5 of the Amendment permits Congress to enforce the Amendment
through "appropriate legislation."

Congress passed that legislation which also criminalized "insurrection."
This law is codified in 18 U.S. Code ยง 2383. A conviction under this
statute will lead to being ineligible from federal office. This could
form the basis for a future Supreme Court ruling that a person *not*
convicted of the crime of "insurrection" cannot be disqualified under
Section 3. However, the Supreme Court has not yet decided on such an
issue, nor has one been brought before the High Court.

Finally, in 1872, Congress passed the Amnesty Act. This removed Section
3 disqualification for most former Confederate officials (except
high-profile leaders like Jefferson Davis).

Today, the 14th Amendment gets tossed around a lot, with some people
questioning why Clause 3 (the Disqualification Clause) was not
implemented in the case of President Trump. There are several
significant reasons.

First, most of what we talk about regarding Clause 3 is *theoretical*.
Courts have had very little opportunity to ever develop any case law
around it, so it has never been thoroughly vetted by the courts.

Second, Clause 3 is *political*, not *legal*. So much like impeachment
being for "high crimes and misdemeanors" taking place during an elected
official's term, disqualification is something that Congress determines
(see *Trump v. Anderson 23--719 2024)*. Clause 5 says that it is
Congress who carries out the disqualification, and since the Clause does
not specify an amount, precedent says that only a simple majority of
both Houses of Congress would be needed, if a criminal conviction of
insurrection has not taken place, to disqualify someone from office.

To date, Congress has not moved to disqualify President Trump on the
basis of a 14th Amendment violation.

So no, Trump did not "get around" the 14th Amendment; he didn't meet the
criteria to be disqualified under it. Congress did not act to disqualify
him, and so he is not disqualified.
