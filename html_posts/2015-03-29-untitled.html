<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [I\'m not pinning anything on anyone. I\'m telling you case
law states this very principle. And since it\'s been upheld for hundreds
of years (the principle was first seen in court in 1855), it\'s not very
thin at all.\
\
I\'ll give you just a few examples, though there are many:\
\
-In *Daubenspeck, et al. v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,* the court
ruled that state troopers had no special relationship with, and thus
owed no duty to, automobile accident victims who were injured at an icy
roadway on an interstate highway, even though the troopers allegedly
knew of the hazard and failed to control or direct traffic around the
icy spot and failed to reduce the risk and danger to traveling
motorists. The court held that "\[i\]n general, the police have a common
law duty to protect the public when carrying out their duties, and the
failure to act generally is not considered a harm to an individual.\"\
\
- In *Kromer v. County of Onondaga*, the father of a woman who was
murdered by her estranged husband sued the police for failing to protect
her. As the executor of her estate, he alleged that defendant county
police officers acted recklessly and negligently in failing to protect
his daughter after she had reported that, two weeks before the murder,
her husband assaulted and raped her. On appeal, the court affirmed the
trial order granting defendants' motion for summary judgment dismissing
the complaint. The court ruled that the plaintiff failed to produce
evidence showing that there was a special relationship between the
daughter and the police that is necessary to impose liability.\
\
The police officer defendants established that the decedent did not
contact them during the two-week period between the alleged assault/rape
and the murder, and thus the plaintiff could not produce evidence to
show whether any acts of the defendants lulled her "into a false sense
of security, induced \[her\] to either relax \[her\] own vigilance or
forego other viable avenues of protection, and thereby placed
\[decedent\] in a worse position than \[she\] would have been in had
defendants never assumed the underlying duty."\
\
- In *Schoenfield v. Navarre*, Wendy Schoenfield sued the City of
Toledo's police chief and eight police officers, alleging that they were
negligent in failing to prevent her husband's suicide. The owner of a
firearms store had called the police after Eric Schoenfield attempted to
purchase a gun because he was acting strangely during his interactions
with the salesperson. The police questioned Schoenfield, who was calm
and denied that he had any suicidal intentions. Nevertheless, the police
detained Schoenfield when his wife expressed her concerns that her
husband might commit suicide, but he was released before she arrived to
pick him up. Eric Schoenfield checked into a motel, purchased a gun from
K-Mart, and shot himself. Wendy Schoenfield sued the police, claiming
that because they failed to keep her husband in custody, they had
breached a duty to protect him and thus had caused his death. The state
court determined that "any common law duty imposed upon employees of a
political subdivision" must be evaluated under the state statute
governing sovereign immunity. The court ruled that the police were
immune from suit because there was no evidence that they "failed to act
appropriately under the circumstances\[\...\]or that they intentionally
violated any known duty" to Mr. Schoenfield.\

\
These lawsuits are generally unsuccessful because there is a general
duty to the public, not a specific duty to the individual. Unless there
was some special relationship (i.e. custodial) or the officers created a
harmful situation, the public duty doctrine stands.]{.rendered_qtext}
