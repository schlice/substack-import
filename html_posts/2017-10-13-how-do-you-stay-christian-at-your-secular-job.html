It's actually very, very easy. The tenets of Christianity actually make
it so.

We are directed to \"\'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and
with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind\';
and, \'Love your neighbor as yourself.\'\" (Luke 10:27).

We love our neighbors. That doesn't mean liking them unless they believe
as you do. That means loving them **as they are**, faults and all.

You feel sorry for them sometimes, but you love them just the same. And
you *show them* through your own actions how to live as a Christian.
Show them compassion. Show them respect. Show them mercy.

We were provided with the penultimate example of a good life in Jesus
Christ. We'll never meet that standard, but that's the gold standard for
how to live. Living your life in this way is a far better example of
your faith than proselytizing.

I want people to ask me, "How can you be so upbeat all the time, with
all the misery around us?" Because I can show them a better, happier way
to live.
