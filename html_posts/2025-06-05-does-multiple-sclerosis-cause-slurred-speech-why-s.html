It can. MS can interfere with the muscles in your mouth and throat, and
that interference is most commonly seen in swallowing issues. However,
it can also interfere with your mouth and tongue, which could result in
slurred speech.

But as with anything, having slurred speech is not a sign of MS. It's a
sign of *a host of conditions, one of which could be MS*. If slurred
speech is the only symptom, the root cause of that symptom would have to
be found. It could be MS, but it could be a host of other diseases or
conditions too.
