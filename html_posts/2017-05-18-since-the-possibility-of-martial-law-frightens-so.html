First of all, it's a fear, not a possibility. Secondly, it's borne of a
misunderstanding of what martial law is in the United States, which in
short means that martial law and overriding the 22nd Amendment to the
Constitution are completely unrelated.

Martial law involves the suspension of *habeas corpus*, which is
basically being arrested and held without a hearing. More broadly, it is
the oversight of law enforcement by the judicial branch. Article 1,
Section 9 states, \"The Privilege of the Writ of *Habeas Corpus* shall
not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the
public Safety may require it.\"

In these cases, the military takes over specific duties as appointed by
the president, to keep order or to preserve or maintain peace (the Posse
Comitatus Act covers this as well). Since the military would be in
charge, and is required to follow the Constitution (*sans* habeas
corpus), the military would *strongly encourage* the President to uphold
the 22nd Amendment.

However, just because habeas corpus is suspended doesn't mean the rest
of the Constitution is. There is still the First and Second Amendments
to deal with...

So in short, no president is going to extend his or her term until the
22nd Amendment is repealed. This means you would need widespread
national support to do so, and no president will engender such support.
