As with most answers about HOAs, this one too is the same: the answer is
in the Governing Documents. Do note that an HOA is a 501(c)(4)
non-profit corporation, and as such, it has adopted Governing Documents
which dictate how the Corporation part of the association is governed.

In the Governing Documents will be the rules for who may qualify as an
elected Board member.

In the case of most Boards of Directors, a member must not be delinquent
for more than anywhere from 30 to 90 days in order to qualify to run for
the Board.

But your mileage may vary; consult your Governing Documents to find the
exact requirements to run for the Board.
