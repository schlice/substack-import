**Will the Mueller Report be enough to overcome the elephant in the room
AKA \"The good of the country\" and finally flush Trump out of office?**

Most certainly not.

Even if the House Democrats look at Mueller's report and determine that
there is enough evidence in the "emanations and penumbras" (because it's
not in the written text) that Trump attempted to obstruct justice, and
they decide to impeach him over it, the Senate will never vote to remove
him from office. It wlll be seen as blatantly political, it will serve
to destroy the integrity of the impeachment process (reducing it to
"sour grapes" political caterwauling) and it will cost them the White
House in 2020 when Trump gets re-elected.

The only point at which Trump is going to leave office is at the natural
conclusion of his term. Based on how Democrats in Congress are handling
Mueller's findings, that looks like it will be in 2024.
