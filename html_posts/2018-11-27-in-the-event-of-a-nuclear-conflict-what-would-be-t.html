**In the event of a nuclear conflict, what would be the instructions for
the Air Force One, if it was known that major bases were taken out?**

First of all, missile flight time is not instantaneous. It would take
about 30 minutes for a missile to go airborne and then to impact within
the United States. So we do have a few minutes to react.

In the event of missile launch threatening the United States, the
President would go airborne from wherever he is. If he is at the White
House, he, the First Family, and key staffers from the White House would
be evacuated by helicopter to Joint Base Andrews. From there, they would
board Air Force One and would take off. Where and when they land would
be entirely up to them.

The rest of the cabinet and those in the line of succession would be
evacuated to [[Site
R](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=246c1a&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven_Rock_Mountain_Complex){.external_link

September 11th, 2001, the President went airborne, and the Vice
President went to Site R.

NORAD staff would relocate from Peterson Air Force Base up the road into
the Cheyenne Mountain Complex.
