**Content:** [It is illegal to possess a firearm that fires more than
one round per trigger pull without a Federal Firearms License.\
\
It\'s not illegal, in most places, to sell parts that allow you to
create such a weapon.\
\
Some may argue that the devices actually are separate trigger pulls, so
they keep with the letter of the law.\
\
Sure, you go ahead and hang on to that. It can be your defense in
court.\
\
But what about the spirit, the intent of the law?]{.rendered_qtext}
