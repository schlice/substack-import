**How successful is President Trump\'s Tax Cut bill given that most
companies are spending more in buying back stocks than in investing in
capital or labor?**

I'm not sure you and I define *success* in the same way.

The tax plan has arguably put money back in the pockets of every
working-class American in this country. By lowering the Federal income
tax, companies withhold less from your paycheck, which means more money
in your pocket.

This also means more money for companies to use (since their effective
tax rates are higher than the individual worker). They can do lots of
things with that money, including returning some of it directly to
employees in the form of bonuses or pay increases, capital investments,
R&D investments, business expansion, or simply strengthening the bottom
line of the business by reducing debt by buying back stocks.

The simple fact is that money is *moving*. Under the Obama-era economic
uncertainty, businesses didn't invest. They just held on to their
capital reserves. They knew they had improvements to make, but with such
a volatile and uncertain market, no one wanted to spend the money.

The market loves certainty. And under Trump's tax bill. it is certain
that the economy will grow. And when companies see positive movement in
the economy, they loosen the reins on their capital reserves, and they
start spending. The more companies spend, the better the health of the
economy.

**TL;DR: Stipulating that companies must spend on labor or capital
improvements is too narrow a measurement to determine whether or not the
tax plan is successful.**
