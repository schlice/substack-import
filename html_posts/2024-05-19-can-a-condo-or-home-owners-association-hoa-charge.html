The answer, as with all specific behaviors by any one HOA, can only be
determined by reviewing the Governing Documents of that Association.
Some HOAs may have the authority to issue some fines without notifying
anyone of a violation.

However, in most cases, I believe this to be highly unlikely. In most
cases, the HOA gives the resident *multiple, varied* opportunities to
remedy the violating condition. They do this primarily through letters
and emails, but the Governing Documents can specify other approved
methods of contact.

It is generally only after a few warnings (and an opportunity to address
the Board personally at a Board meeting) that a fine will be issued.
Some fining processes are so involved and convoluted (I'm looking at
you, Florida) that it's very, very difficult to get any sort of fine
added to any homeowner's ledger sheet at all. This, of course, is done
in the name of protecting homeowners from out-of-control Boards. But the
opposite effect happens too: it's nearly impossible for the Board to
actually issue any fines because the process is so onerous.
