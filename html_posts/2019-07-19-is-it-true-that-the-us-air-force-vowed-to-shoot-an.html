**Is it true that the US Air Force vowed to shoot anyone who storms Area
51?**

**TL;DR: No one will even get close to entering the actual facility.**

Area 51 is a military facility adjacent to Groom Lake in southern
Nevada.

This is a sign from the outer border of Area 51. The little inset sign
on the big one has little red words on the bottom which read: "Use of
deadly force is authorized." It's true. I used to work at another
Priority 1 non-nuclear facility: NORAD. We had the same signs. I carried
the guns.

The difference at Area 51 is that the actual facility is surrounded by
thousands of acres of desert terrain, which is all owned by the
government. Anyone even hanging around the outer border not in a common
public area will incur a visit by the local sheriff. Anyone entering the
outer border will be arrested. Those orange posts in the picture
indicate the outer border of the government facility.

But what about the base, you say? The closest you can get to the base on
public land is Tikaboo Peak, which is still 26 miles (41.8 km) from the
facility. You'll have a long way to Naruto run before you even make it
to the fence. Same distance as a marathon, basically, but through the
desert.
