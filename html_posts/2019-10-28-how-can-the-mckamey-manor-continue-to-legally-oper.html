**How can the McKamey Manor continue to legally operate even though it
openly admits to torturing its guests?**

There are a few reasons that McKamey Manor is legal to operate.

1.  The experience does not fall under local zoning ordinances because
    it is not legally considered a business. Participants pay nothing to
    go through the up to 36 hour ordeal. At times, the owner has
    requested donations of dog food for his pets and donations to local
    animal shelters in the area. All of the employees are volunteers
2.  The owner, Russ McKamey, said he spends four hours with a potential
    participant, walking them through a 40-page waiver. He also said he
    requires a letter from a physician, a criminal background check,
    pre-event interviews and does a portable drug test the day of the
    event.

In his Tennessee location, the fact that he is not a business, and that
guests are voluntary participants, makes the entire "simulated torture"
thing legal.

He didn't previously have a safe word option, but because of some legal
trouble in San Diego, he now has implemented a safe word option that
allows a participant to stop the experience at any time. This only
contributes to the fact that the experience is completely voluntary and
can be terminated at any time, making the experience even more legally
protected.

McKamey says that it is very safe and that all of the experiences are
simulated. He has never been arrested for torturing anyone. He maintains
a safety crew that remains within a foot of the participants to ensure
their safety.
