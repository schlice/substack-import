The truth is the truth, regardless of how unpopular or horrible it may
be.

The appeal of a doctrine does not determine the truthfulness of that
doctrine.

Annihilationism and Universalism aren't more popular because they are
based on misunderstandings of Biblical doctrine. As people learn the
truth about the Bible, the truth about God and the truth about our
eternal destinies, these false and unbiblical belief systems fall by the
wayside, only being supported by those who are either ignorant, or
willfully deceptive.

Their alleged increased rationality is also due to the same
misinterpretation of the Bible.
