Yes. If you believe in things that can't be substantiated by evidence,
or if you believe in things that conflict with reason, you believe in
fairy tales. It may not be an illness per se, but it certainly is not a
substantiated belief.

Religion is no different. Believing in something with no evidence
doesn't really seem like a very valid belief, right?

Absolutely right.

But religion in general is not always believing in things that can't be
substantiated by evidence. Belief that God exists can absolutely be
substantiated by evidence and is perfectly reasonable, so it would
certainly not be mental illness to believe it.
