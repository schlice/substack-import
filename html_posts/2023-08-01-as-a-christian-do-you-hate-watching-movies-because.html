Not exactly.

As a Christian, I hate watching movies because the values of the people
who are portrayed in the movie are *so different from me.*

I see how they live, and I know that they live by the desires of their
flesh. They love their lives. They love the life they live, and the
Bible talks about this.

You often hear the kitchy phrase, "Love the sinner, hate the sin."
That's not directly out of the Bible, but it is referenced in a
roundabout way. We hate sin by recognizing it for what it is, refusing
to take part in it, and condemning it as contrary to God's nature. Sin
is to be hated, not excused or taken lightly. We love sinners by showing
them respect (1 Peter 2:17), praying for them (1 Timothy 2:1), and
witnessing to them of Christ.

It is a true act of love to treat someone with respect and kindness even
though you do not approve of his or her lifestyle or sinful choices, and
this is something that Christians have great difficulty with. It is not
loving to allow a person to remain stuck in sin. It is not hateful to
tell a person he or she is in sin. In fact, the exact opposites are
true. Sin leads to death (James 1:15), and we love the sinner by
speaking the truth in love (Ephesians 4:15). We hate the sin by refusing
to condone, ignore, or excuse it.

So if I'm itching to live that life that I see on the screen, then I
wish to live in sin. If I desire to live in sin, I am not saved. I'd
have some serious work to do before I'd be comfortable calling myself
Christian.

So if you call yourself Christian and you find yourself envious of the
people you see around you, you also have some work to do, as we all do,
as we are indeed all sinners. We need to recognize the fact that we are
living in sin and only faith in Christ can save us.
