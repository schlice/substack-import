**Content:** [*Original question:* ***How do we in the USA hope to stop
terrorist organizations like ISIS when we can\'t even stop the mass
shootings by single SOB\'s with automatic weapons, such as happend in
Oregon today. When is it going to stop?***\
\
*First, let me clarify a few things. It appears that there was only one
shooter. We also know that he had \"three pistols and one rifle\" and
none of these appear to be automatic.*\
\
This is an example of an invalid logical comparison, or in more
colloquial terms, an \"apples to oranges\" comparison.\
\
ISIS is an international terrorist organization with ties to radical
Islam. ISIS is being handled by military and political action. As you
know, the military operates outside of the United States. Despite any
desire to the contrary, we can\'t just fly over Iran and Syria and nuke
them into sheets of glass, the only sure way to stop ISIS. We have to
proceed cautiously and diplomatically, and with the aid of international
allies (lest we be perceived as the \"lone wolf\" again). The ISIS issue
will take some time to sort out, and yes, more lives will be lost before
we come up with a cogent strategy to deal with them.\
\
Conversely, and as has been well documented on Quora, the majority of
active shooter incidents within the borders of the United States occur
because of mental illness and/or perceived injustices. We have a dismal
record of helping people with mental illness. We do a better job of
stigmatizing and marginalizing these people than actually helping them.
Deinstitutionalization did more to harm them than to help them, as the
people who truly need help find it harder and harder to get inpatient
care. We have stigmatized mental illness to such a degree that people
who do believe they need help won\'t get it because they know they will
become social outcasts, treated no better than felons.\
\
So with nowhere to turn for treatment, feeling more and more isolated,
they slip further and further into illness, until they truly believe
they can fix their social issues and any perceived injustices by taking
the lives of others. Once they do, they feel \"free,\" as if they have
been avenged, and usually take their own lives. *I suspect the shooter
here took his own life as well, but we don\'t know this with any
certainty at this point.*\
\
When is it going to stop? When we do a better job of treating the
severely mentally ill in this country. Ignoring the problem and saying
that a few simple drugs can handle mental illness does a great
disservice to the severely mentally ill. And shootings like this one
will continue until we address the issue.]{.rendered_qtext}
