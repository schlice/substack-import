**Content:** [Are you asking if it\'s time for the US Government to turn
socialist, and break into the homes of every American and forcefully
disarm them, thus making them slaves to the New Amerika? You\'d have to
get rid of the Second, Forth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments, so in
essence, you\'d be throwing the whole Constitution out and starting
over.\
\
You\'ll then abolish all \"states.\" That whole \"state\" thing was so
200 years ago. Who needs them? The One Government will tell you what to
think, how to act, and what to feel. Don\'t need pesky state governments
getting in the way anymore.\
\
If that\'s not your plan, then until you can repeal the Second
Amendment, you can\'t pass a law that would make guns illegal in
America.]{.rendered_qtext}
