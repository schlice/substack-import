**Will the Supreme Court declare all United States presidents are above
the law until the end of their presidency?**

No.

"Above the law" implies that the person is *not subject to the law*, and
that is simply not the case. It is instead most likely the case that the
President is *ineligible for prosecution while sitting in the office of
the President.* Once the President no longer occupies the office (either
because he was removed by impeachment or completes his natural term), he
is once again subject to prosecution.

It is also highly likely that the statute of limitations on any charges
which are filed would be *tolled* until the President becomes eligible
for prosecution. We say that it's "most likely" or "highly likely"
because that makes legal sense, but it has never been tested before, so
we don't know.

Therefore, if there is anything that the Supreme Court could decide
which would even speak to your question, that would be it.
