The two states that don't actually require insurance from an insurance
company do require other things. For example, in New Hampshire, where
auto insurance is not required, you have to show that you are able to
pay for damages in the event of an accident. In Virginia, the only other
state which does not require you to have auto insurance, you can pay an
"uninsured motorist fee" annually, but you remain personally liable in
the event of an accident
