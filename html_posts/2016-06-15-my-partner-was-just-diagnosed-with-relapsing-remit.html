If she was just diagnosed, she will be beginning her journey through the
5 stages of grief: denial, anger, depression, bargaining, and
acceptance. Remember, everyone grieves in their own way. Not everyone
experiences all five stages, and not everyone experiences them in the
same order. Grieving is a personal process. There is no time limit.
There is no "right" way to grieve.

**Denial** **** is only temporary. We do it to protect ourselves from
that first big wave of pain caused from the realization that your life
will never be the same, your life will never work out the way you
originally thought or dreamed it would, and that you have an incurable
disease that will cause you grief and become a new and totally unwanted
facet of your daily life, but could also land you in a wheelchair (or
worse) when you're older. Denial may only last a few days, and along
with bargaining, may be one of the quickest phases to go through.

**Anger** is what happens when the denial wears off. The reality of the
situation hits us, and we're wholly unprepared to deal with it. We
deflect the pain away from ourselves, and it is manifested as anger. The
anger is caused by the helplessness and the vulnerability we feel when
we learn we have MS. Be aware, *you* may be the target of that anger.
Please, please know it is not personal. She is not attacking you. She is
releasing her pain because she is protecting herself from it.

When we find that medications may slow down the disease progression, but
nothing will ever cure us of the disease, **depression** sets in. Almost
everyone with MS has experienced some level of depression throughout the
course of the disease. Some research claimed that injectable therapy
carried a risk of depression, but I truly believe that the association
is anecdotal. I believe that in the course of progressing through the
grieving process, we come to the inevitable realization that *we will
have MS until the day we die, and potentially, MS could make that happen
sooner.* There is simply no way that depression would not follow that
realization. Sometimes, depression is caused by fear of the unknown, or
fear of the practical complications of the disease. "Will I be able to
walk my daughter down the aisle?" "Will I be able to throw a baseball
with my son ever again?" (That one was mine, since my first symptom was
optic neuritis, and suffice it to say that for six months anything
moving toward or away from me at any reasonable speed gave me double
vision. I couldn't catch a baseball). I actually started letters to my
children titled "Read this in case of my untimely death" but I couldn't
get through them because the grief was so strong, and the tears fell so
freely.

There is a second type of depression that more often occurs with
terminal diseases (of which MS is not), but still occurs with MS with
some regularity, and that is the realization of our mortality and the
preparation for death. We silently and subconsciously push others away
from us to insulate them from our pain. We protect them because we love
them and we don't want to see them hurt. My wife would say things like,
"Are you deliberately trying to push me away?" I wasn't *deliberately*
doing it, I was *subconsciously* doing it. Don't feel bad if you start
to feel that your partner is pushing you away. She doesn't know she's
doing it. Perhaps she just needs a hug. Perhaps she just needs to know
that despite her pain, you're not going away.

**Bargaining** follows the helplessness and vulnerability, as we seek a
way to control the uncontrollable. Lots of "if only" statements are
made. "If only we hadn't gone to Bermuda and gotten those horrible
sunburns, I wouldn't have skin cancer now." "If only I would have found
out sooner, I could have gotten ahead of this." In the case of MS, "If
only my vitamin D levels were straightened out before I turned 15, I may
have prevented this" (fwiw, the prophylactic effects of vitamin D in
early childhood are still being investigated). Deals with God often
happen during this phase, but are just another line of defense against
the pain.

While bargaining or making deals, what we are actually doing is
*experimenting* with strategies to cope with the disease. "Maybe I can
exercise more, to make myself healthier and potentially stave off some
of the muscle effects caused by the disease." This
bargaining/experimenting phase is what starts lifting us out of
depression. Be supportive of your partner during this phase. She may
have some crazy-sounding ideas, but she's toying with the ways to cope
with the disease, and starting into the next stage:

**Acceptance.** This is the point we reach when we realize that we
*have* MS, we *are not* MS. We are not our disease. With proper disease
management, we can live as full and active a life as someone without the
disease. With modern medicine, mortality rates among MS patients nearly
match those of people without the disease. And no one can ever predict
the sudden turns the disease may take, but they are no more or less
sudden and unexpected in their onset than being involved in a car
accident. Worrying about them will not make the disease progress more
slowly, so worry is a wasted emotion. For me, one of my great tools of
acceptance is Quora (and other Q&A and medical community sites). I get
to help others who are recently diagnosed, or who are struggling to come
to grips with a disease that is eminently beyond understanding or
prediction. Being a patient advocate means I know what it's like to be a
patient, because I am one (I'm not only the Hair Club president, but I'm
also a client) (If you don't know that one, look it up. I may have just
shown my age).

Make sure you give your partner space to grieve, but not so much space
that she feels like you're pulling away from her because she has a
disease. Be there for her, but don't smother her. She needs reassurance
that you're not going away, but she needs time alone to work through her
grief.

*Keep being her best friend*. Don't let MS change that. Ever.
