**Content:** [When you decide that living your life medicine-free is
worth the relapses.\
\
On average, without medicine, the disease progresses from RRMS
(Relapsing Remitting MS to Secondary Progressive MS) in 10 years.
Progressive forms of the disease (except for Progressive Relapsing MS)
show continuous worsening of symptoms with little sign of relapse or
remission.\
\
So if you figure that assuming you have 10 years before your disease
changes to SPMS (unless you were diagnosed at age 60, you likely have
fewer, but we\'ll use 10 as the high baseline), you have to be willing
to say that at age 70, you can live with progressive MS. If your legs
get weak enough, you may be wheelchair-bound a short time after that.
Hopefully, you won\'t be bedridden while you are still cogent enough to
care.\
\
Is that a risk you are willing to take, knowing that, in actuality, you
probably have less time than that before you turn progressive? The
decision is yours to make, but I would consider the timeframes carefully
before making it.]{.rendered_qtext}
