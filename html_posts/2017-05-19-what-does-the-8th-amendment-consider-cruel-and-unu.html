This is why you've seen a switch away from the electric chair, the
hangman's noose, the guillotine and the firing squad to more "humane"
execution methods. As each is found to cause pain, it too is reviewed
and changed.

We thought the gas chamber was a good way to execute people without
undue suffering, and it certainly was better than the electric chair and
the firing squad, but it was determined to cause pain, and so has
generally been outlawed as a method of execution.

We thought we had the problem of "pain during execution" licked when
they came up with lethal injection. Inject a solution to cause
unconsciousness, inject a paralytic, and then inject a chemical to stop
the heart. Simple, painless, and effective. Right? Well, not so much.
The idea behind the three drugs was to mimic the chemical cocktail used
during surgery. Except that an anesthesiologist is required to
administer the drugs during surgery; no such person is present during a
lethal injection. If the chemicals are not accurately dosed for the
person being executed, it is possible that, for example, the pancuronium
bromide used to paralyze the muscles may not work, or the dose of sodium
thiopental may be too low (for example, in the case of an opioid addict)
and the subsequent injection of potassium chloride would cause
tremendous pain while the person is undergoing cardiac arrest.

There is now a movement because of at least one highly-publicized failed
lethal injection, to change the drugs. Eleven states have switched, or
have stated their intention to switch, to a one-drug lethal injection
protocol. A one-drug method is using the single drug sodium thiopental
to execute someone. The drug, by itself, is lethal at high doses, in
just the same way that opiate addicts can kill themselves by overdosing
on heroin, for example. In theory, it should be entirely painless, as
the person universally loses consciousness before death. However, the
new improved one-drug execution method hit yet another snag. In 2011,
after pressure by activist organizations, the manufacturers of sodium
thiopental and pentobarbital halted supply of the drugs to U.S. prisons
performing lethal injections and required all resellers to do the same.

Now, facing a shortage of the one drug that could perform the most
humane lethal injections, prisons and legislatures scrambled to find a
better, more sustainable solution. It was suggested that inert gas
asphyxiation could be used to execute prisoners. Indeed, people
worldwide have been using nitrogen asphyxiation as a method to commit
suicide, and assisted suicide. It is painless, as the body does not feel
like it is choking due to lack of air, even though the oxygen content in
the "air" is eliminated. The person has no feeling that they are
suffocating, and loses consciousness in one to two breaths. Persons
committing assisted suicide will often use a plastic gas-enclosing bag
placed over the head, commonly known as a "suicide bag." The hazards of
inert gas asphyxiation are well known, and in the US alone, at least 80
people died due to nitrogen gas asphyxiation between 1992 and 2002. In
April 2015, the governor of Oklahoma signed a bill authorizing nitrogen
asphyxiation as an alternative execution method if the state's preferred
execution method was not available. No one has yet been executed using
this method.
