**What does a Visual Evoked Potential (VEP) test do?**

Excellent question! Thanks for asking.

A VEP test, on its own, is not an incredibly useful test. However, when
used as part of the body of evidence used in determining whether or not
a person has Multiple Sclerosis (MS), it can be a very helpful addition.

When your eyes see an image, that image is converted into electrical
signals which travel down a series of nerves and are interpreted by the
brain. The VEP test measures those electrical signals in the brain, and
can show nerve issues which would otherwise be too subtle to detect
using other tests.

To perform the test, electrodes will be attached to your scalp, and you
will watch a series of checkerboard patterns appear on a screen. The
electrical signals delivered to the area of your brain that processes
visual signals will be measured, and the differences between your eyes,
the sides of your brain, and differences between "standard" responses
will be measured. The test is completely painless and takes about 20--30
minutes to run.
