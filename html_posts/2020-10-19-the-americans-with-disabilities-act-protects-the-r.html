**The Americans with Disabilities Act protects the right for all people
to have access to all places of public accommodation whether publicly or
privately owned. Wouldn\'t an Order of Protection deprive a person of
the right to use public accommodation?**

The Americans with Disabilities Act does not protect the right for all
people to access all places of public accommodation. It simply states
that people with disabilities must have *equal access* to all places of
public accommodation as those without disabilities. It does not bestow
any special rights on the disabled; it simply requires business owners
to provide reasonable accommodations to the disabled to make their
experience roughly equal to that of a person without disabilities.

An Order of Protection applies *equally* to people with and without
disabilities. Therefore, the provisions of ADA are not violated when an
Order of Protection is in place. The Order of Protection would apply to
someone with a disability as it would to someone without a disability.
Because the order applies equally, both the disabled person and the
non-disabled person would still have equal access to the public
accommodation, and the rules of ADA are still satisfied.
