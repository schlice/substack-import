Because there will never be **none** to steal or purchase.

My dad was a police officer. Someone broke into our house when I was a
child and stole his duty revolver. So in order to eliminate all of the
guns which can be stolen, you'd have to remove all the guns from the
police and the military, too. I'm betting you weren't planning on doing
that.

And if you keep any of *those* guns around, criminals can offer *lots
and lots of money* to buy some of those guns from the cops or the
military. Don't think it won't happen. And don't forget that police
stations have been raided and guns have been stolen. It happens more
often than you think, and probably happened a lot more recently than
you're aware.

The gun market is much like your senses. If you take one away, the rest
become heightened. If you take away one avenue to acquire guns, the
other ones gain prominence and importance. And criminals are really,
really good at smuggling things into the United States. You may not be
able to buy a gun at the local gun store (because you made those
illegal), but you can always walk into the bad part of town and buy a
gun right out of the trunk of Big Joe's car, and the best part is there
are no forms to fill out! You just hand Big Joe some cash, and you walk
away with a gun in your waistband. No law will ever stop Big Joe (none
of them stop him today). And if you arrest Big Joe, then Slim and Fast
Eddie will be waiting in the wings to take over sales in his patch.

Also, don't discount ingenuity. You can make a zip gun with like \$50
worth of parts from your local home improvement store. Improvised
weapons range from the crude and downright dangerous to both the people
involved all the way up to cottage industries which repurpose old parts
and turn them into decent-functioning, reasonably reliable firearms.
Unless you can simultaneously remove all the guns and the knowledge of
how to make a gun, they will always be around, and sales will always
happen. And don't forget that 3-D printing is getting better and better
all the time, so these cottage industries don't have to fabricate too
much, usually just the barrel, and they can 3-D print the rest.

In short, the only thing your new rule does is to remove the guns and
the gun sales to the lawful gun owners. It removes the ability of the
**law-abiding citizen** to continue to use their firearms in lawful
ways. And criminals can **always** get guns. Because they're criminals.
They don't care what laws you write.

Why doesn't American gun activists realise that criminals can't get guns
if there is none to steal or purchase?
