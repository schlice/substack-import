Indeed, one of the most common eye issues associated with MS, oftentimes
the very first symptom of the disease (and my first symptom,
incidentally) is called **retrobulbar optic neuritis**, or just optic
neuritis (ON).

ON is a condition caused by swelling in the optic nerve just behind the
eyeball. It is characterized by vision changes (blurry vision, visual
auras such as sparkles or stars, dim vision, or changes in color vision)
and pain while looking away from center. It usually occurs in just one
eye. ON, while potentially frightening, does generally resolve on its
own. In some cases, it can leave some residual effects, and some can
worsen in the heat (cool off the body to get them to return to normal).

Other vision issues which are less common with MS are nystagmus
(uncontrolled eye movements) and diplopia (double vision).
