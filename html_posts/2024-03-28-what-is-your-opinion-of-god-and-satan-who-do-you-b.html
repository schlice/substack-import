This is an interesting question. You're asking, in a forum of believers,
whether or not they support God or Satan. I don't think you're going to
get a lot of surprising answers.

I think the only thing that might be useful would be to learn how they
came about. Why would God create Satan? And since God knows all, why
would God create Satan if He knew that all this would happen?

Let's start with who Satan is. Satan started off his existence as
Lucifer, a created angel. The Morning Star, or "son of the morning" as
is depicted in Isaiah 14:12:

> How you have fallen from heaven, O morning star, son of the dawn! You
> have been cast down to the earth, you who once laid low the nations!
> ---NIV

That little bit of foreshadowing talks about what happened to Lucifer.
Lucifer, like all the angels, is a created being, and he had free will
just like all the angels did. He could make his own choices. Lucifer
possesses a voice the quality of which is unmatched by any other being
in existence. As a created being, Lucifer's job was, like for all of the
other angels, to worship God. Lucifer was to use that "angelic voice" to
sing praises to God. Lucifer though, for whatever reason, *wanted that
glory for himself.* He didn't want God to get all the glory. He wanted
glory. He didn't want to worship God. He wanted others to worship *him*.

And so he rebelled (along with about a third of the angels). Ultimately,
he was cast out of heaven and down to the earth, and the angels who
rebelled with him were also cast out, and exist as demons.

*But why would God have done this if He knew that Lucifer would rebel?
Why create him at all?*

Ultimately, it is because God so loves free will. God does not want
mindless automatons worshipping Him. He doesn't need that (as an
all-powerful God, He has no needs, as He is complete). But He desires
His creation to worship freely, to love freely (for love can only be
freely given, it can never be coerced). Free will, and the ability to
make choices, is paramount to God.

Satan existing as an agitating force, existing as our very accuser, only
reinforces the free will aspect of God's creation. Satan only serves now
to agitate against us, and to accuse us of wrongdoing (which he may or
may not have goaded and influenced us into committing). Of course, it is
Jesus on our side, pleading for our souls, so there's that.

Allowing Satan to introduce sin into the human condition was all part of
God's plan to redeem us and give us that choice to love Him or to reject
Him without violating our free will. God created a perfect free-will
environment in which anyone who chooses to believe will recognize all
the evidence of God's existence, but He has also left just enough
ambiguity so as to not coerce the unwilling. Again, God only wants
willing believers, not coerced or brainwashed believers. And He has
created an environment filled with evidence of His existence *but
without His direct presence*, a presence so powerful that it would
coerce our belief and overcome our free will.
