**What is the law in North Carolina regarding home renter responsibility
for trees on rental property? My landlord is saying I am responsible for
the removal and replacement of a tree that died.**

First of all, what does your lease say?

If the lease does not say anything, then in general, the renter is
responsible to maintain all of the area he rented. If you routinely mow
the lawn, it's because you rented the house and the property around it.

However, while the renter may be tasked with "maintaining" the tree, the
renter does not "own" the tree. The landlord ultimately owns the tree,
as the landlord owns all of the property. If a water heater dies, it's
not the tenant's responsibility to replace it, because the landlord owns
it. Similarly, if a tree dies, it's not the tenant's responsibility to
replace it, because the tenant doesn't "own" the tree.

If the landlord is claiming that you killed the tree, he should replace
it and then sue you to get the amount of the tree back. He shouldn't be
relying on you to remove and replace the tree.

In NC, you do have the right to "repair and deduct" if the landlord will
not fix the problem. In your case, if the tree is large and its death
poses a hazard (i.e. a falling tree could damage property), you can
remove the dead tree and deduct the cost of that maintenance from your
lease payments (and you're not responsible for planing a new tree,
either). Be sure you understand what that may mean for your future
leasing of the property, though.

It means you may end up having your lease terminated, and a negative hit
on your credit. It also means you may end up in small claims court.

You could also reach out to your renter's insurance company and ask them
what they think you should do. It's possible that your renter's
insurance policy would cover this; however, this is really unlikely.

If this all seems too much to try to sort though, you might want to
consider retaining a local real estate attorney in your area.
