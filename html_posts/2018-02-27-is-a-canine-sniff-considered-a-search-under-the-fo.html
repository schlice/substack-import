**Is a canine sniff considered a search under the Fourth Amendment?**

Of course it's a search. But depending on the circumstances, it *might*
be a search covered by the 4th Amendment, or it might not.

For example, if a dog smells the *outside* of a car and alerts on drugs,
this is covered under what the courts call the "plain smell" test,
established in *United States v. Miller* \[812 F.2d 1206 (9th Cir.
1987)\]. The "plain smell" doctrine is a corrolary to the "plain sight"
exception to the 4th Amendment. The search is not considered
"unreasonable" if the illegal item is in plain sight of the officer, or
in this case, plain smell.
