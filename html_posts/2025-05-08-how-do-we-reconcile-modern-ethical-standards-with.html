This is an absolutely fantastic question! If you are truly seeking to
understand this answer, you can address many of the questions that
modern-day atheists love to trot out against Christianity. These are
things like "God is evil," "God can't even hold to His own standards,"
and the one that I love, "God is a murderer."

So let's answer a few of these questions together, like "Does the Bible
endorse slavery?" and "Is God a murderer for killing people?" and see if
we can understand these questions, how apologists answer these
questions, and maybe draw some inductive conclusions about how we
reconcile modern ethical standards against historical texts.

Before we get into the specifics, it's important to understand that
you've basically answered part of the first question within your
question: **you cannot judge historical societies through a modern
lens.** Our standards are far different than the standards which existed
2000 years ago. In just one example, slavery was a fact of life 2000
years ago. Taking conquered people as slaves was common. Selling
yourself into indentured servitude was common also. Today, those things
are quite abhorrent to the modern-day person, but back then, those
things were culturally acceptable, and even considered quite normal.
Expecting the Bible to do something it was never intended to do is a
fault of the reader, not the Bible.

We can expound on these ideas by looking more closely at some of the
most common objections that modern readers have to what they
uncritically read in the Bible.

\

**The Bible endorses slavery.**

This is a common misunderstanding of the fact that the Bible does not
outright *condemn* slavery. That's really hard for the modern man to
accept.

Besides what we've already discussed regarding the lens though which we
view history, we should go further. Modern people (especially people in
the United States, where slavery was officially abolished in the 1800s)
tend to think of slavery as a thing which happened in the *past*, but
this is far from the truth. Slavery still exists today, and worldwide,
slavery (specifically chattel slavery, involuntary servitude) has
*grown* since the US abolished slavery. Today, it is estimated that over
27 million people in the world are subject to slavery (i.e. forced
labor, sex trade, inheritable property, etc).

Also, while not immediately condemning slavery, what it *does* do is put
**guardrails** around slavery. It provides rules for Hebrews to follow
when it comes to the treatment of slaves. These rules for slaves and
slaveowners were *revolutionary* for the time. You must treat your
slaves as if they are your family??? Scandalous! Exodus 21 even gives
more "scandalous" rules for how Hebrews are to treat their slaves, such
as the right to keep a wife (verse 3), the right not to be sold to
foreigners (verse 8), the right to be adopted into a family by marriage
(verse 9), and the right to food and clothing (verse 10). The law also
limited masters in their use of corporal punishment (verses 20, 26--27).

Additionally, we need to recognize that the Bible was not written to
effect *political* change. The Bible was written to effect *individual
change*, and then those changed people go on to make social and
political change. Indeed, in nations where Christianity spread and took
firm hold, slavery was brought to an end through the efforts of those
newly-saved Christians. The seeds of change needed to end slavery are
already in the Bible: the truth that all men are created by God and made
in His image (Genesis 1:27), the condemnation of those who kidnap and
sell a person (Exodus 21:16; cf. 1 Timothy 1:8--10), and that a slave
can truly be "a brother in the Lord" (Philemon 1:16).

So when people deny the Bible because it doesn't immediately demand the
cessation of every ingrained, centuries-old sinful custom of the day, we
can rest assured that the Bible prefers to change people, and they go on
to change others. *Changed people change people.*

**God is a murderer**

This is another little tidbit of cognitive dissonance which is very
easily defeated logically, but one which confounds the human heart.
People will see passages in the Bible about the armies of the Israelites
slaughtering entire cities full of women and children and conclude that
God kills "innocent people," or even when God sent the Flood to destroy
all of the people in the world except Noah and his family. Surely some
of those deaths could be considered murder, no?

The logical argument made by apologists is an easy one to make:
***ground your morality***. By what moral standard do you judge God and
find Him lacking? What moral standard is God subjected to, which you can
show that He knowingly violated? They can never do it. This is the one
question which atheists cannot answer. There is no moral standard higher
than God, as there is no standard above God. *God is the standard*.
Therefore, if God does it, it is *de facto* moral.

*But what about all the dead people?* *Doesn't that make God a
murderer?*

First, we must recognize that there is a difference between *killing*
and *murder*. Legally speaking, *homicide* is defined as "the taking of
a human life." It doesn't talk about the justification of that taking.
Some homicides have valid reasons, and we would characterize those as
"justifiable homicide." But in the realm of "unjustifiable homicide," we
find crimes like *manslaughter* and *murder*.

So we can see, right off the bat, we see that *murder* is minimally
defined as "homicide which is not justified" (along with some other
legal qualifications). So does God commit murder? Since murder means
that the homicide is done without justification, can we point to a time
when God took a life without justification? In analyzing the Bible, we
find that we cannot. God had already judged every single person who He
killed, or who He had others kill on His behalf.

*Even the people in Deuternonmy, when God ordered the armies of Israel
to destroy whole cities, and all those women and children? Weren't they
innocent?*

Actually, no, they were not. Nowhere in Scripture can we find where God
killed "innocent" people. In fact, compared to God's holiness, there is
no such thing as an "innocent" person. All have sinned (Romans 3:23),
and the penalty for sin is death (Romans 6:23a). God has "just cause" to
wipe us all out; the fact that He doesn't is proof of His mercy.

*But what about the whole world in the Flood? God literally judged every
single person? You're saying no one was innocent?*

Well, yes. The Bible makes that clear:

> *The LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and
> that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil
> continually. \-- Genesis 6:5 ESV*

The bottom line about death: every person dies in God's own time
(Hebrews 9:27; Genesis 3:19). Jesus holds the keys of death (Revelation
1:18). Does the fact that everyone experiences physical death make God a
*killer*? In the sense that He could prevent all death, yes. He allows
us to die. And in the sense that He does cause some people who have
sinned to be killed, yes. But does that make Him a *murderer*. Not at
all; God is no *murderer.* Death is part of the human experience because
we brought it into the world ourselves (Romans 5:12). One day, as John
Donne put it, "Death shall be no more; death, thou shalt die." God, in
His grace, has conquered death for those who are in Christ, and one day
that truth will be fully realized: "The last enemy to be subdued and
abolished is death" (1 Corinthians 15:26).

Hopefully this was helpful in understanding the truth behind some things
which confuse humans because we possess limited human minds, and God's
mind is infinite.

> *For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways,
> declares the LORD. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so
> are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.
> \-- Isaiah 55:8--9 ESV*

We should always keep in mind that when we study the Bible, we must
interpret it as the people of its time would have interpreted it.
Understanding the real meaning of the Bible includes using the right
"lenses" to look through while we read it. Using modern-day "lenses" to
view the Bible always results in a distorted view of its truth.
