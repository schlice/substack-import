I have spent many years as a System Administrator, so this information
comes from my experience while all of this was developed.

Your employer has the right to monitor anything you do on the employer
network and using employer computers, including monitoring things you do
in secured browsing sessions (like checking your personal email and
logging in to your bank account). If you use a company network, you are
bound by that monitoring agreement. By extension, if you send a personal
email over a company network, that email can be reviewed and monitored
by the employer to ensure that the use of company resources follows
business practices. When you log on to a company computer, you are
usually presented with a banner that explains this, and you usually just
click OK without thinking twice. That\'s what the banner actually says.
But even without the banner, you usually sign a "Key Employee Agreement"
when you hire on which states that you agree to the IT policies, which
include monitoring your actions while using company resources.

It would seem, then, that your employer has *carte blanche* to pry into
your personal doings at will. However, the right they retain to monitor
your use of company devices **does not** give your employer the right to
bypass your password protections and log in to your personal accounts.
This is highly illegal in almost every jurisdiction that I know of, and
likely **violates the company\'s** **own privacy practices**. I don\'t
know of any companies that allow keyloggers to monitor their employees\'
personal passwords, and I have worked on some of the nation\'s most
secure computer networks (by the way, the most secure networks don\'t
allow access to personal webmail; you can\'t even reach those sites from
those networks). If your company allows this, it\'s time to find a new
job, since they have no respect for privacy. There is a difference
between monitoring company networks for appropriate use and respecting
an employee\'s privacy. Some might think these two concepts are
intertwined, but in actuality, they are very clear. Administrators can
easily get this information (like your passwords), but they never would,
and nor should they need to.

Your first step should be creating a new Gmail account and migrating as
much of your personal mail over there as you can. Don\'t delete the old
one or remove everything from it though. If you do that, you may tip off
your boss that you\'re on to him. And most importantly: NEVER log on to
your new personal email from work if you expect it to remain private.
Even if they don\'t keylog your password, they can still watch what you
send and receive. Logging in from work removes your expectation of
privacy over what you send and receive.

Next, contact your employer\'s Legal department and your employer\'s
Information Security department. If you don\'t have an InfoSec
department in your company, start with Legal. As I said, it\'s very
likely that using keystroke loggers violates the company\'s own
information security policies, so this boss is violating the company
rules. Legal needs to take that action.

So first, protect yourself, and second, start legal action against this
boss. If the company doesn\'t appear to accept your statements or
doesn\'t take any action, it\'s time to get yourself a good lawyer and
get yourself a new job.

EDIT: Another poster recommended enabling Gmail\'s 2-step authentication
system, and if you don\'t want to go through the time and headache of
opening a new mail account, you can simply add 2-step authentication.
This is something that I HIGHLY recommend to everyone that uses Gmail.
Most networks (probably your own company network) requires
\"two-factor\" authentication already if you wish to sign in from
outside the physical network. Two-factor authentication uses two
separate \"factors\" to allow you access; usually \"something you know\"
like a password, and \"something you have\" like a key fob or a mobile
phone. Google\'s 2-step authentication is essentially two-factor
authentication in two steps. Step one is \"something you know\" where
you enter your password. Step two is \"something you have\" which is
your cell phone. Google texts a code to your cell phone which you then
enter into the Gmail screen. The combination of \"something you know\"
and \"something you have\" is far more secure than just your password
alone. Someone can get your password with a keystroke logger, but
without the brand-new 6-digit code, they can\'t get in.

Google also offers an app called \"Google Authenticator\" which
generates
[[pseudo-random](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b5ae8e&url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandomness){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} 6-digit codes every
minute. Instead of having a 6-digit number sent to you over SMS, the
number is available any time in the app. So for Step two, you launch the
app, enter the code displayed in the app into your Gmail screen, and
you\'re in. On the plus side, the app is always available, even if your
cell phone signal is not. On the downside (and this is a downside for
2-step authentication, not the app), 2-step authentication is not
available in all applications that can access Gmail (notably in the
iPhone/iPad mail app). For those, you have to generate a single-use
password through Google Security settings for that particular app to use
(or for any app that fails when trying to log in because it doesn\'t
support 2-step authentication).
