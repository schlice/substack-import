<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I have spent many years as a System Administrator, so this information<br>comes from my experience while all of this was developed.<br><br>Your employer has the right to monitor anything you do on the employer<br>network and using employer computers, including monitoring things you do<br>in secured browsing sessions (like checking your personal email and<br>logging in to your bank account). If you use a company network, you are<br>bound by that monitoring agreement. By extension, if you send a personal<br>email over a company network, that email can be reviewed and monitored<br>by the employer to ensure that the use of company resources follows<br>business practices. When you log on to a company computer, you are<br>usually presented with a banner that explains this, and you usually just<br>click OK without thinking twice. That\'s what the banner actually says.<br>But even without the banner, you usually sign a "Key Employee Agreement"<br>when you hire on which states that you agree to the IT policies, which<br>include monitoring your actions while using company resources.<br><br>It would seem, then, that your employer has *carte blanche* to pry into<br>your personal doings at will. However, the right they retain to monitor<br>your use of company devices does not give your employer the right to<br>bypass your password protections and log in to your personal accounts.<br>This is highly illegal in almost every jurisdiction that I know of, and<br>likely violates the company\'s own privacy practices. I don\'t<br>know of any companies that allow keyloggers to monitor their employees\'<br>personal passwords, and I have worked on some of the nation\'s most<br>secure computer networks (by the way, the most secure networks don\'t<br>allow access to personal webmail; you can\'t even reach those sites from<br>those networks). If your company allows this, it\'s time to find a new<br>job, since they have no respect for privacy. There is a difference<br>between monitoring company networks for appropriate use and respecting<br>an employee\'s privacy. Some might think these two concepts are<br>intertwined, but in actuality, they are very clear. Administrators can<br>easily get this information (like your passwords), but they never would,<br>and nor should they need to.<br><br>Your first step should be creating a new Gmail account and migrating as<br>much of your personal mail over there as you can. Don\'t delete the old<br>one or remove everything from it though. If you do that, you may tip off<br>your boss that you\'re on to him. And most importantly: NEVER log on to<br>your new personal email from work if you expect it to remain private.<br>Even if they don\'t keylog your password, they can still watch what you<br>send and receive. Logging in from work removes your expectation of<br>privacy over what you send and receive.<br><br>Next, contact your employer\'s Legal department and your employer\'s<br>Information Security department. If you don\'t have an InfoSec<br>department in your company, start with Legal. As I said, it\'s very<br>likely that using keystroke loggers violates the company\'s own<br>information security policies, so this boss is violating the company<br>rules. Legal needs to take that action.<br><br>So first, protect yourself, and second, start legal action against this<br>boss. If the company doesn\'t appear to accept your statements or<br>doesn\'t take any action, it\'s time to get yourself a good lawyer and<br>get yourself a new job.<br><br>EDIT: Another poster recommended enabling Gmail\'s 2-step authentication<br>system, and if you don\'t want to go through the time and headache of<br>opening a new mail account, you can simply add 2-step authentication.<br>This is something that I HIGHLY recommend to everyone that uses Gmail.<br>Most networks (probably your own company network) requires<br>\"two-factor\" authentication already if you wish to sign in from<br>outside the physical network. Two-factor authentication uses two<br>separate \"factors\" to allow you access; usually \"something you know\"<br>like a password, and \"something you have\" like a key fob or a mobile<br>phone. Google\'s 2-step authentication is essentially two-factor<br>authentication in two steps. Step one is \"something you know\" where<br>you enter your password. Step two is \"something you have\" which is<br>your cell phone. Google texts a code to your cell phone which you then<br>enter into the Gmail screen. The combination of \"something you know\"<br>and \"something you have\" is far more secure than just your password<br>alone. Someone can get your password with a keystroke logger, but<br>without the brand-new 6-digit code, they can\'t get in.<br><br>Google also offers an app called \"Google Authenticator\" which<br>generates<br>[pseudo-random(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b5ae8e&url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandomness){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} 6-digit codes every<br>minute. Instead of having a 6-digit number sent to you over SMS, the<br>number is available any time in the app. So for Step two, you launch the<br>app, enter the code displayed in the app into your Gmail screen, and<br>you\'re in. On the plus side, the app is always available, even if your<br>cell phone signal is not. On the downside (and this is a downside for<br>2-step authentication, not the app), 2-step authentication is not<br>available in all applications that can access Gmail (notably in the<br>iPhone/iPad mail app). For those, you have to generate a single-use<br>password through Google Security settings for that particular app to use<br>(or for any app that fails when trying to log in because it doesn\'t<br>support 2-step authentication).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
