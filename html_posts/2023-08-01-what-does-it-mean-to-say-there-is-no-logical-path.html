Here is the strained logic:

- God does something.
- If I were God, I would not do it that way.
- Therefore, there is no God.

Unfortunately, this does not logically follow. You cannot get from "If I
were God, I would not have done it that way" to "there is no God"
without some intermediate step showing how me not being God means that
God does not exist.
