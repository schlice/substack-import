**What would be the likely consequences for the IRS if it didn't comply
with the House\'s request for Trump\'s tax returns?**

Congress will have to file suit against the IRS, and then the IRS will
get to explain why Congress' request is not in line with IRS regulation
section 6103(f).

The purpose of retrieving tax returns under 6103(f) is to audit the IRS,
and ensure that the IRS is following applicable law. It is also to be
used in research for legislation. Congress can check to see that the IRS
is implementing tax code correctly and fairly. Congress can also ensure
that the IRS is properly auditing the President's tax returns.

*This* Congress, on the other hand, is attempting to use 6103(f) to
audit an **individual**, not the **IRS**.

You can tell because Congress requested tax returns for at least one or
two years (I can't remember which off the top of my head) before the
President was actually president. This indicates that they are
attempting to check on the IRS' treatment of *this* taxpayer, not how
the IRS operates. This implies that this request is more about the
individual taxpayer than the IRS' treatment of that taxpayer.

Let's be clear: **no law gives Congress the power to audit any
individual taxpayer.** **That is exclusively the IRS' job**. The law is
in place so that Congress can oversee the IRS, unless Congress is
investigating a specific tax-related crime. There is no tax-related
crime which the President is accused of committing. The law does not
allow Congress to go on fishing expeditions, which this clearly is.

Because Congress' intent is clear from both what they have publicly
stated and from the details of their request, the IRS will likely refuse
the request. If they have questions about how the IRS handled the
President's tax returns, they can subpoena any member of the IRS to
testify to that handling. There is no need to request confidential tax
returns in order to understand how they handled those returns.

Additionally, if they want to ensure that the IRS is handling the
President's returns correctly, they should only be requesting the
returns from when he was President, not for at least a year or two
*before* he was President.

Finally, it's clear that there is at least a better than average chance
that once Congress gets hold of those returns, someone is going to leak
them. While I'm sure it's not quite a huge deal for the President, it is
indeed a huge deal for any companies which he owns which are reported on
his return. It could potentially reveal a great deal of information
about how his companies run (not things they did illegally, but just how
they operate) which could prove to be financially ruinous to those
companies.
