Because he knows that he can't jail Trump. He's about to be sworn in as
the 47th President of the United States, having been elected President
by a majority of Americans who knew full well that his court had
convicted Trump of 34 felonies.

But while Merchan said that sending Trump to jail is "impractical" now
that he is about to re-enter the office of the President, he doesn't
think that vacating the conviction is practical, either.

So instead, he appears likely to simply sentence Trump (on January 10th,
when sentencing is set) to an "unconditional discharge." This means no
custody, no fine, and no probation. He's technically "sentenced," but
there is no sentence to be carried out.

So in this way, everyone "wins." New York still gets to call Trump a
convicted felon, Trump gets to finally pursue his options for appeal
(which he couldn't do without being sentenced), and Merchan gets to say
he convicted Trump on 34 felony counts, regardless of what the Court of
Appeals does. The Democrats get their label, the one they have been
fighting for the past eight years to get: Trump will be, following his
sentencing, a "convicted felon." It will be *official*. He will have
been tried, found guilty, and sentenced. The Democrats can smugly wag
their collective fingers at everyone who voted for Trump and now they
can look down on *literally half of the voting population of America*
and say that they knowingly elected a convicted felon. **In short,
Democrats gain a moral victory**, if only in their own minds.

But does Merchan really *win* here? Imagine being convicted on 34 felony
counts, and no punishment. It's like getting a speeding ticket for doing
186 in a 20 mile per hour school zone and being let off with a warning.
34 felonies should get you life without parole, not an unconditional
discharge.

Imposing this sentence means Merchan knows he can't win at all, even if
he tried. So he's caving. He's caving to the pressure that Trump's legal
team was bringing to either shit or get off the pot. Either vacate the
conviction, or sentence so that he can begin his appeals.

But is it possible to appeal an unconditional discharge? Technically yes
it is, but what are you appealing? There is no punishment, so there's
not quite as much to appeal. Trump's legal team will still likely appeal
the procedural errors Merchan made in things like jury instructions, but
the unconditional discharge means that there is *less* for Trump to
appeal.

This sentence will be the cop-out of the century on top of the biggest
sham trial of the century, but it's the only play Merchan has left.
After his absolute kangaroo court, this is the only move he can make.
It's the least bad choice from a slate of really bad choices.

And the incoming administration won't let this type of lawfare go on for
any longer. The people who prosecuted these cases will be investigated,
and some may be charged criminally as well. Looking at you, Jack Smith
and Fani Willis and Alvin Bragg.

The great rule given to prosecutors is "thou shalt not recognize faces."
You don't prosecute someone for *who they are*. You prosecute someone
for *what they've done*. These people violated that cardinal rule of
prosecutions because they took the last eight years trying to find
anything to **get Trump**. And ultimately, they completely failed, so
they had to make up charges and find a willing patsy of a judge to push
the conviction through. This sad obsession with "getting Trump" will be
their downfall.
