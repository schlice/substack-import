**Can someone with Constitutional Law knowledge explain how the 5th
amendment doesn\'t apply to police officers killing unarmed suspects?**

Everyone's done a great job here explaining why the 5th Amendment
doesn't apply in situations of deadly force application. [[Miles
Eastman](https://www.quora.com/profile/Miles-Eastman-1)]{.qlink_container}'s
answer is particularly astute at unpacking the issue, so read through
that a few times.

But you also brought up another canard that I want to address: "**police
officers killing unarmed suspects**" as if "unarmed" equates to "not
dangerous."

This issue of shooting people who are "unarmed" has been literally
beaten to death on Quora for several years now. Check out some of the
answers we've already given to those questions for more background
information.

But in short, police officers are as free as any other citizen to
protect themselves against death or grave bodily harm. You probably know
what death is, but what's grave bodily harm? The definition varies from
state to state, but in most states, grave bodily injury (GBI) or grave
bodily harm can cause temporary or permanent disfigurement or loss of
one or more major bodily functions, or protracted impairment of
functioning of any body part or organ or limb, or any similar injury.
For example, if you punch someone in the head and you break the orbital
cavity which holds the eyeball, you can cause permanent blindness in
that eye. This would be an example of grave bodily injury. But in case
you missed the upshot of this: **you can cause grave bodily injury
without being armed.**

Any citizen can protect themselves with deadly force against the threat
of death or grave bodily injury. Police officers are included in that
"any citizen" mix.
