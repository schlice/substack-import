**Could a long term high functioning alcoholic appeal a DUI on the
grounds that their tolerance is so high they are in no way impaired to
drive?**

The problem is that a DUI stop is made on the basis of visually
identifying driving impairment. The entire reasonable suspicion case is
built on the officer observing driving behavior which indicates
impairment.

Impairment + BAC out of limits = DUI.

The visualization of the impaired driving is the reasonable suspicion. A
failed FST or Breathalyzer and you have probable cause.

You cannot subsequently make a case that the basis for the stop was
unlawful because you are such a high-functioning alcoholic that you're
not impaired. The officer observed impaired driving, which is why you
were stopped initially anyway. You went on to fail a FST, which if your
claim was accurate, you would not do. Your BAC, either read at the
roadside or back at the station, would be the nail in the coffin.
Regardless of how high functioning and how tolerant you may be, the law
does not allow for tolerance. The law says that if you have a BAC over
0.08, you cannot drive. No exceptions.
