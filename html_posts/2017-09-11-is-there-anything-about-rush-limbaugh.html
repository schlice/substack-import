Wow. Before you comment about something you think you heard from someone
else, check the original source.

You probably won't hear this from anyone in the news media, because they
are part of the problem.

Anyway, nothing of the sort happened. At. All. But the Drive-By Media
decided to spin this as "Rush wants people to die" because he doesn't
think like them. He's the biggest name in media who doesn't follow the
media's party line.

So here's Rush

Fake news run amok. I am continually surprised at the level of fake news
that is making headlines and truly influencing ordinary Americans.

So to answer your specific question: **No, nothing Rush Limbaugh said
even comes close to the very narrow exceptions carved out of the First
Amendment.** He did not incite anyone to violence. There was no libel or
slander: there was no knowing misrepresentation of the truth (the truth,
at the time, were the predicted hurricane tracks all over the map, and
while they didn't want to hear it, he was right about that).
