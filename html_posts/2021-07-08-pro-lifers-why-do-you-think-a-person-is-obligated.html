Pro-life and pro-choice people have one major difference in philosophy:

**The pro-life movement believes that the life of a human being**
***deserves to be protected at any stage of development.***

**The pro-choice movement believes that the life of a human being**
***has differential value based on temporal circumstances.***

Saying something like "a fetus is not a person" or saying "a fetus is
not alive" are silly, and have already been disproven by science. Those
things they say are just cover to allow them the mental justification to
take a human life. Everything else is just fodder. I mean, some things
are definitely issues, like "pro life people don't care about the baby
after it is born" and while that may or may not be true (we can
certainly debate that), it has no bearing on whether or not it is
morally acceptable to kill a fetus. You can absolutely make those
arguments (and I expect the comments to light up with people telling me
that I just want women barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen, that I
believe women are nothing more than babymaking machines, "no uterus, no
opinion", etc), but all of that is ancillary. This is the real,
unvarnished truth about each movement.

Because pro-choicers don't value life in its earliest stages in the same
way or to the same degree, they find it morally acceptable to kill it.
Since pro-lifers value life equally at all stages of its development, we
believe that the fetus has rights, and one of those rights is the right
to life.

Therefore, we believe a person is obligated (in most circumstances) to
carry a fetus to term and then give it up for adoption if you don't want
it.

Original question:

Pro-lifers, why do you think a person is obligated to carry a fetus and
give birth when they are pregnant?

*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.
Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a
civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not
misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously, and I have no tolerance
for harassing or inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough
shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion
masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your
own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site.
If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\"
don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything
vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be followed by a
block/mute, and a BNBR report. I will do this immediately and with no
compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*
