Oh. you mean like the people who say, "not my President?" News flash:
while you may not have voted for him, he is your president.

In just the same way, you had a vote. You either said "guilty" or "not
guilty," and that vote expresses your opinion as to whether or not the
evidence sufficiently proved that the defendant did what he was accused
of doing.

That's the only opinion you get to give as a juror. Giving other
opinions means *you may not understand your job as a juror*, and could
actually result in a mistrial.

So I'd suggest that you say exactly what you are supposed to say, and
nothing more, or you could jeopardize the entire proceeding, meaning the
state would have to expend more money and resources to retry the case
after your uninformed comment.

Just to be clear, the court does not look favorably upon those who waste
its time, or whose recklessness cause its time to be wasted.

Don't be that person.

Original question:

During the polling of the Parkland jury, would it have been appropriate
for any juror to say "no, the verdict is not my verdict"?
