People make a ***value judgment*** and compare cars to any other product
commercially available on the market, like toasters, blenders, and
refrigerators. They say, "these products are made cheaply, with
components which wear out faster, and are not designed to last." People
then incorrectly assign these product characteristics to cars.

This is incorrect for many reasons, but primarily because auto
manufacturers are under some of the strictest government guidelines
controlling their products, far stricter than any other product
manufacturer.

For example, you may have noticed a strong trend in the auto industry
towards smaller engines and the addition of turbochargers to make up for
the difference in BHP (brake horsepower). This was not caused by any
trend in buying habits (as the rest of the manufactured goods markets
are), it was caused by government clean-air regulations. Fuel efficiency
can only be increased so far, as far as physics allows, so in order to
increase fuel efficiency further than physics (which is normally
impossible), the only thing which can be done is to reduce the size of
the engine. Smaller engines burn less fuel and therefore, by default,
run more "efficiently" in terms of miles per gallon. But that reduction
in engine size reduces the power output of the engine, which is why
turbochargers were added.
