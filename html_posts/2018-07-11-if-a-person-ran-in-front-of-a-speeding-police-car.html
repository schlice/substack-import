**If a person ran in front of a speeding police car and had a signed DNR
form, would the police respect the DNR? Or would they turn into bullies
and get you to the hospital so you could get better and they could
arrest you?**

I'm not sure the first responder would even know of, or care about, a
DNR. ***In most cases, they're not for the first responder. They're for
the hospital.***

A DNR is a "Do-Not-Resuscitate" order. It basically says that a doctor
cannot resuscitate a patient in the hospital whose heart stops or who
has no pulse. It is not an order to withhold *all* treatment. Secondly,
a DNR comes from a *doctor*, not a patient. In order to get a DNR, you
must discuss the situation with your doctor before he or she will issue
the order. DNRs are written orders and are on file with the hospital.

Getting a first responder to both know about, and abide by, a DNR can be
challenging, especially if you are incapacitated. Perhaps a Medic-Alert
bracelet with your DNR information printed on it might help, but Good
Samaritans are not bound by DNRs as they are not medical professionals.
So if you get hit by a police car and a civilian stops and renders first
aid, including CPR, you cannot hold them liable for failing to follow
your DNR.

Whether or not first responders (i.e. police), EMTs or paramedics are
bound by valid DNR orders varies by state. Some states require DNR
orders on a specific form; if it's not on that form, first responders
are not required to comply. Other states will allow any DNR order signed
by a doctor to be honored by paramedics. And again, it only applies to
*resuscitation*. It does not preclude *all* first aid. It only applies
when the heart stops and there is no pulse.

Finally, police wouldn't want you to get better so they can arrest you.
They'd want you to get better so you can receive psychological care for
attempting to commit suicide using a police car.
