The answer is "it depends."

There are several situations under which the police can search without
probable cause and without consent:

- Plain sight. If contraband is visible in plain sight (and the "plain
  smell" test falls under the same plain sight exception), the vehicle
  can be searched and no other probable cause or consent is needed.
- Search incident to arrest. If you are being arrested, you and your car
  can be searched.
