Since we're in the MS Forum, I'll answer for MS.

MS presents itself most generally between ages 20 and 50; however, it
does present in some significantly younger and older people (Pediatric
MS and Late Onset MS, or LOMS, respectively).

Symptoms are the same as any other time. There are common first
symptoms, like cognitive decline, vertigo, optic neuritis, etc., but any
of the MS symptoms can present as a "first symptom."
