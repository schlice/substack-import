**Is there any acupuncture kind of treatment for multiple sclerosis?**

Multiple sclerosis has many symptoms, and they are different for each
person.

While acupuncture is not useful to treat MS itself (the demyelinating
disease), acupuncture can be useful to treat some of its symptoms. When
used in conjunction with traditional therapies, complementary and
alternative medicine can be useful to improve quality of life and to
alleviate symptoms.
