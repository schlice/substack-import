**Content:** [What most of the answers are missing here is that
according to the Posse Comitatus Act, the military cannot enforce
civilian law, or act against citizens of the United States.\
\
The act of stopping any US citizen from firing a gun in a city or county
would first fall to the police. If there was an armed revolution, the
Governor would call out the National Guard. If the fully constituted
National Guard could not quell the insurrection, under the Insurrection
Act (the companion to the Posse Comitatus Act), the Governor can request
assistance from the US Government. Then, and only then, with the
President\'s approval, can the US military act to quash a revolution.\
\
It would have to be a mighty big revolution before the military
wouldn\'t be able to stop it.]{.rendered_qtext}
