**Is it a crime to fake a medical condition to get a better seat on a
plane?**

Short answer, yes.

Longer answer: If by "better seat" you mean a seat which you would
normally have to pay for in order to get, this is *theft*. It is also
fraud by misrepresentation.

In some cases, the airline might simply [[refuse to transport the
passenger](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=84f5c5&url=https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/woman-fakes-illness-flight-police-say/index.html){.external_link

theft, but it is indeed a crime in the United States.

We often see this with people who use their 1st Amendment right to
freedom of expression to wear military uniforms when they did not serve
in the military. You can feel free to wear a military uniform. You can
even feel free to claim you were in the military. All perfectly legal,
and Constitutionally protected. But once you use that uniform to get 10%
off your latte at Starbuck's, you're committing theft.
