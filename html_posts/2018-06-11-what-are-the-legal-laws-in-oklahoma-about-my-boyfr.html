**What are the legal laws in Oklahoma about my boyfriend having cameras
in our house but I don\'t know about them nor do my children?**

You said "he has cameras in the house" but "you don't know about them."
Are you saying that he told you that he has "hidden cameras" around the
home?

In general, the owner of the home can place security cameras in common
areas such as living rooms and hallways. Cameras (hidden or open) cannot
be placed in areas in which there is an expectation of privacy, such as
bedrooms and bathrooms. Cameras must be **video-only**, since recording
audio falls under separate Federal law. As long as the cameras are not
in areas in which there is a reasonable expectation of privacy, he
should be legally okay.

You asked about laws, but I think we'd be remiss if we didn't tackle the
camera question as a whole. If you believe that there are hidden cameras
in bedrooms or bathrooms, I'd confront him on it. Make him take them
out, or I'd extricate myself and my kids from that house. You and your
kids don't need that kind of boyfriend. He's not worth it. Leave him and
his cameras to himself.
