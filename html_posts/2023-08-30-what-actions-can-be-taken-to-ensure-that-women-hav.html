The *Dobbs* decision validated that abortion is not a Federal issue and
it is not a Constitutional right. Therefore, rightly, abortion is a
**state's rights** issue. You simply cannot **ensure** that all women
have access to safe and legal abortions. Full stop.

You can ensure that you live in a state which has added a right to
abortion into its state constitution. According to a July 2022 report,
10 states have state constitutions that protect abortion rights and
access. These states\' high courts have recognized that their state
constitutions protect abortion rights.

Beyond that, you can champion abortion rights in the other forty states
which do not have abortion rights enshrined in their state
constitutions. There are many groups which are actively working to
modify laws in those remaining states. You can look to contribute to
their efforts in some meaningful way. I would suggest you look at such
groups as Planned Parenthood and NARAL.
