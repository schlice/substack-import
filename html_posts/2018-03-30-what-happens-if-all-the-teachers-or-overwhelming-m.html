**What happens if all the teachers (or overwhelming majority) in a state
strike for a long period of time (longer than in West Virginia) and the
state refuses to budge?**

As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."

West Virginia is a unique case, because they do not have a right under
current state law to strike. Now, they're not violating a specific law,
so they aren't doing anything criminal, but because they do not have a
right to strike in state law, they could face disciplinary action, up to
and including termination.

If there are provisions that allow work stoppages in other states, that
could be grounds to allow for a strike. if such provisions exists, the
striking workers must follow those provisions and end the strike in
accordance with those laws.
