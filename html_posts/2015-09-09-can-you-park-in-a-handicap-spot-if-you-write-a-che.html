**Content:** [No, you can\'t pre-pay your parking tickets before you
receive them, as it would smell too much like a \"pay-to-park\" scheme,
even if it is \$100 or more per offense. As rates and fees can and often
do change, you need the actual ticket to write your check against.
Additionally, officers usually cannot directly process payments; they
must be made against a ticket directly to the state.\
\
Ticket first, then check in the mail. Or credit card online. You may be
able to use your phone to pay the ticket once you get back to the car,
depending on how advanced payment processing is in your state\'s
department of revenue. But you still have to enter the ticket number to
match the payment to.]{.rendered_qtext}
