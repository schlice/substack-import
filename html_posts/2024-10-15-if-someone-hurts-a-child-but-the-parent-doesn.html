In most states, the state's attorney can prosecute a case even without
the victim's cooperation or permission.

First, the crime is against the *state*, not against an individual. Yes,
there is a physical victim, but the case in court is called ***People***
*v. Joe Schmuckatelli.* The crime is against *the state*, not against
the victim. Therefore, the state's attorney does not need the
cooperation or the permission of the victim in order to prosecute, if
sufficient evidence of the crime is available without the victim's
(willing)ยน testimony.

This will particularly happen in cases of domestic violence. In a
disproportionate number of DV cases, the victim is too afraid to press
charges, and the state has a strong interest in protecting potential
future victims if the perpetrator is not stopped.

So if the "hurting of a child" is a *domestic violence* situation, the
district attorney will likely proceed with the case even if the victim
doesn't want to press charges.

ยน If the victim doesn't want to cooperate but their testimony is needed,
the DA can subpoena the victim and compel them to testify.
