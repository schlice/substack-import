The HOA should do their best to provide this to you. Either the HOA's
website, your personal homeowner portal, or the HOA Directors
themselves, should be able to provide you with all of the Governing
Documents.

However, if the HOA is unresponsive, you can always go to your city or
county, because the Governing Documents are official record, as they
have to be provided with every home sale. You can retrieve your HOA's
Governing Documents from them as well.
