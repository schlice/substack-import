In most jurisdictions in the US, you must dispose of the body correctly,
because a decomposing body produces toxic gases which are detrimental to
your health.

You could be charged with improper disposal of a corpse.

But what would be worse is the police investigation that would follow,
since innocent people who have nothing to hide will call the police to
come take the body away. Those who don\'t call generally have something
they want to hide. The police will want to find that.
