**Content:** [Adding to what Todd said, we\'ve answered this question a
few times on Quora. Unless you\'re going to be making money off of your
film, the basic rule of thumb is \"if you can see it, you can shoot
it.\" There are some exceptions around where you are when you shoot
(some Federal or military installations prohibit videography; ask
specifically about each one of those if you intend to video) and there
are some other exceptions to the \"making money\" rule if you are making
a video expressly for journalistic endeavors.\
\
So we need a little more information.\
\
- What kind of video are you making?\
- Where do you plan on shooting your video?\
- Are you planning on selling the video?\
- Are you planning on profiting from the sales of the video, or are your
incomes to be purely non-profit?]{.rendered_qtext}
