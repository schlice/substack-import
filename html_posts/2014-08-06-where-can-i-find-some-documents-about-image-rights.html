<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Adding to what Todd said, we\'ve answered this question a<br>few times on Quora. Unless you\'re going to be making money off of your<br>film, the basic rule of thumb is \"if you can see it, you can shoot<br>it.\" There are some exceptions around where you are when you shoot<br>(some Federal or military installations prohibit videography; ask<br>specifically about each one of those if you intend to video) and there<br>are some other exceptions to the \"making money\" rule if you are making<br>a video expressly for journalistic endeavors.\<br>\<br>So we need a little more information.\<br>\<br>- What kind of video are you making?\<br>- Where do you plan on shooting your video?\<br>- Are you planning on selling the video?\<br>- Are you planning on profiting from the sales of the video, or are your<br>incomes to be purely non-profit?]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
