**Do condominiums have bylaws on harassment? why or why not?**

Because bylaws and rules generally must follow a purpose, and that
purpose is generally twofold:

- Set the conditions so that one person's actions doesn't negatively
  impact the property value of someone else
- Set up rules for use and maintenance of common property.

Bylaws and rules are generally not re-writes of state or Federal law.

Harassment is a blanket term which involves both criminal and civil
activities. Some states define a criminal harassment law, but most
states have civil harassment penalties. Harassment is not something
which needs to be addressed in order to meet the property value or
common property goals for which bylaws or rules and regulations are
written.

**TL;DR: Harassment is not within the scope of a Condo Association or
HOA to address; it is for lawyers (or the police) to address. If you
suspect harassment, get a lawyer. If your state has a criminal
harassment law, call the police.**
