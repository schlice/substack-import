The modem\'s default address is 192.168.100.1, so you can review all the
settings by typing

[[http://192.168.1.100](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ecc2c4&url=http://192.168.1.100){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container}

into your browser\'s address bar. There\'s little to configure in the
modem itself; most configuration is done by your ISP. You can reboot the
modem and if your network happens to be directly connected to your modem
instead of through a NAT-based home router, you can change how the modem
assigns IP addresses to your devices.
