Assuming you had already been under investigation, it wouldn't be the
NSA. It would probably be the police.

With few exceptions, the only way your phone conversations could be
recorded and legally used against you in court is with a warrant.

We already know that the NSA "listens" with automated systems on all
phone calls, but they are looking for "keywords" which might indicate
terrorism. They would not be arresting you and using those calls against
you in court, though. They'd be calling you a terrorist and sending you
to Gitmo.
