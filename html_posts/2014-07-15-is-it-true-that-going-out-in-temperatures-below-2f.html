**Content:** [The thymus gland is not in the throat. It is in the chest
cavity. While it is possible for an enlarged thymus to cause breathing
problems, it is highly unlikely that the people in the \"medical news\"
articles from 1926 actually died from acute thymus swelling. They most
likely died from something else that was unknown to medical science at
the time.]{.rendered_qtext}
