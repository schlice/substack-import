<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The thymus gland is not in the throat. It is in the chest<br>cavity. While it is possible for an enlarged thymus to cause breathing<br>problems, it is highly unlikely that the people in the \"medical news\"<br>articles from 1926 actually died from acute thymus swelling. They most<br>likely died from something else that was unknown to medical science at<br>the time.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
