**Can I give my car to my friend in the United States for a few months
and ask him to take the insurance on my car for a few months? Is it
legal? I am not getting any cash in return.**

What would probably work better is to ask your friend to reimburse you
for your insurance during the time that he's borrowing your car.

Also, I'd get the whole thing in writing. Find a generic auto lease
agreement online and fill it out. Make sure it specifies the terms, like
when he's going to give it back (or when you need to re-do the
agreement) and whether or not he's going to reimburse you for insurance.

Believe me, it's better to cause the minor inconvenience up front by
signing a lease agreement than the major headache down the road when
confusion over the exact terms of the agreement causes major problems
(like he leaves the state with your car and doesn't come back for three
years). You say it will never happen, but it happens every day. Just get
it in writing. Save yourself the headache.
