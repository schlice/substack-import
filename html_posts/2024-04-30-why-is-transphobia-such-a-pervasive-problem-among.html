The answers here have covered the issue of the perception of
transphobia, since that is the real thrust of the question. But most of
our answerers here glossed over the last part where the questioner says
that Jesus tells us to not judge.

I want to take a moment to address this, as it is a *very* common
misinterpretation of the Bible. Many people use this verse in an attempt
to silence their critics, interpreting Jesus' meaning as "You don't have
the right to tell me I'm wrong." Taken in isolation, Jesus' command "Do
not judge" does indeed seem to preclude all negative assessments.
However, there is much more to the passage than those three words.

Christians are often accused of "judging" when we point out sin, but
doing so is not wrong. When you point out what is true and right, it
naturally defines what is *not* true and right, and the attacks start to
come from those who have chosen what is not right. But the simple fact
is that the right thing is always the right thing, regardless of how
many people have chosen the wrong thing.

Let's dig in to that concept of biblical judgement. My friends over at
[[GotQuestions.org](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c2491a&url=http://gotquestions.org){.external_link

qt-tooltip="gotquestions.org"}]{.qlink_container} have a really great
write-up on what Jesus meant when he said not to judge:

> The command to not judge others does not mean we cannot show
> discernment. Immediately after Jesus says, "Do not judge," He says,
> "Do not give dogs what is sacred; do not throw your pearls to pigs"

> "Watch out for false prophets. \[...\] By their fruit you will
> recognize them" (verses 15--16). How are we to determine who are the
> "dogs" and "pigs" and "false prophets" unless we have the ability to

> us permission to judge.
>
> Also, the Bible's command that we not judge others does not mean that
> all actions possess equal moral weight or that truth is subjective.
> The Bible clearly teaches that truth is objective, eternal, and

>
> Additionally, the Bible\'s instruction not to judge others does not
