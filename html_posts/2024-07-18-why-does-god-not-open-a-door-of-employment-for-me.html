I am sorry but no one is going to be able to answer that question for
you. There are many reasons why God may not answer your prayers in the
way you want. Perhaps you are not ready for what He has planned for you.
You may need to grow more before you are ready for what you're asking
for. Perhaps He is not ready (in other words, it's not in His timing
yet). Or perhaps it's not part of His good plan for you.

We do know that He has never not kept one of His promises, ever. If He
has promised something, He has kept that promise.

And He has promised that He has good plans for you.

> 29:11 ESV)

As Christians, we were never promised an easy life. But God does promise
us a ***glorious eternity.***

So maybe instead of praying for God to open a door when clearly He is
not, perhaps we should pray for Him to reveal His plans for us, and to
bring us alongside Him in those plans. His will **will** be done whether
we like it or not, so isn't it better that we just learn His plans for
us, and we help in accomplishing those plans?
