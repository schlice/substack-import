**Content:** [While I\'m not big on doing your Econ homework for you,
since the answer is so blatantly posted in Wikipedia, it\'s a silly
homework question anyway, so shame on your teacher for making you answer
it.\
\
From Wikipedia, here are three commodities which do not follow the law
of supply and demand:\

> **Giffen goods**\
> Initially proposed by Sir Robert Giffen, economists disagree on the
> existence of Giffen goods in the market. A Giffen good describes an
> inferior good that as the price increases, demand for the product
> increases. As an example, during the [[Irish Potato
> Famine](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=78e543&url=http://javascript:void(0)){.external_link

> century, potatoes were considered a Giffen good. Potatoes were the
> largest staple in the Irish diet, so as the price rose it had a large
> impact on income. People responded by cutting out luxury goods such as
> meat and vegetables, and instead bought more potatoes. Therefore, as
> the price of potatoes increased, so did the quantity demanded.\
> \
> **Expectation of change in the price of commodity**\
> If an increase in the price of a commodity causes households to expect
> the price of a commodity to increase further, they may start
> purchasing a greater amount of the commodity even at the presently
> increased price. Similarly, if the household expects the price of the
> commodity to decrease, it may postpone its purchases. Thus, some argue
> that the law of demand is violated in such cases. In this case, the
> demand curve does not slope down from left to right; instead it
> presents a backward slope from the top right to down left. This curve
> is known as an exceptional demand curve. When people feared that the
> government was going to enact bans on ammunition, the price, and the
> demand, similarly increased.\

> **Basic or necessary goods**\
> The goods which people need no matter how high the price is are basic
> or necessary goods. Medicines covered by insurance are a good example.
> An increase or decrease in the price of such a good does not affect
> its quantity demanded.
