**Is there any data on people who are admitted to US service academies
but never graduate?**

Each individual service academy keeps that information themselves, and
it is sorted by class year. You would have to approach each service
academy separately to retrieve this information. As far as I know, there
is no global repository for this data from all service academies.

The number of people who are admitted and leave before graduation is
sorted based on reason for leaving. Some leave because they become
medically disqualified for military service while they are there. Some
withdraw by choice. Some are ejected due to some policy or rule
violation. Some academically fail out.

You'll note, however, that those who do not meet athletic standards can
still graduate and receive their Bachelor's degree, but cannot be
commissioned as officers. They are required to repay their service
commitment in the enlisted ranks. I had at least one classmate who fell
into this category.
