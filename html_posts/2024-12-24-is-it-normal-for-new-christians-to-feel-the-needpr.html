Maybe not so much a need, or pressure, but *desire.*

Yes, you will likely *desire* to spread the Gospel! If you've just
learned about something so wonderful that you can hardly contain it,
wouldn't you literally want to share that with every single person you
meet?

Alas, reality hits hard. You realize that while you've found the Good
News, Satan is still ruler over this world. He has his claws into many
people, and he has control of much of the media and entertainment
industries. Your Good News won't be so warmly welcomed out there in the
great big world.

But take heart, because while the world will give you trouble, Jesus has
overcome the world (John 16:33).

My advice: live in such a way that people will want to know why you are
so happy all the time, even when times are tough. When you explain that
you have *hope*, you can then tell them *why*.

If you, as a new Christian, want a compelling way to share the Gospel, I
think that's a pretty good option.
