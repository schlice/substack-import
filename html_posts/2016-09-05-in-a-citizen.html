Let's review the statute first:

*A private person may arrest another:*

*1. For a public offense committed or attempted in his presence.*

*2. When the person arrested has committed a felony although not in his
presence.*

*3. When a felony has been in fact committed, and he has reasonable
cause for believing the person arrested to have committed it.*

Well, the first clause is pretty easy: the offense was committed or
attempted in his presence. The third clause is also fairly
straightforward, and it does oddly apply the "reasonable cause"
provision which is also applied to law enforcement nationwide.

The second clause is a bit trickier. It says "when the person arrested
has committed a felony". There doesn't appear to be any supposition in
this clause as there is in the third clause, which applies the
reasonable cause standard.

It appears that the second and third clauses differ in this way:

In clause 2, in one way or another, we are positive that this person
committed this felony, but we didn't see it. There is no doubt
whatsoever. How, exactly, a "private person" could encounter such a
circumstance, I do not know. How you can be so positive that someone
could have committed a felony that you did not see is beyond me, and
seems to be a clause just waiting for some hapless citizen to try to use
as justification for citizen's arrest, only to be shredded by defense
counsel.

In clause 3, we know a felony has been committed. We have reasonable
cause to believe that the arrested person committed it. We may not be
positive, but we do meet the standard of reasonable belief. In other
words, a "reasonable person" would believe that this person committed
this felony. This clause would likely be favored far more than clause 2
as it only requires the "reasonable person" standard, not the absolute
standard required in clause 2.

*Would the proper construction of this merely mean one must have
probable cause, as within the orthodox treatment of criminal law in
general, or does this require that the state actually proceed on a
felony charge, and /or require the defendant must be convicted at
trial?*

There is nothing **in the statute** that requires the defendant be
convicted in order to meet the statutory requirements listed. *That
said,* if the district attorney decides not to press charges, it would
have to be determined whether or not that decision stems from the fact
that he believes the arrestor did or did not meet the burden of proof
listed in the statute. If he is not pressing charges because he believes
the statutory requirements for arrest were not met, this sets the
arrestor up to be charged with false arrest.

*Notably, the latter constructions would't seem to make sense, given the
fact that prosecutors may be politically motivated for not filing a
charge, and a conviction is largely based upon prosecutorial
performance, and given the fact that juries may acquit the defendant for
any line of reason they choose (i.e. jury nullification.)*

You've put the cart before the horse. We're talking about the statute
for legally placing a person under citizen's arrest. Even the police
arrest people whom prosecutors choose to "not charge" and whom then are
released. What the district attorney's office chooses to do is up to
them. This statute is clearly structured to give legal abilities for
private citizens to effect an arrest when certain circumstances are
present.

That said, I'd never trust a statute to fully protect me unless that was
its design. For example, the Good Samaritan laws in effect in most
states protect persons who stop to help at the scene of an accident. The
specifics differ by state, but in most cases, if reasonable care was
taken, even if the volunteer injures the victim further, he is
indemnified against lawsuits, both civil and criminal. These laws are,
in fact, designed to encourage volunteers to assist, as sometimes the
difference between life and death is starting CPR that much sooner
before the ambulance arrives. However, even these laws are not
foolproof, and victims who are saddled with massive bills for ambulances
and doctors will try to extract payment from any place they can. I
wouldn't put it past them to try to sue, even in the face of Good
Samaritan laws. Nothing personal, just business.

This law is not designed to indemnify the arrestor against lawsuit. It
is designed to provide a legal framework under which a person can effect
a citizen's arrest. Bottom line: I wouldn't do it. In today's litigious
society, the risk is far too great, and this law has more holes than a
sieve. Instead, you're much better served if you can ***be a good
witness.*** Remember or record anything and everything you see. Remember
the who/what/when/where/why/how, and report them to law enforcement as
soon as you can safely do so. Everyone has a phone, 95% of those have
cameras. Take pictures or record video.
