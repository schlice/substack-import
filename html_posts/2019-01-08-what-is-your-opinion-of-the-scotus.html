**What is your opinion of the SCOTUS' 2nd Amendment ruling that the
phrase regarding \"well-regulated militia\" can essentially be ignored
as it relates to individual gun ownership?**

I think "ignored" is the wrong word to use when it comes to the
prefatory clause.

The ruling in *DC v. Heller* clarified that the 2nd Amendment has two
parts:

- The first clause of the Second Amendment that references a "militia"
  is a ***prefatory clause***.

> *A well-regulated Militia, being essential to the security of a free
> State*

The prefatory clause explains part of the reason we have the Amendment
in the first place, *but it does not limit the operative clause of the
Amendment*. Additionally, the term "militia" should not be read to limit
gun ownership to those serving in the military, because at the time the
term "militia" referred to all able-bodied men who were capable of being
called to such service.

- The second clause of the Second Amendment is known as the *operative
  clause.*

> *The right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be
> infringed.*

The phrase "the right of the people" is used three times in the Bill of
Rights, and each time it denotes a right reserved to individual citizens
by virtue of their citizenship, not because of membership in a
particular group (other than the group of citizens).

**TL;DR:** So to answer your question specifically, we don't "ignore"
the prefatory clause. However, the prefatory clause does not limit the
operative clause.
