I searched all over and I can't seem to find a place where you can get a
free paperback copy.

With the availability of electronic copies, and electronic copies in PDF
form which can be printed yourself, I'm not sure that you're going to
find someone to print you a copy for free.

But there are copies for *cheap*. Amazon will sell you a printed copy
for \$3:

[[https://www.amazon.com/Universal\...](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a0469a&url=https://www.amazon.com/Universal-Declaration-Rights-Nations-Publications/dp/921101364X){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}

But instead, I'd suggest finding someone who owns a printer and having
them print out the PDF for you. The paperback is only 14 pages.
