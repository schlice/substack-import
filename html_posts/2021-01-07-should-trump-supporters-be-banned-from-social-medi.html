**Should Trump supporters be banned from social media and financial
platforms once Biden is in the Oval Office?**

Yes!

Social media companies should ban anyone they choose from their
platforms.

However, they should not then be afforded safe harbor protections under
Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The law allows for online
platforms to voluntarily take actions "in good faith" to moderate
content.

**Let's be clear: censoring political views which you don't agree with
is not good-faith moderation.**

To that end, doing so causes you to lose your protection as a neutral
platform. By acting unilaterally to curate content, you become a
*content publisher*, and not just an open online platform. This means
you lose immunity from liability for what your users post.

And you can be sued for it. If Yelp or TripAdvisor ban Trump supporters
and lose Section 230 protection, they could be sued for the content of
users who post bad reviews about restaurants or hotels. If Facebook or
Twitter ban Trump supporters and subsequently lose protections under
Section 230, they could be sued for libel for allowing content which
causes harm to anyone.

It would be the death of those platforms. But maybe, if public opinion
supports this sort of banning, maybe it's time for them to die. Maybe
they should die in favor of something else.

So by all means, determine which people are "suitable" to post on your
platform.

But be prepared for the consequences.

*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.
Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a
civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not
misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously, and I have no tolerance
for harassing or inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough
shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion
masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your
own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site.
If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\"
don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything
vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be followed by a
block/mute, and a BNBR report. I will do this immediately and with no
compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*
