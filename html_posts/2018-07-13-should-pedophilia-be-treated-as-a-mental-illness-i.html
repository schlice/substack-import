**Should pedophilia be treated as a mental illness instead of a crime?**

I hate to break it to you, but pedophilia is not a crime. It is not
illegal to sexually desire a child. It is a mental disorder (called
pedophilic disorder) in which the patient has sexual attractions to
children who have not yet reached puberty.

There are crimes which pedophiles may commit. In California, such crimes
could be **Lewd Acts with a Child**, **Oral Copulation with a Minor**,
and other **Child Pornography** offenses, such as distributing or
possessing child pornography. The actual crimes vary by state, but all
states have one variation or another of these crimes.

You're getting the mental illness and the crime confused. Pedophilia is
the mental disorder which leads the patient to commit various and sundry
sex crimes against a child, and not a single one of those crimes is
called "pedophilia."
