The S7 has the following radios:

- GSM: 850/900/1800/1900 MHz frequencies
- 2G network: GSM 850/900/1800/1900
- 3G network: UMTS 850/1700/1900/2100
- 4G network: LTE Cat9 700/800/850/1700/1800/1900/2100/2600 (Bands
  1,2,3,4,5,7,12,13,20)
- Data networks: GPRS, EDGE, UMTS, HSDPA, HSUPA, HSPA+, LTE, LTE-A

I think you will find this table rather enlightening:

[[Samsung SM-G930T Galaxy S7 LTE-A (Samsung Hero) Compatibility in
United
States](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=fdbf32&url=https://www.frequencycheck.com/compatibility/Zyv2FDb/samsung-sm-g930t-galaxy-s7-lte-a-samsung-hero/united-states){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="frequencycheck.com"}]{.qlink_container}

That link shows you compatibility of the G930T in the United States. You
can back up one page and see network compatibility worldwide.

Hope this helps.
