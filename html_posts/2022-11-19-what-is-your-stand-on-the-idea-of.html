This is a particular pet peeve of mine, especially when people started
saying things like, "I'm speaking my truth."

No, you're not.

You may be speaking *your belief about the truth*, but you are not
speaking "your truth" as if truth is somehow different for you than it
is for me.

Let's review some truths about truth:

1.  Truth is *discovered*, not *invented*. Gravity existed before the
    apple fell on Newton's head.
2.  Truth is transcultural and universal. It is true for all people for
    all times and in all places that 2+2=4.
3.  Truth is unchanging, even though our *beliefs* about truth may
    change. When people started believing that the earth was round
    instead of flat, the *truth* about the earth didn't change. Only our
    *belief* about the earth changed.
4.  Belief cannot change the truth, no matter how sincere your belief
    is. Even if you sincerely believe that the earth is flat, this only
    makes you sincerely wrong.
5.  The attitude of the person doesn't change the truth either. Just
    because someone speaks the truth with arrogance doesn't make it
    false, and a humble man doesn't make his error any more true.
6.  All truths are absolute truths. Even if I say, "I am cold today,"
    that is an absolute truth, because for all people in all places at
    all times, it is true that I am cold.

Contrary *beliefs* are possible, but contrary *truths* are not. We can
*believe* anything is true, but that doesn't *make* them true.
