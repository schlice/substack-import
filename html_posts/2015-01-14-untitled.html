<h2>Answer Comment</h2>
<div>

**Content:** [Have you not read the Constitution?\
\
\"\...the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be
infringed.\"\
\
There is no \"off-limits\" for civilians using firearms. Your arguments
are not relevant, since all of the things you quoted are privileges, not
rights. Car ownership is not regulated; *driving* a car on public roads
is a heavily-regulated privilege granted by the state. Even with all
that regulation, cars still kill more people than guns. Interesting\...\
\
Since gun ownership is a protected right, it cannot be similarly
restricted.\
\
Also, in order to *conceal* a firearm, you have to get training. Note
that open carry does not require any licensing at all.\
\
You\'ll be comforted to know that your over-confident friend, if he
lives in an open-carry area, decides to open-carry without any training,
he probably won\'t have time to use his weapon, as he\'ll be one of the
first targets.]{.rendered_qtext}
