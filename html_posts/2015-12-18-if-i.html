You know yourself, that\'s a good thing.

The military is, in my opinion, a great career option. You learn
valuable life skills, generally have marketable skills should you choose
to get out (or you have to get out for one reason or another), you have
educational opportunities and opportunities for personal growth. And,
not the least of which, you will be serving your country and will join a
long line of brave Americans who wore that same uniform before you did.
When you do get out, you will be a veteran. You will always be a
veteran; no one can ever take that away from you.

Here\'s another interesting tidbit about today\'s military: as an NCO
(Non-Commissioned Officer, or enlisted member), you will be *expected*
to earn your degree. To be fair, it\'s not a written requirement, but if
you want to advance to senior NCO ranks, you will be expected to earn a
degree (at least an Associate\'s degree, if not a Bachelor\'s degree).

The military is not a bunch of brainless rifle operators as many people
envision. Today\'s military is intelligent, motivated, and fiercely
loyal to this nation and the foundations on which it was built. You will
never find a more highly motivated, truly dedicated, hard-charging team
of professionals anywhere in the world.
