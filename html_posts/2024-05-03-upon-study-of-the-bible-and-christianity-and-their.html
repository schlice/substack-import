So that we're all on the same page, perhaps you'd be willing to share
this "clear evidence" that the "religion" has been changed, and that
many of its beliefs are "sinful" as opposed to "original Christianity."

Where is this record of "original Christianity?" Can you show the
original documents and the changes that were made, clearly showing
intentional alteration?

I would be very interested to see this "clear evidence" you speak of.
