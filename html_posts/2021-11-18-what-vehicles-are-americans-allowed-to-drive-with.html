First of all, every state is different, and the specifics about what is
covered under each state's specific driver's licenses varies from state
to state.

However, most non-commercial driver's licenses are valid for passenger
vehicles up to 15 passengers (including the driver) with Gross Vehicle
Weight Rating (GVWR) of 26,000 pounds (11,793 kg) or less, which would
include most cars, trucks, and RVs, as well as two or three-wheeled
motor vehicles with smaller than 50cc engines (like mopeds or small
scooters).

If you want to drive anything larger, or anything that holds more than
15 passengers, you will need an *endorsement* on your license. This
usually involves a separate test (possibly a driving test as well), and
a separate fee for each endorsement.
