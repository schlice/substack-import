Could it? Sure. Is it likely? Probably not.

[[A
study](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=790062&url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25961060){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="nih.gov"}]{.qlink_container} published at the National
Institute of Health found that "garlic appears to enhance the
functioning of the immune system by stimulating certain cell types, such
as macrophages, lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells,
and eosinophils, by mechanisms including modulation of cytokine
secretion, immunoglobulin production, phagocytosis, and macrophage
activation."[\[1\]](#xTuZe){#cite-xTuZe .citation_link} So is it
possible that a simple stimulation of white blood cells could cause
increased disease activity? Sure, it's possible.

However, at the same time, garlic also modulates the secretion of
cytokines, which regulate the immune system. which could contribute to
the regulation and/or treatment of many diseases, such as "obesity,
metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disorders, gastric ulcer, and even
cancer."[\[2\]](#kkzfO){#cite-kkzfO .citation_link} Cytokine modulation
may be critical, as there is evidence of increased cytokine activation
during MS relapse.[\[3\]](#VYFYy){#cite-VYFYy .citation_link} So garlic
may also *regulate* improper immune system function.

Garlic, therefore, could make things worse by increasing white blood
cell activity, but it could also make things better by modulating
cytokines.

No one has yet studied this in humans, to the best of my knowledge.

So what should you do? Should you start pounding the garlic because you
have MS?

**Absolutely not**. This is all "bleeding-edge" medicine. There is no
consensus yet regarding this issue. It's only been studied, on paper,
using mouse models of a disease which mimics MS. Changing things now is
not only not indicated, but without further study, it could be harmful.

If you think that garlic might help you, talk to your neurologist and
your nutritionist. Let them work together to decide what will be best to
treat your disease.
