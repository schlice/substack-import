It's because there is a difference between loving someone and accepting
their behavior.

Christians do love everyone. Yes, even LGBTQ people. However, and this
part is important, **we are under no obligation to condone sinful**
***behavior*.** God does not approve of sinful behavior, and neither do
I.

Note that the only thing we do not have to condone (that means: approve
of) is ***sinful behavior***. Not condoning sinful behavior **has zero
impact** on whether or not I love my brother or sister. And this truth
does not just apply to the LGBTQ community. It applies to *anyone*. It
doesn't matter what the sin is. I don't have to condone the sin

"Love the sinner, hate the sin." Or better, "Hate the sin, ***because***
you love the sinner." Sin is contrary to our good, so if I am to love
everyone, then I want what's good for them. Therefore, I should hate
whatever is contrary to their good, and sin is contrary to their good.

The hard truth is: **no person should try to force anyone else to
condone their sinful behavior, either**. Again, doesn't matter what the
sin is. It is up to the *sinner* to repent; it is not up to the others
around the sinner to accept their sinful behavior as valid. Doesn't
matter what the sin is. We could easily substitute adulterers, thieves,
murderers, or those caught in the vice of sexual immorality of any kind,
into this bucket. It certainly isn't limited to the sins which are
committed within the LGBTQ community.

Yes, it is true that some Christians do not understand that difference,
and they fail to love their neighbor as we are commanded to do. That
doesn't change the fact that the difference exists.

It is now up to you to discover the difference, too. Remember, the truth
is still the truth, regardless of our belief about the truth. Our belief
doesn't change the truth. And it doesn't matter how sincerely we believe
it. If I believe the earth is flat, but I really sincerely believe it,
it doesn't change the shape of the earth, it just makes me sincerely
mistaken.
