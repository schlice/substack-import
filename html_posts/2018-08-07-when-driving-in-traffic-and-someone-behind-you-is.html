**When driving in traffic and someone behind you is following closely,
like they are in your trunk, what is your reaction?**

The correct answer is to increase the distance between you and the car
in front of you. This gives you more reaction time to slow down
gradually should traffic in front of you come to a rapid stop. If you
fail to leave extra space in front of you, you may end up having to
brake hard, and the guy behind you is very likely going to end up
actually in your trunk.

The douche-y answer is to slow down to exactly the speed limit, or maybe
five miles an hour or so under the speed limit. Nothing says I have to
do the speed limit, and if I'm not being a hazard, oh well. I've had
angry drivers go on to the shoulder to get around me when I do that.
