Indeed, this is a valid question. I mean, abortion is legal, but not
everyone agrees that it's right. Polygamy is illegal, but some people
believe that it should be legal.

We live in a nation of *laws*. Laws are basically designed so that while
*you* exercise your freedoms, you don't negatively impact anyone else
who is exercising their own freedoms.

Let's just take one example: abortion. How does abortion negatively
impact anyone else's rights? It most definitely impact's the baby's
rights, doesn't it? So how is this disagreement handled? The courts had
to determine whether or not the law allowing abortion violated the
baby's rights. Essentially, what they came up with (and this is a *very*
basic summary) is that the baby *has no rights* because it's not a
"person" for the definition of person in the Constitution until it is
*born*. Before that, it's a "fetus" and is not subject to the
protections granted to "persons" in the Constitution.

So in general, how this works:

- A law is written.
- Someone disagrees with the law, **and** argues that the law violates
  one of their Constitutional rights.
- The court decides whether or not the law actually violates their
  Constitutional rights. If it does, the law is stricken. If it does
  not, the law stands.

People can certainly have differences of opinion. You can argue that
polygamy doesn't hurt anyone, and you should be able to take more than
one wife or a woman should be able to take more than one husband. Good,
honest people can disagree in this way.

However, people also understand that in order to live *harmoniously*
with other people, we all have to *agree* on what laws we are to live
by. We all understand that we have to *cede* a small amount of our
autonomy to do *whatever we want* so that we can all live together
without negatively impacting each other.

As a citizen in a society, we all agree to follow the law (despite our
personal preferences) so that a civil society will follow. We can always
attempt to change the law (legally, of course), but until the day when
the law is changed, we agree to follow that law. It's foundational to
being a member of a civil, law-abiding society.
