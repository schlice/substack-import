While your picture is incorrect, grooved pavement was something that was
[[invented by NASA in the
50s](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1255f6&url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/factsheets/Groove.html){.external_link

grooves into road surfaces will funnel excess water away from the road
surface where aircraft and spacecraft landing tires make contact with
the runway, and would reduce hydroplaning, and thus reduce accidents
where aircraft slide off the end of the runway in rainy weather.

In the 60s, the technology started to make its way onto commercial
runways instead of just NASA runways. The airline industry noted that
aircraft tire friction performance had increased 200 to 300 percent when
using grooved pavement.

In the late 60s, the technology started to make its way to highways. In
California, wet road accident frequency was reduced by 98 percent in
some road sections.

The question related specifically to wear on vehicle tires. Since there
is less tire surface impacting the road on a grooved surface, tires
should wear less (albeit by a very small amount) as they drive over a
grooved surface. Even if grooved road surfaces caused wear to increase
(at a small rate, but increase over non-grooved surfaces), the benefits
in improving traction and preventing hydroplaning and accidents in wet
weather far outweigh any wear issues which would be caused.
