As always, the devil is in the details.

She didn't call him a weak man for taking paternity leave.

She said specifically this:

She is criticizing the fact that he took leave **during a national
transportation crisis.**

Considering that Ted Cruz [[was criticized for taking a vacation with
his
family](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7e583f&url=https://www.usatoday.com./story/news/politics/2021/02/18/sen-ted-cruz-flew-mexico-vacation-amid-texas-winter-storm/6798518002/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"

qt-tooltip="usatoday.com"}]{.qlink_container} while Texas was going
through its energy crisis over the winter, I think it's only fair that
Mayor Pete is criticized for taking personal time during a crisis which
is arguably overseen by his organization, considering he is the
Secretary of Transportation.

It's not about Mayor Pete taking paternity leave. It's about taking
personal time **during a crisis** which is his responsibility to
oversee.

Original question:

What do you think of Candace Owens calling Pete Buttigieg a \"weak man\"
for taking time off to be with his new born twins? Did Owens consider
Buttigieg spent 6 years in the Navy reserve and was deployed to
Afghanistan?
