Yes. State appellate courts and State Supreme courts can rule on the
*constitutionality* of the law; i.e. determining whether or not the law
violates the constitution of the state. The Federal Circuit Courts and
the US Supreme Court does the same for Federal law.

District, city, and county courts do not rule on constitutionality of
law; they determine whether or not a person violated a particular law.
On appeal, the defendant can challenge the constitutionality of the law.
