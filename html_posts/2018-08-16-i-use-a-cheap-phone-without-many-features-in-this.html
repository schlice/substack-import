**I use a cheap phone without many features in this modern world of
technology. Is it clever to invest my money in the latest expensive
smart phone or should I invest in something productive?**

The answer, of course, is "it depends."

Whether or not you need the "many features" in the latest high-end
smartphone is entirely up to you.

So what are those features?

- Near professional-quality camera
- Bright display with very high resolution
- Long battery life
- Most modern, up-to-date operating system

Smartphones are miniature computers, and the high-end models are priced
almost as much as a laptop computer. Considering that you use the device
every day, usually many times per day, the cost is at least somewhat
justified.

People who use their smartphones as their *primary content delivery
device* will tend towards a higher end device. These people will be
doing ***nearly everything*** with their smartphones. This includes, but
is by no means limited to:

- Banking
- Health management
- Email / messaging
- Social
- Shopping
- Photography
- Music
- Mobile payments (NFC, MST \[for Samsung\])
- Consuming content (YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, etc)
- Two-factor authorization
- Work-related functions separate from the above

If this is the primary device you use to access this content on a
day-to-day basis, throughout the day, then a higher-end device may be
for you. You'll want to do all of those things in a snappy device which
multi-tasks as quickly as you do, and looks beautiful while doing it.

The extent to which you do those things (and many more) will determine
what type of phone you should get. Do you consume content on your
device, or do you have cable or satellite only? Do you use social media,
or do you only use SMS messaging with your friends? Do you spend more
time making voice calls than sending text messages?

You see, it is your usage which determines what kind of device you would
like to spend money on. And again, don't forget that you are literally
using the device every day, multiple times a day. Can you say the same
for your PC? Your TV? Your stereo equipment? Yet you have no problem
shelling out similar amounts of money for those devices and their
associated accouterments, and you don't use them *nearly* as much as you
use your phone. If you finance your phone and amortize the payments over
two years, you're usually paying about \$30 a month. You are paying
*literally \$1 a day* for a device that you use multiple times a day.
Whether or not that is worth it is up to you.

*Can you get by with a budget smartphone?* The answer to that question
is enirely up to you. If you can get by (and you don't feel limited by)
using a budget smartphone, then you should absolutely do so. If that
Tracfone flip phone works for you, then go for it.

But here's something else to consider: **a middle ground.** *Midrange*
smartphones have been improving in quality by leaps and bounds. For
*literally* half the price of a top-tier smartphone, you can get a
[[Huawei Mate 10
Pro](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=869ec0&url=https://smile.amazon.com/Huawei-Unlocked-Processor-Camera-Resistant/dp/B078T3D547){.external_link

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container} (it's only \$549, where the
Apple iPhone X is currently \$1000), and it's *really good*. Its specs
compare quite favorably to top-tier phones. I mean, it's got Leica
camera lenses built in, a dual camera setup on the back, fingerprint
sensor, all-screen mostly bezel-less front, and it's actually quite
snappy. Its quick-charge technology is actually the fastest in the
industry. It will charge its **4000 mAh** battery (biggest in the
industry in a consumer-grade device) in about 20 minutes.

There is plenty to consider here, but the choice is literally up to you.
