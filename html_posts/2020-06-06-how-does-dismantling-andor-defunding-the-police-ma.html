**How does dismantling and/or defunding the police make any sense?**

It doesn't. The people championing this position are either uninformed,
or are willfully anti-authority, of any kind. Maybe even a little bit of
both.

The way we change the behavior of police officers is the same way we
change the behavior of criminals. Remove the motive.

For example, if I'm a purse snatcher, and I work in an area where I have
a guaranteed force monopoly (i.e. people are not allowed to carry guns),
I can make a good living snatching purses and there's little chance I'm
going to face any resistance, armed or otherwise. Even if there's a 1 in
100 chance that I run into a woman who is a black belt in multiple forms
and she beats the snot out of me, for a 1 in 100 chance, I'm still
clearing a large, tax-free salary.

But what if I allow firearms and now 50% of purse-carrying women are
armed? Now there's a 50% chance that I'm going to grab a purse and
**die**. Now, it's no longer profitable to be a purse snatcher, so I
stop.

So what is it that makes it "profitable" for a racist cop to exist?
**Protection from prosecution**.

We have to revamp the doctrine of *qualified immunity*.

We have to make it so that we can disallow qualified immunity in
specific cases where it is clear that misconduct took place, either
willful or ignorant misconduct.

This is the time for the court to either severely revamp, or perhaps
eliminate, the doctrine of qualified immunity. The net effect of this
for police officers is that civil rights violation suits (which seems to
be the biggest issue today) would increase, and the focus of those
investigations would get back to what it is supposed to be about:
determining whether or not police officers exceeded their Constitutional
authority. But it wouldn't change Constitutional *protections*, it would
only allow courts to review these cases without being barred by
qualified immunity.

In essence, every action a police officer takes will have to be taken
knowing that he could face a civil rights case, and his defense had
better be spot on. Causing an officer to pause shouldn't have a chilling
effect on law enforcement, because it doesn't change Constitutional
protections at all. It only allows civil rights cases to move forward
instead of simply failing at pre-trial motions. It allows courts to do
what they are designed to do, and allows civil rights actions to be
properly adjudicated.

That's a good start.
