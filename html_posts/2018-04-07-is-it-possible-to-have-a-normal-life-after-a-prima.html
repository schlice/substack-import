**Is it possible to have a normal life after a primary progressive
multiple sclerosis diagnosis?**

Define "normal."

Once you do that, you can have a normal life, but it all depends on your
definition.

In all seriousness, your life is what you make it. If you define normal
outside of what your body can handle, you're going to be disappointed.
But if you realize that you will have to make a few changes in your life
because of MS, and you roll with the punches, you'll be just fine.

Remember, you have MS. MS doesn't have you.
