**What are the risks of carrying only personal liability car insurance
in the USA?**

If you don't carry collision coverage, any repairs which are not paid
for by someone else (in most states) are your responsibility. Simply
replacing a bumper costs several thousand dollars out of pocket. A
full-on collision could cost you the actual price of the car, meaning it
would cost you more to fix it than to just junk it and buy a new car.
This means that the entire investment in your vehicle is gone, and
anything you owe on it is still owed, and you're still out a car.

Additionally, in your state, you may not be allowed to carry only
personal liability insurance (also called Personal Injury Protection, or
PIP). Nearly all states require you to carry bodily injury coverage
(i.e. to cover injuries you cause). A handful of states allow you to put
up a bond in lieu of insurance (to prove you can pay for any injuries
you may cause). Also, you are required in nearly all states to have some
form of property damage liability insurance (to cover damage you cause
to the property of others).
