You stated that someone was charged with \"barring the course of
justice\" (otherwise known as \"obstruction of justice\") but this
person knew about a murder and intentionally deflected law enforcement.

This is very serious. How serious, you ask?

If someone knew about a murder, and specifically provided false
information so that attention was deflected from the actual murderer or
the false information was given specifically to derail the actual
investigation, this person could then be charged with the offense of
\"accessory after the fact.\" If you are an accessory to a crime, you
are generally charged **exactly as the actual suspect is charged**.

The charge of \"barring the course of justice\" is a lesser included
offense of the \"accessory after the fact\" charge.

If the person is indeed charged with obstruction, it is not as serious
as the greater charge of accessory after the fact, but it\'s still
likely to be considered felony obstruction (depending on jurisdiction,
since it\'s more egregious than something like failing to give your real
name), and will get that person a minimum of one year in prison. Other
punishments are specific to the jurisdiction (i.e. maximums and fines),
but a felony is a minimum of one year in prison.
