**Why is it that some people who get Multiple-sclerosis go down hill
rapidly and wind up in a wheel chair while others live for a long time
with relatively mild symptoms?**

The truth is that in actuality, we don't know. As you mentioned, some
people do very well with mild symptoms and some people "go downhill
rapidly."

However, it is also true that the vast majority of people with MS will
never be confined to a wheelchair. Most people with MS will have mild or
moderately-disruptive symptoms, treatable with medications or therapy,
and will generally live mostly-normal lives.
