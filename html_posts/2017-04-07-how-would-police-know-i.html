Regardless of whether or not the police somehow had information
indicating that you were a recovering addict (congratulations, by the
way, keep on fighting), being such does not remove any rights you have
under the Constitution.

There are a scant few scenarios in which you get rights removed.
Primarily: if you are accused of domestic violence in some states, you
have been adjudicated as a "mental deficient," you have been convicted
of a felony, or you are a parolee. There are probably a few others, but
I can't think of them off the top of my head. Basically, if you have had
your Constitutional rights curtailed, you would know it, because it
would have been a judge who told you about it.

Beyond that, being in rehab doesn't remove any Constitutional rights.
The police did not have the right to search your car. If this happened
recently, and the police found something in your car that they are
planning on using against you, I would suggest enlisting the services of
a civil rights attorney.

If they didn't find anything, just remember for next time: being an
***addict*** doesn't make you a ***criminal***. It makes you a
***patient***. You have a disease of the system in your brain which
controls choice. This is why you have to abstain from all drugs,
including alcohol. **It doesn't make you a bad person.** Know that.

have second-hand experience, so to speak)*
