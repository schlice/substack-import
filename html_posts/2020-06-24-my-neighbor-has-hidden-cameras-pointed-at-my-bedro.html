**My neighbor has hidden cameras pointed at my bedroom windows and
backyard and front yard. I can't see them but I feel I am being watched.
What can I do? I feel violated. What legal actions can I take?**

I'm going to sidestep the paranoia angle. I agree, I just feel like
everyone else has covered it.

But hey, it's not my place to fail to answer your question simply
because you asked it out of paranoia.

Here's the best thing you can do to stop them: install one of these bad
boys in your bedroom window.

*(Note that this is just an option of an IR floodlight that I found on
Amazon for a reasonable price; you can use any IR floodlight to solve
the problem)*

This floodlight does not produce visible light. It produces *infrared*
illumination. So for a solid 200 feet around this unit, the dark of
night will look like daylight to a camera.

And for any cameras pointed *at this unit*, it will look like they are
staring into the sun.

Complete privacy, no visible light. Congratulations, you've just
defeated the most common types of cameras which might be used to look in
to that window.
