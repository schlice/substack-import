Your relationship with your care team is vital. You want a neurologist
who will listen to your concerns and work with you, as a team. If this
does not describe your relationship with your neurologist, it's time to
shop around.

[[Fatigue](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4c2dce&url=http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Symptoms-Diagnosis/MS-Symptoms/Fatigue){.external_link

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"

most common symptoms of MS. One type of MS fatigue even has its own
name: *MS Lassitude*. It's estimated that over 80% of people with MS
have experienced this symptom at some point, some more severely than
others. I certainly know I have, but not all the time. When I push
myself in the heat, it kicks my butt at the end of the day. I've
literally fallen asleep in my clothes because I was so drained. I had to
have my wife drive us home one night after a particularly exhausting day
in the heat. I sat in the seat and instantly realized that there was no
way I was going to be able to safely drive home. It's a learning
process; you learn how hard you can push yourself, and you learn what
the consequences are to doing so.

Sorry that I don't have SSDI experience, but [[your local MS Society
