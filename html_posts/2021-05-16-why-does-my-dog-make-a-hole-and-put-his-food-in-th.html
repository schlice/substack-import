**Why does my dog make a hole and put his food in there then dig is
closed? She usually does that with bread or bones.**

When dogs in the wild kill an animal, they will often bury the leftovers
to come back to at a later time. This way, they won't go hungry if they
don't have a fresh kill.

When domesticated dogs display the same behavior, it could be for a
number of reasons:

1.  You may be **overfeeding** your dog. If it doesn't want to eat the
    food it has, it may bury it for later.
2.  Sometimes, dogs will mimic this behavior with toys. If it has too
    many toys, it may play with them by burying them to save for later.
3.  When the items are not necessarily related directly to the dog, and
    maybe more to you (like the TV remote or your cell phone), the dog
    may be trying to encourage you to play by burying items it perceives
    are important to you.
4.  Sometimes, dogs bury food because they don't feel comfortable in
    their environment, or because they feel stressed. The act of digging
    calms the dog down, and burying food gives them a feeling that they
    can eat in peace at some time later.

If a dog does this too much, the stress of managing all of the stashes
can actually make the dog ***more*** stressed than before, which just
makes the problem worse.

If your dog is stress-burying, make sure that the environment that the
dog is eating in is less stressful. It should be able to eat without
being disturbed. Ideally, your dog should eat even with you being
present, without feeling stressed.

And if your dog is burying its excess food, the answer is simple: don't
overfeed your dog! Talk to your vet about appropriate portion sizes, or
maybe limiting the number of times per day you feed your dog (i.e. cut
it down from three to two).
