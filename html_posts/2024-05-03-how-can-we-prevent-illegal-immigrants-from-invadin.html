1.  Do not elect Democrats. Democrats want more illegal immigrants, and
    then they want to give those same illegal immigrants voting status
    (with a wink-wink nod-nod reminder as to which party is their Santa
    Claus).
2.  But in addition to that, live in a state with a strong Castle
    Doctrine, and then defend your home with force. Pinpoint accurate,
    high-velocity force. Pew Pew!
