First of all, the answer to any legal question is "it depends."

Secondly, in the vast, vast majority of cases, there is never "proof"
that a man is the father of a child. Paternity tests are not mandatory
when a woman has a child. For example, when a man and a woman are
married, there is a *presumption* that the man is the father of the
woman's child. The paternity test is the *exception*, not the *rule.*

Child support is handled on a state-by-state level. And in nearly all
states, **a non biological parent can indeed be ordered by a court to
pay child support.**

Since I'm in Florida, I'll use that as the example. There are different
legal definitions of fathers in the state of Florida (and in many other
states as well). They are:

- Presumptive Father: A presumption of fatherhood is established if a
  minor child is born during the marriage.
- Putative Father: A unmarried man who claims to be the biological
  father of a minor child, or the mother claims that he is the
  biological father.
- Prospective Father: If the man was living with the mother at the time
  of conception, was married to the mother at the time of conception, is
  identified on the birth certificate as the father, or is named in an
  application for government assistance as the father.

The type of father you are determines the conditions under which you
have to pay child support in Florida.

- Presumptive fathers will be ordered to pay child support and will
  receive visitation.
- Putative and prospective fathers will be ordered to pay child support
  and will not receive visitation. To get visitation, the father must
  file a Petition To Determine Paternity and Related Relief. But by
  doing so, you submit yourself to the courts and admit that you are the
  father.

If you don't want to pay child support because you are not any of the
above fathers, you must prove this by filing a Petition To Disestablish
Paternity. There are some conditions to the filing of that petition;
your attorney can help you with that.
