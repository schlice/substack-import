You're a married Christian. The end.

If you are a ***true*** Christian, you already know that marriage is
forever.

You may *want* to marry a Hindu, but you are married already, and that's
forever.

So I can help you. Recommit yourself to your current spouse. Do a
marriage retreat. Take a vacation with just your spouse. Reconnect with
that person.

And finally, remember that **you made a vow**. How well people should
trust you is rightly dependent on how well you keep your promises. Be
the kind of person who people would want to trust.
