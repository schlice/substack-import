**What is the difference between rooting your smartphone and rooting a
tablet and why is rooting a tablet illegal?**

There is no functional difference between rooting a phone and rooting a
tablet.

Neither one is illegal.

However, rooting your device will void any manufacturer's warranty that
your phone may still be covered under. Word to the wise: don't root your
phone while it still is within the manufacturer's warranty period.
Additionally, some software will stop working when a phone is rooted.
For example, Samsung KNOX will no longer function when the phone is
rooted. This is because rooting the phone requires a custom bootloader,
and flashing the bootloader will trip the e-fuse in the phone. Yes, it's
a physical fuse. And once it's tripped, it will never work again; it
cannot be reset. KNOX functionality requires an intact e-fuse. Several
things rely on KNOX, including Samsung Pay, and encrypted "work"
profiles (if your company uses that functionality).

Nevertheless, to answer your specific question, there is really no
functional difference between rooting a phone and a tablet, and neither
is illegal. However, it may affect supportability and warranties, so
root with care and be sure you fully understand the consequences of
rooting.
