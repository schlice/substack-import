Let's not be hyperbolic about this ourselves, okay?

We're not talking about **all travel**. We're talking about
*state-funded official* travel.

And it's not "three states," it's "three **more** states": in July 2023,
California added Missouri, Nebraska, and Wyoming to their list of states
to which official state travel is banned, bringing the total to **26**.

Think about that. California is self-imposing travel restrictions for
their own state officials to *more than half the country* because *they
do not agree with the laws that other states choose to pass.*

Can you not see the **dripping hypocrisy** here? California is free to
pass laws restricting official travel to 26 states (all of which are
equal under the Constitution), yet these states are not free to pass
whatever laws they choose in their states, presumably with the support
of the majority of that state's voting population? Whatever fuss
California is choosing to make over the laws of other states only hurts
California, not anyone else.

Oh well, their self-imposed isolation is just fine with the rest of the
United States. When has "I'm going to hold my breath until you give me
what I want" ever worked?

If you're in California and you're reading this: **move**, before it's
too late. Before they don't let you leave. More people are leaving
California than are leaving any other state in the country right
now.[\[1\]](#ROrmE){#cite-ROrmE .citation_link} Join them. Get out. Get
to a state which respects you and your freedom. And as an added bonus,
California has some of the highest prices for real estate, so if you
sell your house in California, you can get a *bigger house* on *more
land* in another state for the same amount of money. Win win!
