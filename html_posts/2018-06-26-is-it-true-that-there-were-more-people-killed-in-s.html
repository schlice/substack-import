**Is it true that there were more people killed in schools than in the
military this year in the U.S.? If true, this is a sad day indeed. I
understand why people are homeschooling more often!**

[[Politifact](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6e35b6&url=http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2018/may/21/gwen-graham/have-more-students-been-killed-schools-soldiers-co/){.external_link

found it to be **mostly true**.

However, let's break the little tidbit down.

The first half of 2018 has seen an *unusually high* number of students
killed in school shootings. The Politifact writers find that through May
18 of 2017, there were two deaths in school shootings. Through May 18 of
2016, it was one; for 2015 it was zero; and for 2014 it was one. So the
fact that through May 18 of 2018 there were **26** shows that there is
an *anomaly* in school shootings in the first part of 2018 as opposed to
previous years. The total number of military members killed in the two
active military operations currently ongoing is **13.**

Secondly, the death rate (or the likelihood of being killed in either a
school shooting or in the military) is more important than the actual
numbers in any snapshot at any given time. Considering that there are
approximately 50 million students in K-12 schools, and the military
members actively present in the two combat zones listed above is less
than 20,000, a military member is still ***40 times more likely*** to be
killed in a combat zone than a student is to be killed in a school
shooting.

The numbers game is the one that is similar to this: I can say that any
time a plane crashes, upwards of 200 people die. Any time a car crashes,
you could have as many as 10 people dead. So cars are objectively safer,
right? Only if you look at an individual car crash versus an individual
plane crash. You must look at the total number of people traveling by
air vs the total number of people traveling by car, and the number of
people killed on average each year in each one of those modes of
transportation. Once you do that, you find that air travel is
significantly safer than driving in a car.

So simple numbers, taken without any context, will not tell the whole
story. Let's be clear about something right now: **Yes, there were 26
children killed in school shootings, and that is an abomination.** But
to simply look at that number and extrapolate that *therefore, schools
are less safe than combat zones* is lazy statistics at best, and is
intentionally misleading at worst.
