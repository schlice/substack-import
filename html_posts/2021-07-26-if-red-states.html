They won't be asked. States which exceed their own capacity will do
exactly what they planned on doing in those instances. In fact, they
already have plans in place to handle any ICU overruns.

Since most people think of Florida, I can tell you that here in Florida,
we can expand our ICU capacity by at least double (or possibly triple)
if need be. This is all handled by the State Emergency Response Team
under the Division of Emergency Management. These plans were built out
long before the initial wave of COVID cases, long before 2020, and long
before treatment for these cases improved.

In other words, we'll create temporary ICUs out of everything from
auditoriums to sports arenas before we decide that the best course of
action is to leave the state.

We'll ask for federal emergency dollars to do it. So blue states will,
in essence, *contribute* to our disaster relief because money to the
federal government comes from everywhere. And that money is not
conditioned on whether or not you had a mask mandate in your state.

Original question:

If red states\' healthcare systems collapse under the explosion of new
Covid-19 delta cases (no mask/vaccine mandates), will neighboring blue
state hospitals accept patients from those states, and if so, why?
