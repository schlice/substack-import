it\'s an interesting question. What if the government conditioned your
ability to vote on whether or not you had received the vaccine?

Right away, I see a few problems.

- There are certain groups of people who simply cannot receive a
  vaccine. These people may have medical conditions that preclude them
  from getting vaccinated. Unless you have made some exception for these
  people, you instantly disenfranchised them, which is unconstitutional.
- Next, there are certain people with legitimate religious exemptions.
  You have just disenfranchised those voters as well, which is also
  unconstitutional.
- Finally, and this is a big one, at least 100 million people in the
  United States have already contracted COVID-19 and have recovered. And
  the jury is still out on whether or not it is medically advisable for
  somebody who already has COVID-19 antibodies to take the vaccine. The
  prevailing medical opinion is, "Well it can\'t hurt," but that\'s not
  necessarily true. From a medical standpoint, it\'s not really
  necessary for those people to get a vaccine, and there may be a higher
  risk of side effects in giving the vaccine to people who have already
  contracted COVID-19.
- And just as we do for every other vaccine in this country, we must
  have allowances for those people who have legitimate, science-based
  objections to this vaccine.

It just seems like this is yet another scheme to try to find a way to
"convince" people to get the vaccine against their will. Maybe if we can
condition it on something they really really want, maybe they\'ll go get
it. But in the vast majority of cases, the unvaccinated are not so
because they\'re obstinate. They are unvaccinated by choice.
Well-informed, science-based choice.
