1.  Make sure that the Dropbox app is installed. Easiest way to do this
    is to go to the Google Play store and search up Dropbox. Make sure
    it doesn\'t say \"Install.\" If it does, install it.
2.  Go to the video in Gallery.
3.  Click **Share.**
4.  Click **Add to Dropbox.**
5.  Pick a folder.
6.  Click **Add.**
7.  The video gets uploaded.

Please note that anyone using Dropbox on the web will only see the first
15 minutes of the video. Dropbox for Business users will see the full
video. Plus, anyone else using any other Dropbox app will see the full
video.
