This is an **excellent** question!

When we mandated the vaccine, we forced people to do something that only
benefited them, not anyone else. Sure, at a base level, getting
vaccinated may have contributed to fewer hospitalizations, so it may
have reduced some of the load on the hospitals, but by the time mass
vaccination was rolling out, hospitalizations were already on the
decline.

**So it only makes sense** to continue the logic. I mean, if we forced
people to do something for their own good *once*, why can't we *do it
again?*

There are **SOOOOOO MANY** areas in which we can force people to do the
most healthy things:

- A nationwide moratorium on all sugar, in all forms. Sorry baking
  community, but your stuff is unhealthy. Learn how to use natural
  products like fruit juices, stevia and honey to sweeten things.
  Processed sugar will go the way of the internal combustion engine. We
  can literally cut the rate of type-2 diabetes in half with one law.
- Literally shut down every fast-food restaurant in the country (with a
  few carefully selected exceptions, and even those would have their
  menus and food offerings closely scrutinized). Any unhealthy eating
  outside of the home causes a drain on the healthcare system.
- Every restaurant in America will have to have their menu approved by
  the government, and any restaurant which cannot modify its menu to
  meet strict health guidelines will be immediately and unceremoniously
  closed down.
- Then, to ensure that people are actually eating correctly, we can
  install cameras in their kitchens so we can see what they are feeding
  their children, and we can send CDC goons immediately to their houses
  if they try to feed anything unhealthy. It is for our good, after all,
  because unhealthy people are a drain on the healthcare system.
- Everyone gets a government-issued Fitbit and you must wear it and it
  must connect back to the government. You must get 10,000 steps a day
  and you must raise your heart rate to workout levels three times a
  week. If you fail to do this, the government carts you off to "health
  camp" where you will work directly with government trainers for a
  week-long boot camp where you will learn the finer points of push-ups.

And the benefits don't stop there! This will literally spur new
technology:

- In-body calorie sensors to detect your caloric intake and warn you
  (and the government) when calories in exceed calories burned
- In-body sensors which determine your level of exercise and notify the
  government if you don't get enough

There's just so many things we can do, my mind is racing! I can't write
them down fast enough!

For the uninitiated, the preceding was *sarcasm*.

As I was writing, I literally felt like what I imagine Orwell felt like
when writing *1984*.

Again, for everyone else, there is literally **no way in Hades** that we
would ever let any of that stuff happen, not here in the United States.

It literally only happened during COVID because it was so new and so
unknown. But not anymore. We know what COVID is. We know what it does.
We also know what the "vaccines" do and more importantly, what they
*don't.*

But we went along with it during the pandemic because...it was a
pandemic (or the closest thing we've had to one in decades).

In short, **you can't mandate someone be healthy.** At best, you can
provide "incentives" for people to become healthier. Perhaps you can tax
sugary drinks at a higher level than non-sugar drinks...oh wait, we
already do this. Perhaps you can move forward, and give tax breaks when
you complete fitness programs. Actually, most employers already do this,
because it saves them money when their employees are healthier. And it
makes them even more money when their employees are working and not out
sick. My employer even buys my Fitbit.

Maybe the government could think about tax breaks for fast food
companies which improve their menus; lower sodium, sugar, empty carbs
and fat, and increase minerals and vitamins, fiber, and greens.

But *forcing* people to be healthy is the first step towards
*totalitarianism*, and we will vigorously defend against that.

(EDIT) I read through my answer, and I heard you screaming at your
monitor. You were saying, "Yes, but how do we control the spiraling
costs of healthcare? Can't we reduce the drains on our healthcare
system?"

Yes we can, but those drains are not *patients*. The vast majority of
those drains come directly from *government intervention*, **exactly the
kind of intervention you wish to impose on the public.** The next
largest drain on the healthcare system comes from **healthcare insurance
companies,** which don't actually offer health *insurance*, but
*pre-paid healthcare plans*. Fixing that would greatly reduce the drain
on our healthcare system.

How can the government legally force individuals to be healthy in
America and not eat like pigs, we forced a vaccine on people, why not
health and fitness for those who are a drain on the healthcare system?
