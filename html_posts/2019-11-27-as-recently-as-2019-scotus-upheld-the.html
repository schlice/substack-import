**As recently as 2019, SCOTUS upheld the "separate sovereigns" doctrine.
Is there any legal reason why a separate sovereign (AKA one of the
States) couldn\'t indict a sitting US President if s/he broke the law in
that state?**

The answer to all legal questions is "it depends."

In this case, a state has never tried it, so we simply don't know if a
state could indict a sitting president. It would also be far too easy
for the President to claim that acquiescing to such a demand would be
far too disruptive to the functioning of the government to entertain.
And as a practical matter, a state would have a really tough time
enforcing such an indictment against the President.

Additionally, a state which disagrees with the President could be
accused of trying to use state prosecutorial authority to disrupt the
President's Constitutional authority as granted by the voters.

The state would have a much better chance of getting the President to
comply after he has left office. The state issuing the indictment would
have to work closely with the state wherein the ex-President now resides
in order to compel extradition to face those charges.
