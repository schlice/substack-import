Your can contact the Public Affairs division of the police department in
question. They **may** provide you with information as to what was going
on, but they are under no obligation to do so. You can also discuss
policy and strategy with them, and perhaps work with them on getting the
word out to local citizens when something happens.

Often, police departments will publish their "blotter" online (mine
does). Check with your city government website and click through to your
police department website to see if yours does. Our city and county
police departments, Sheriff's offices, and PIOs (public information
officers) will actively tweet new additions to the police blotter. It's
pretty convenient. A quick look at my phone keeps me updated on the
goings-on around the community. Just this morning the police announced
via their Twitter feed that they made an arrest in a recent string of
catalytic converter thefts (apparently, I learned, you can recover the
platinum from a catalytic converter).
