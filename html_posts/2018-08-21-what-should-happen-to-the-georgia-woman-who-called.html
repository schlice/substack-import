**What should happen to the Georgia woman who called police on herself
after accidentally leaving her 3 yr old son in a hot car for three
hours? (The child has been checked out by a hospital and is fine)**

You're asking what "should happen" as if it's up to us to decide.
However, you know that something has already happened. She was arrested
and charged with second-degree cruelty to children. Her bond is set at
\$5,700.

So maybe you're asking what would be the right thing for police to do in
this situation. Therefore, it could either be something other than what
they did, or exactly what they did.

The story is missing a lot of details. When someone calls police and
reports themselves, generally that leads to a little bit of leniency.
The story (as well as [[the story on the local news
channel](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7462bd&url=http://www.cbs46.com/story/38922097/woman-arrested-after-leaving-child-in-locked-hot-car){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="cbs46.com"}]{.qlink_container} about the incident) do not
provide the extra details about what prompted the police to arrest her
after she self-reported.

I would like to provide an answer as to what I think the police and the
DA should have done in this scenario, but the lack of supporting details
makes me think that there is more to this story than we are being told,
and it's difficult to render an opinion without those details.
