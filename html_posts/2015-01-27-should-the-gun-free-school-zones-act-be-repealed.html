**Content:** [*Is it an effective means at reducing firearms violence in
schools?*\
\
Based on the amount of firearms violence in schools, the people doing
the shooting don\'t much care if there is a Gun-Free School Zones Act or
not.\
\
The law-abiding citizens who \*could\* be armed and who would normally
pose no danger to kids in schools and who could potentially stop a mass
shooter in a school, however, is hamstrung because he actually follows
the laws.\
\
So the Act has exactly the opposite effect of what it was going for: it
keeps the law-abiding citizen from preventing a crime, and allows the
criminals to shoot with abandon, knowing there will be no armed
opposition from law-abiding citizens.\
\
Sounds like a candidate for repeal to me\...]{.rendered_qtext}
