**Does a high IQ score stop you from being a police officer?**

Think logically about this for a second. If you found out that your
local police department was giving simple IQ tests to candidates (not
police entrance exams) and were summarily rejecting anyone who scored
over some arbitrarily high score, would you be happy with the employment
practices of your local police department? Would you not complain to
City Hall?

I know I certainly would.

I want my police department to hire the smartest people they can get,
who can exercise the most sound judgement when it comes to all manner of
activity they must perform.

In fact, police departments have no idea what your IQ is. They don't
give an IQ test to join the department. They give a state-standardized
general knowledge test. Each state's standardized police entrance exam
is different, but all states give one.

You can ace that test and you are moved on in the selection process just
as easily as someone who barely passes.

The selection process is more than just a test. Much, much more.

And yes, it is true that one small department in Connecticut more than
20 years ago was sued because they disqualified a candidate using a high
IQ as the reason. But this case has never been repeated in any other of
the over 18,000 police agencies across the country in any of the
intervening years since. This case is the exception rather than the
rule.
