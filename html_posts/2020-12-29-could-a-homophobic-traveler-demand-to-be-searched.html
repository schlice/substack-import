**Could a homophobic traveler demand to be searched by a woman instead
of a male officer at airport or border checks?**

Yep. They can demand whatever they want. However, especially at border
checks, there is no requirement to acquiesce to any of those demands.

The choice would be:

1.  Allow this man to search you
2.  Do not cross the border.

The traveler would have to determine which was more important: his
homophobia, or crossing the border. The choice would be up to him.

See? Life is all about choices.
