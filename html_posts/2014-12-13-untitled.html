**Content:** [I read what you said. However, you have no idea what
you\'re talking about.\
\
You expect the police policy to take into account the fact that people
are too stupid to understand that when they are outnumbered they
shouldn\'t resist. Yet you insist that this is a normal response and the
police should, what, slap him with a wet noodle? Tickle him with feather
dusters?\
\
The police are there to enforce the law. Someone can go to jail
compliantly or non-compliantly. There\'s not much in-between there. You
presume too much. And you have no idea what you\'re talking about.\
\
The local police department is hiring. Why don\'t you put your money
where your mouth is and join up and make a difference?]{.rendered_qtext}
