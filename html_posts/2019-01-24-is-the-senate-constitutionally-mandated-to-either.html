**Is the Senate constitutionally mandated to either amend or consent to
appropriations (not allowed to ignore such appropriations)?**

The correct answer is **no**, there is no Constitutional requirement for
Congress to do its job. This is why, in quite a number of years,
Congress has not passed a budget. There is no penalty for Congress to
fail to pass a budget, either because the budget could not be resolved,
or because of inaction in one chamber.

Appropriations bills are controlled by law, not by Constitutional
mandate. The law governing appropriations is called the Congressional
Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 , or just abbreviated as the
Congressional Budget Act (CBA). Under CBA, the process works this way:

- The President submits a budget. He generally has until the first
  Monday in February to submit his budget to Congress. It's important
  for the President to submit a budget to Congress, because it lets
  Congress know what the President's fiscal priorities are for his
  agencies, as well as what he will agree to, or veto if it is not
  present in the final bill (i.e. border funding in FY2019).
- The Appropriations Committees in both Houses of Congress create
  **budget resolutions** based on the President's budget. These
  resolutions do not go to the President, but instead go to their
  respective chambers for consideration by the entire chamber.
- The entire chamber considers, and passes, each one of their budget
  resolutions. In current practice, the Senate typically passes the
  House bill with the Senate version attached as a single substitute
  amendment, which means that the House generally passes their budget
  bill first, and the Senate amends their bill to the House bill.
- The House and Senate Appropriations Committees will meet to iron out
  the differences between their two bills.
- The committee produces a **conference substitute for the bill** which
  goes back to the full chambers for review. Usually, like the original
  appropriations bill, the House considers conference reports on
  appropriations measures first. The first chamber to consider the
  conference report may vote to adopt it, reject it, or recommit it to
  the conference for further consideration. After the first house adopts
  the conference report, the conference is automatically disbanded;
  therefore, the second house has only two options---to adopt or reject
  the conference report. The measure cannot be sent to the President
  until both houses have agreed to the entire text of the bill.
- Once both Houses have agreed to the bill, it is sent to the President
  for signature. The President can either sign it, veto it, or do
  nothing. If he does nothing, the bill automatically becomes law when
  it has been on the President's desk for 10 days **when Congress is in
  session**. If he takes no action, and Congress is not in session in 10
  days, the bill does not become law. This is known as a [[*pocket
  veto*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3aad86&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocket_veto){.external_link

Additionally, specific to your question, there is no penalty for
Congress failing to pass a budget. Congress under the CBA has until
April 15th to present a budget to the President for signature. Since
1977, Congress has frequently not met this target date. In many
instances in recent years (1999, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2011 through 2015,
and 2017), Congress did not adopt a budget resolution at all. There is
also no penalty for Congress missing its deadline.
