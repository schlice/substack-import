If you didn't split the ownership when you got your divorce, then yes,
both parties on the deed will receive half of the net proceeds. Marital
status has no effect on the deed to the property.

In just about every state, having both names on the deed to the house
creates a legal presumption that you are 50-50 owners. When you sell the
house, any net proceeds will be split evenly between the two owners.
