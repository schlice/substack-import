**When it\'s reasonable to suspect on breast cancer? What if I\'m
feeling tension and pressure on my chest often? Sometimes even pain in
my veins? I\'m 20 and I have thoracic scoliosis.**

It's very rare for tension and pressure or even breast pain to be breast
cancer. Breast pain is rarely cancer. Breast pain is usually hormone
related, and usually changes with your menstrual cycle.

That said, if you have unexplained breast pain that doesn't go away
within one or two menstrual cycles, you should see your doctor.
