**Is impeachment a legislative action?**

Impeachment is an action that can only be carried out by the Legislative
branch of government, so in that sense it is a legislative action.

I think you were meaning to ask whether impeachment is a *legal* action
or a *political* action. In that sense, impeachment is a *political*
action. In other words, you don't technically need to break a law in
order to be impeached.
