I'm glad that you want to learn this information! It's only useful at
the very moment you need it, but you need to know it **before** you
actually need to use it.

I would highly recommend getting your CPR certification from the
American Red Cross (assuming you are in the United States).

If you are in the United States, [[please check

the nearest class.

The maneuver you will be learning is called the Heimlich Maneuver, also
called "[[abdominal
thrusts](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=266008&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_thrusts){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}." In practice, it's a
very odd sensation to attempt to do these and not feel slightly
perverted while you are doing it. Essentially, assuming your victim is
upright, you are "hugging" the victim from the rear, as close as you can
get to the victim (i.e. your chest flat up against their back), and you
reach around to their abdomen, just below the ribcage. Form a fist with
one hand, and cup the fist with the other hand. The fist is placed on
the abdomen, and with upward thrusts, you basically want to make a
motion as if you are trying to lift the victim off of the ground. This
will force air out of the lungs and will force the lodged item out of
the throat.

What you **do not** want to do is slap the victim on the back. This will
only serve to lodge the item further into the throat. The only time you
*might* slap anyone on the back is with an infant, and that is only when
you *invert* the infant with one hand, and slap the back with the other
hand. This is a more skilled maneuver, and the maneuver which is
preferred is the prone abdominal thrusts and the finger sweep to clear
the mouth. This may need to be followed by CPR if the victim is not
breathing, so just knowing Heimlich is good, but incomplete knowledge to
effect a rescue.

Perfecting the execution of these techniques takes a little hands-on
practice, which is why I highly recommend a class.
