SCOTUS does not extend rights to anyone. Unless, of course, you're
talking about *Griswold v. Connecticut,* the most recent example of
SCOTUS extending rights to anyone.

*Griswold* was the last case in which SCOTUS invented a right to give to
someone, and that was the right to privacy. This right does not exist
anywhere in the Constitution, but SCOTUS at the time found it. Where,
you might ask? In the "emanations and penumbras" of the Constitution.

Basically, it works like this. Let's assume a hotel has a sign which
says "No Dogs, Cats, or Birds Allowed." One type of SCOTUS justice would
read that sign and say, "Your pet snake is allowed because the sign does
not say that snakes are not allowed. If the owner wanted to disallow
snakes, he would have put 'Snakes' on the sign." These type of justices
are known as "textualists" or "originalists." They believe that the
Constitution means exactly what it says, its interpretation should be
based on the common understanding when it was written, and if you want
it to mean something else, you have to modify the Constitution using one
of the documented methods to do so.

A second type of SCOTUS justice would read the same sign and think,
"Well, the person who wrote that sign was generally trying to exclude
any sort of common pet from the hotel, so your pet snake is therefore
not allowed." These types of justices are generally known as
"non-originalists." They believe that the Constitution should be
interpreted in accordance with the climate of the day, not based on the
interpretation when it was written, because the framers indicated that
they didn't want their specific intentions to control interpretation.

It is the non-originalists who fashioned the findings in *Griswold*, the
most classic example of imputing meaning *into* the Constitution instead
of reading it for exactly what it says.

Therefore, **to stop SCOTUS from extending rights to anyone, you must
remove anyone who has a non-originalist mindset**. The Constitution
means exactly what it means, and if the people want it to mean something
else, they can amend it. It's been amended before, even very recently
(i.e. within the last 30 years), so it can be amended again. Yes, it is
not easy. But it was not designed to be easily amended. It was designed
with a relatively high bar.

Original question:

How do we fix SCOTUS so that they can no longer extend rights to
corporations at the expense of the people?

*Ugh, I had to disable comments again.*

*If you are a non-originalist, please feel free to write your own answer
about how we can fix SCOTUS so they can no longer be non-originalist.*

*But you're not going to convince me that "a right to privacy exists in
the Constitution" because it simply does not.* ***Griswold*** *got it
wrong. But it wasn't the wrong* ***outcome*** *(that's a whole other
discussion). It's the wrong* ***method to achieve the outcome****. In
other words, the ends do not justify the means.*
