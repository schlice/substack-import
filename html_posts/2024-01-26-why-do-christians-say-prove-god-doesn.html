Atheism is an affirmative position which states that god does not exist.
It is not a "maybe." It doesn't say "maybe God doesn't exist," because
that's something else. That's agnosticism or skepticism. Those positions
say "we don't know whether or not God exists" or "we can't know whether
or not God exists."

Atheism affirmatively says "God does not exist." And truthfully, in
order to make this claim, there must be some sort of evidence possessed
by the believer that his belief is true.

This is where Christians get caught in a trap, because the atheist has
exactly as much evidence that God doesn't exist as the theist has for
the existence of God. The theist may have logical and philosophical
reasons to believe that God exists, but the physical evidence for God's
existence is the same as the physical evidence which proves that God
doesn't exist: there is none.

Atheists should be cautioned against asking Christians to prove that God
exists, because they have exactly as much evidence that God does not
exist as the theist has for God's existence.
