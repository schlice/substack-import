Davis was born August 4, 1942, and died June 29, 2008. He is best known
for playing General George Hammond in the television series [[*Stargate:
SG-1*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b57143&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_SG-1){.external_link

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} starring Richard Dean
Anderson.

He was living in British Columbia at the time, and died of a heart
attack, just shy of his 66th birthday.

He was an actual Army captain back in the day before his acting career,
and he played literally the best general officer on television that any
military member could have asked for.

Here's a toast...
