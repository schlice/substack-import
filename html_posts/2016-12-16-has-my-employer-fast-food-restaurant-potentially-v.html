According to the Americans with Disabilities Act, this is a reasonable
accommodation (emphasis mine):

That said, the employer is not unreasonably cutting your hours. You were
only going to be working for 5 1/2 hours anyway, assuming they gave you
a 30 minute break. Cutting your hours to 4 hours does not change the
essential nature of the job (it's still a part-time job), and since they
are only cutting your hours from 5 1/2 to 4, they are only cutting 1 1/2
hours from your work day. If it is easier for them to schedule that as a
business, it sounds like it would be a reasonable accommodation.

I understand you're losing hours, but modifying your schedule in this
way is probably not something you can consider unreasonable from a
business perspective, and it appears to me to be reasonable.

However, if this is a major concern to you (I know it is because you're
losing hours), you should consider contacting an employment attorney who
is knowledgeable about ADA law in your state.
