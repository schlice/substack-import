> **Why do people refer to their pets as \"service animals\" now?**

People refer to their pets as service animals because they think it will
allow them to take their pets into public places where pets are normally
not allowed. They are not disallowed from those places because the
owners hate pets. Sometimes, they are disallowed for health code
reasons, and other times it's because they are disruptive and a
distraction.

A service animal is specially trained to perform a task related to a
qualifying disability. Business owners are allowed to ask if they animal
is trained to perform a task related to a qualifying disability, and
what that task they are trained to perform is. Beyond those two
questions, business owners cannot ask about the disability, or cannot
require the owner to show paperwork, the animal doesn't need special
clothing (i.e. a vest), etc. If the person refuses to say whether or not
the animal is trained and what they are trained to do, the owner can ask
the person and the animal to leave.

> **Is it legal for any animal to be certified as a service animal by

No. What they are trying to do is pass of Emotional Support Animals
(ESAs) as service animals. Service animals are specially trained to
perform specific tasks to assist a person with a disability. Service
animals have full public access rights, which means they can go places
other animals can\'t. For example, they can go into restaurants, stores,
libraries, and other public places. They can also go on airplanes and
other public transportation.

ESAs provide companionship and emotional support, but they aren\'t
required to perform specific tasks. They are covered under the Fair
Housing Act, but hotels aren\'t subject to this act. But as I mentioned
above, unless your state has special protections for ESAs, they don\'t
have the same protections as service animals. They can be excluded by
businesses.
