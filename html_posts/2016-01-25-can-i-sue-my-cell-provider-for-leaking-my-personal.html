I did ask you for more information, but it does appear you have a
specific legal question, which we cannot answer here on Quora.

[[How do legal disclaimers work on Quora? What is Quora\'s policy on
questions and answers about legal issues and
problems?](https://www.quora.com/unanswered/How-do-legal-disclaimers-work-on-Quora-What-is-Quoras-policy-on-questions-and-answers-about-legal-issues-and-problems)]{.qlink_container}

Anyway, you can sue anyone for anything you choose. If you can find a
lawyer to represent you, I\'d say go for it.

However, in the case of a data breach where a large amount of people are
likely affected, it\'s probable that if there is cause, there is a
class-action lawsuit ongoing. I\'d definitely contact the lead attorneys
in the class-action suit and give them your information. I\'m certain
they\'ll want to talk to you.
