Besides the fact that you are comparing apples to oranges, your facts
are also incorrect.

Capitalism is an economic system wherein the market is allowed to
control prices. That means prices for everything from goods to services.
It runs off of an economic principle called *supply and demand*. In
general, what this means is that, all else being equal, supply is
inversely proportional to price, and demand is directly proportional to
price. For example (again all else being equal), if supply goes up and
demand stays constant, price goes down. If demand goes up and supply
stays constant, price goes up. This includes supply and demand for
everything, including labor.

"Ignoring laws" and "shooting people simply because you own a gun" is
not capitalism. It's actually not an *economic* system at all. It's a
system of government called *anarchy* wherein laws do not exist. It has
absolutely nothing to do with economics.

Apples and oranges.
