**You would have to make the case that you were in fear for your life.**
If it can be reasonably asserted that you felt in fear of your life, or
felt fear of serious bodily harm, you can use whatever force necessary,
up to and including deadly force, to overcome that threat.

Using your car to get away from the attackers (especially if you know
you're going to hit them) is reasonably going to be considered deadly
force. You must be prepared to defend yourself against the charge that
you used deadly force. You must be able to articulate that you were
afraid you were going to die, or you were going to be seriously hurt.
Additionally, you will be charged with leaving the scene of an accident
in which someone was either hurt or killed, which is also a felony.

If your car was encircled by a mob and you had to drive over them to get
away, you should **immediately drive to the nearest police station and
turn yourself in, and retain a criminal defense attorney from your
mobile phone on the way.** Immediately driving to the police station
would go a long way to convincing authorities that you had no intention
of not being responsible for your own actions.

Don't forget, you did use deadly force. You will likely be arrested
until the District Attorney investigates. At the very least, you will be
processed and released on your own recognizance. Be prepared for that,
too. But stand by your assertion that you were in fear for your life. If
your fear was reasonable, the self-defense argument should help you.
