If you've ever been to counseling, one of the key takeaways you learn is
that there is really no such thing as a soulmate. It's a pipe dream.
Everyone you meet has the capability of being someone "compatible" with
you, the question is of degree. "How" compatible someone may be is key.
Ideally, you want to start off with someone who is at least mostly
compatible, and work out the little differences later, with time.

The secret sauce of marriage: y*ou don't marry your soulmate.* You marry
someone whom you love deeply and with whom you want to spend the rest of
your life. Like new gears in a machine, there may be a few burrs and
rough edges that need to be smoothed down over time, but after a while,
***and with consistent effort***, those little rough edges will get
smoothed down and you will become *natural soulmates*.

You may not start off being able to complete your spouse's sentences,
but after a while, you will. You may not be able to walk into a store
and look at a rack of clothing and say, "my spouse would love that," but
over time, you will. You may not be able to walk into a store right away
and know what purchases you make that may upset your spouse, but as time
goes by, you will. Those things will come, over time.
