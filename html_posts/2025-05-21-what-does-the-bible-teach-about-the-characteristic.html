There's quite a lot! But you're not going to find it just in Ezekiel.

> *And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within

What is being described here is a process Christians call
*regeneration*. Back in the day, we called it "being born again" from
Jesus' discussion with Nicodemus in John 3. Nicodemus was very wise, and
wanted to talk to Jesus about His earthly ministry, but he couldn't
afford to be seen by the other rabbi. So he visited Jesus at night:

> *Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the
> Jews. This man came to Jesus by night and said to him, "Rabbi, we know
> that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can do these signs
> that you do unless God is with him." Jesus answered him, "Truly,
> truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the
> kingdom of God." \-- John 3:1--3 ESV*

"Born again?" So what, I have to crawl back up inside my mother's womb?
Nicodemus was rightly perplexed.

> *Nicodemus said to him, "How can a man be born when he is old? Can he
> enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born?" --- John 3:4
> ESV*

Jesus continued.

> *Jesus answered, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of
> water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. That which
> is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is
> spirit. Do not marvel that I said to you, 'You must be born again.'

Jesus says that to be "born again," to experience *regeneration*, one
must be born of "water and the Spirit." What did Jesus mean by that?
There are several possible ways to interpret that statement, but I think
the most compelling is this: being born of the Spirit is clearly a
reference to accepting Christ, but the aspect of water is less sure. The
most reasonable interpretation is that "water" refers to the spiritual
cleansing which accompanies repentance. But that does not mean that
baptism is mandatory for salvation. John the Baptist\'s ministry of
baptism happened before Jesus' ministry. In other words, faith in Christ
is an absolute requirement for salvation. The physical ritual of baptism
is not (cf John 3:16, 36; Ephesians 2:1--10; Titus 3:5).
