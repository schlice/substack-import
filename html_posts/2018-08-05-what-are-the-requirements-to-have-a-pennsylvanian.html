**What are the requirements to have a Pennsylvanian driver license?**

The requirements are the same as for any state's driver's license:

- Be a resident of that state who is of legal age to drive a car
- Pass a driving test (written and practical)
- Pay a processing fee

That's it. Very simple. Now clearly, there are more specifics, such as
teen drivers requiring driver's ed, or exceptions for medical
conditions, or many other specifics, but in general, the requirements
are really simple and are the same requirements in every state.

For more specifics about Pennsylvania's driver's licensing, check out
