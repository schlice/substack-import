Depends on where you are licensed and where you are stopped.

In some locations, you can be arrested for not driving with a license,
especially if you have no other form of identification and you cannot
prove your identity. In others, it's a fine and the offense itself can
be dismissed if you take your license down to the courthouse and show
them that you were a licensed driver on the day you were stopped.

For your registration and your insurance, it's purely a dismissible
offense In other words, you get a fine but the offense can be dismissed
if you show the court you had insurance or that your car was registered
on the day you were stopped.

But again, it's different for every state.
