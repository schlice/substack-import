**Content:** [Not all departments use the same terminology, so not
everyone will know what a \"5150 hold\" is. You\'re asking about a
\"psych hold,\" or what we commonly call \"emergency hospitalization for
evaluation\" (EHE).\
\
Every state is different, and has different standards. The police in
that state know the rules for that state. [[Here\'s a
breakdown](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ec1b8f&url=http://treatmentadvocacycenter.org/storage/documents/Emergency_Hospitalization_for_Evaluation.pdf){.external_link

rules by state.\
\
Basically, in most states, if a police officer or other \"intervening
official\" sees someone whom he reasonably believes has a mental defect
or deficiency, and that person is deemed to be a potential threat to
himself/herself or to others, the intervening official can place the
person into custody or cause the person to be placed into custody, and
have that person treated by a mental health professional for (usually)
72 hours.]{.rendered_qtext}
