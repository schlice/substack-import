The only way to remove a United States president who is "not performing
well" is to **not re-elect him in the next election.** Impeachment is
not for presidents who are "not performing well." Impeachment is for
*high crimes and misdemeanors*, not for "poor job performance."
Although, Democrats have watered down the impeachment to the point where
"anything we don't like" is an impeachable offense.

The United States chose not to include a recall option for the President
(like many other countries have) because the office of the President was
never designed to represent the people. It was designed to be the head
of the Executive Branch, to execute the laws written by the *true*
representatives of the people, the Congress. There was never intended to
be one seat of power in the United States.

But the office of the President has morphed into the representative of
the people, which the framers never intended. And Congress has given
more authority to the President than the framers ever intended either.

Recall was never envisioned to be something that would be needed.
