**What are the chances of a relapse if I stop injecting Rebif for a week
or two? I just found out that almost all problems I have are Rebif\'s
side effects.**

Talk to your neurologist.

There are indeed chances that you will relapse after stopping Rebif.
[[Studies have been
done](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=78f3d0&url=https://meridian.allenpress.com/ijmsc/article/22/2/75/432651/The-Dilemma-of-When-to-Stop-Disease-Modifying){.external_link

the chance of relapse, and the results were inconclusive.

To that end, you should discuss the issue with your neurologist. You and
your neurologist should balance the risk of stopping Rebif with the
benefit of reducing side effects.

Perhaps, if the side effects are too severe to continue your therapy,
it's time to change to another therapy. Plenty of MS medications are
stopped because of side effects, some medications more than others. Some
medications are stopped due to risk of severe side effects (i.e. Tysabri
and the risk of PML). Maybe it's time to broach the subject of changing
your MS therapy drug with your neurologist.

Bottom line: talk to your neurologist about the pros and cons of taking
a "drug holiday."
