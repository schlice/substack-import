In the US, the answer is "it depends." It depends on local laws, but in
most states, emergency vehicles have red and/or blue lights. Yellow
lights are "caution" or "slow-moving" vehicles. They may also suddenly
stop without warning. They won't be overtaking drivers, and do not have
the right-of-way. Usually, you will overtake them.
