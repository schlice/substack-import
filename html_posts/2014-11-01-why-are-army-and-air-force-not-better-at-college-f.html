**Content:** [Service academies are not technically recruiting football
players. They are recruiting academy cadets who also play football.
Their primary reason for attending a service academy is to become
military officers. Football is secondary to that end.\
\
This doesn\'t mean that football isn\'t important; it is. Sports are
very important. Vitally important, actually. General Douglas MacArthur
said, \"On the fields of friendly strife are sown the seeds that on
other days and other fields will bear the fruits of victory.\" But
academy cadets have that \"other fields\" line in mind. Our guys are
there for military service first, and football second.\
\
Additionally, there are weight and size requirements for academy cadets.
They have to fit inside aircraft cockpits and tanks. We don\'t get the
big linebackers that other schools can get. It\'s just the nature of the
beast.\
\
So we focus on what we can achieve: being better than the other service
academies. As a matter of fact, Air Force is playing Army today, and if
they win, the Commander-in-Chief\'s trophy will be back at home where it
belongs. At the Air Force Academy. Go Air Force! Beat
Army!]{.rendered_qtext}
