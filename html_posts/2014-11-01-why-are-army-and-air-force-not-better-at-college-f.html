<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Service academies are not technically recruiting football<br>players. They are recruiting academy cadets who also play football.<br>Their primary reason for attending a service academy is to become<br>military officers. Football is secondary to that end.\<br>\<br>This doesn\'t mean that football isn\'t important; it is. Sports are<br>very important. Vitally important, actually. General Douglas MacArthur<br>said, \"On the fields of friendly strife are sown the seeds that on<br>other days and other fields will bear the fruits of victory.\" But<br>academy cadets have that \"other fields\" line in mind. Our guys are<br>there for military service first, and football second.\<br>\<br>Additionally, there are weight and size requirements for academy cadets.<br>They have to fit inside aircraft cockpits and tanks. We don\'t get the<br>big linebackers that other schools can get. It\'s just the nature of the<br>beast.\<br>\<br>So we focus on what we can achieve: being better than the other service<br>academies. As a matter of fact, Air Force is playing Army today, and if<br>they win, the Commander-in-Chief\'s trophy will be back at home where it<br>belongs. At the Air Force Academy. Go Air Force! Beat<br>Army!]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
