In the United States, you can wear whatever you want to wear. There are
no restrictions on anything you wear, as long as you cover up the bits
that are required to be covered. In other words, you must meet the
minimum decency standards in the jurisdiction in which you are located.

In specific to military uniforms, you can wear full military regalia in
the United States, even if you are not a member of the United States
military. There are some US codes related to military uniforms, but they
are largely unenforced because of First Amendment protections. Where you
run afoul of the law is if you attempt to extract some form of gain by
wearing the uniform. For example, some airlines will board military
members in uniform before other passengers. You, in your uniform, cannot
board ahead of anyone else as military members do, because you are not
one. Therefore, if you do, you could be charged with \"theft of
service\" or other \"stolen valor\" charges.

If you are up front about your wearing of authentic military clothing,
you will be just fine. At a US airport, just let them know that you\'re
not a military member; you are just a civilian wearing a military
uniform, and you do not expect (nor do you want) any special privileges.
This is perfectly legal.

Note that I can\'t speak for other countries, especially Britain,
considering you like British military clothing. I\'m only speaking for
the United States.
