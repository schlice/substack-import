**How can I know if someone is impersonating a law enforcement
officer?**

If that person is interacting with you, ask to see an ID card. All
uniformed law enforcement officers carry them, and will show them to you
on demand. Not a badge, but an ID card. Badges can be fairly easily
faked; ID cards, less so.

If the person is not interacting directly with you, feel free to call
the police and ask them if there is any activity in your area, and then
explain the situation. They will send the real cops to check it out.
