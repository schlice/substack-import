So let's make your hypothetical at least plausible. Let's assume the
Chinese take over the United States and they abolish the Constitution.
Then they make all religion (including Christianity) illegal.

What will Christians do?

**Go underground.**

How do we know? It's happened before.

At the outset of the French Revolution in 1789, people were forced to
swear allegiance to the Civil Constitution, which rejected papal
authority and aimed to establish a national church. Christians did not,
and people like Father (now Blessed) William Joseph Chaminade ministered
to the underground church in Bordeaux while disguised as a peddler. His
life story reads like a made-for-TV drama, with close calls and near
misses, with the thickness of a board separating him from the
guillotine.

TL;DR: So long as at least one person believes, Christianity will never
truly be abolished. And despite making it illegal, it will still be
practiced, in secret. Like Jesus told His disciples:

> But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your
> Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in
> secret, will reward you. --- Matthew 6:6 NIV
