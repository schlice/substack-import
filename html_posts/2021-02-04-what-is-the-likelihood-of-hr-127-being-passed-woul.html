**What is the likelihood of H.R. 127 being passed? Would it go to the
Supreme Court? Would it be affected at all by Miller V. Becerra from
California?**

*If* it passed (the chances of which are slim), it would be immediately
stayed because it contradicts several other laws already on the books.
It could not go into effect until Congress decides how to reconcile it
with its other laws. For example:

- The law requires each gun owner to be licensed. This alone is a
  violation of the 2nd Amendment, as you cannot license a right. You can
  *restrict* a right, but that comes from a different position (everyone
  has the right *except for* these select few). This law comes from the
  position of ***no one*** has the right *except for* those select
  licensed few, and that is a *prima facie* violation of the 2nd
  Amendment.
- The law requires each firearm in the United States to be registered to
  an owner. This is a violation of the Firearm Owner's Protection Act of
  1986, which states that neither the government nor any state can keep
  any sort of registry that ties any firearm specifically to any owner.
- Insurance. I don't understand why the Left doesn't get this. My
  insurance that I buy protects *me* from *someone else's* actions. My
  insurance doesn't protect *you* from *my* actions. And there isn't an
  insurance policy in the world (and there never will be) that protects
  *you* from *my* ***unlawful*** actions. No insurance policy pays out
  when someone does something illegal.\
  \
  (EDIT) Yes, liability insurance may kick in if you accidentally shoot
  someone, but that's not what the bill is discussing. It's discussing
  carrying liability insurance in case of injury following "any use" of
  your firearm, except insurance doesn't pay unless you were following
  the law, and only in the slimmest minority of cases was any accident
  fully legally compliant.
- More about insurance. Check out the insurance requirement in the bill
  (emphasis mine):

> \(d\) FIREARM INSURANCE.---

\$800 to the Attorney General's office for the **privilege** to buy
liability insurance (at additional cost over the \$800 fee) which will
probably *never pay out* so you can exercise a ***RIGHT?*** This
provision also likely would price the poor out of the firearms market,
which makes the bill a violation of the 14th Amendment, and also is
another violation of the 2nd Amendment. The poor are the very people who
need access to firearms. And since persons of color are
disproportionately represented in the poorer classes, **this bill is
also inherently racist.**

It's clear that this bill has a less than zero chance of passing.

Then why write it in the first place?

Two words: **virtue signaling**.

This bill is designed to show Rep. Lee's constituents that she is trying
to do something they want, and when it fails, she'll have a ready-made
foil to point to and say it's *their fault* that this bill didn't pass.
It's not, of course, but they'll still point to it and make the claim.
