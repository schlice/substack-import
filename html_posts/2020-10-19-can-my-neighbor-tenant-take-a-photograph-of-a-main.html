**Can my neighbor tenant take a photograph of a maintenance worker
inside of my apartment? She took it to use against him for the landlord
to fire him but I feel my privacy was invaded, I don't feel safe knowing
she watches inside my apartment.**

There's a lot to unpack here, so let's take it a little bit at a time.

**Can my neighbor tenant take a photograph of a maintenance worker
inside of my apartment?**

Usually, so long as the person is in a public place when they take the
photo, they can and it would not be illegal. Even if they take a picture
of someone visible from an open window. Also usually, the legality of
the photograph comes down to what the shooter intends to do with it. If
they want to use it to point out to the landlord that the maintenance
worker is violating company policy, or acting or behaving in a way
contrary to what the company would expect of a maintenance worker,
usually this would be acceptable.

**I feel my privacy was invaded\[.\] I don't feel safe knowing she
watches inside my apartment.**

*Nothing says that it is illegal for you to close your blinds.* If you
wanted to exercise your right to privacy, it would have behooved you to
close your blinds. Otherwise, it's quite possible that someone could
claim that you did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy with
open windows visible to public areas.
