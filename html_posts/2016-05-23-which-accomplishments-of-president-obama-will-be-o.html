The only items that the President can summarily overturn are anything
that a previous President has enacted via Executive Order. Therefore,
anything in that list which was enacted by Executive Order can be
rescinded by Executive Order.

Everything else was done through Congress, who actually writes law. The
new President can *recommend*, even *strongly recommend* creation and
passage of a particular law, but if Congress is disinclined to do so, it
doesn't get done.

Any Executive Orders which were passed because "Congress failed to act"
should be rescinded. If Congress failed to act, it's because Congress
lacked the political will to act (which also means the people did not
provide the requisite support to act, either). The President overrides
both the Constitution and the will of the people when he acts
unilaterally because "Congress failed to act." A failure to act is an
action in and of itself. Congress is deliberate in its inaction, just as
it is deliberate in its action. Failure to act doesn't mean they ran out
of time, or they couldn't figure it out. Failure to act means they
**chose** not to act. That is a deliberate choice.

And since Obamacare passed with **no Republican votes whatsoever** and
only passed because Democrats use a Parliamentary trick reserved for
budget negotiations (which Congress has also failed to do for years)
called *reconciliation,* don't be surprised if Republicans repeal
Obamacare using reconciliation as well. The only hope of such a tactic
working is with a Republican president.
