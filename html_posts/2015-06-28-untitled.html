**Content:** [I\'m really disturbed to hear that.\
\
I am not deaf, but I have my own disability to deal with. At least being
deaf, you know you\'re going to wake up the same way you went to bed. I
don\'t have that luxury. I may wake up and my legs won\'t work (had that
one). Or one of my eyes won\'t focus (had that too). Or I might not be
able to balance (well, there\'s always tomorrow).\
\
I am on the board of directors for my company\'s disability employee
resource group. We actively fight against this kind of discrimination,
which is why I find it so frustrating that this sort of thing is still
happening.\
\
I will do what I can to help, but that\'s not right.]{.rendered_qtext}
