**Content:** [I\'ve seen a few answers that hint around the issue, but
whether or not the government has a right to allow or deny a marriage
really hinges on what the government\'s overriding interest is in
regulating what two people do in their own home. *What is the state\'s
business in regulating marriage in the first place?*\
\
This is actually a valid question, because in discourse, it seems that
marriage has so long been accepted that people have forgotten why it
exists in the first place.\
\
Dan said that without marriage, he can\'t transfer property or be a
mutual caregiver. 30 minutes with a lawyer and a few signatures can
remedy that. True, it\'s not as \"easy\" as getting married (assuming
that you believe marriage is \"easy\"), but it functions in the same
way, and it is just as legally binding as a marriage. He also said, \"We
are in love, have been together for 6+ years and want our commitment
recognized by our government so as to protect our household and
relationships status under the law.\" Protecting household and
relationship status is just as easy as defining caregiver status. Just
as you can sign a contract defining property rights, rights of
survivorship and critical care rights, the same document can protect
household and relationship status under the law.\
\
So to the first part of Dan\'s quote, \"We are in love, have been
together for 6+ years and want our commitment recognized by our
government\[.\]\" What overriding government interest is there in
recognizing commitment? If that were the only thing that government was
doing by sanctioning marriage, why would they not recognize other types
of committed relationships as well? Why would they not recognize, for
example, the commitment of two best friends who have lived together for
decades, and have shared an apartment and bills and the like, and even
perhaps are raising one of their widowed children together? Why
wouldn\'t they be considered \"married\" too? Why would we discriminate
against them because they don\'t have sex with each other? Why would we
not allow a mother and her daughter to be considered \"married\" so that
they can raise the daughter\'s widowed child together? How could we then
exclude plural marriages? The state has no overriding interest in
\"recognizing commitment.\"\
\
So I am back to my original question: what business does the state have
regulating marriage?\
\
**The only state interest here is regulating sex, and the only reason
that the state needs to regulate sex is that because sex between a man
and a woman regularly produces children.** This does not mean that if a
man and a woman do not have children (or cannot have children), that
their marriage is invalid. The child does not validate the marriage.
However, the marriage provides the structure and the benefit that allows
the generativity for children to be in place. And while it may not be a
popular position, it is absolutely true that children have their best
chance of success in life by growing up in a home with the child\'s
biological mother and father. Does this mean that gay couples don\'t
make good parents? Does it also mean that all heterosexual couples are
automatically fit parents? We are not talking about the smaller
percentages of poor examples of any type of relationship. We are talking
about providing children with the best possible chance for success in
life. The state absolutely has the right, and the responsibility, to
ensure that children are given the best chance at success. The state can
therefore incentivize the type of relationship that will produce the
best chance for children to succeed. Therefore, providing incentives to
people who form the union best suited for raising children is necessary
and proper, and is in the state\'s best interest.\
\
Why, therefore, would gay couples want to be a part of an institution
that has no relationship to them? Is it simply because they want to
\"feel\" like a married couple? Are they seeking recognition and
acceptance by others, because I really don\'t think that any external
institution has any bearing on what a gay couple feels towards each
other, and I don\'t think they base their self-worth on what others
think. If it is about acceptance and recognition, then they are trying
to \"normalize\" their relationship by participating in an institution
that makes no sense for them to be a part of. Forcing \"normalization\"
onto society may seem right, but the state has no interest in
normalizing any particular relationship type.\
\
If gays get the right to marry, why would the state not recognize
marriages between multiple partners, or between multiple same-sex or
mixed-sex partners? Is not their commitment just as strong, and perhaps
their survivorship benefit questions more complex? I\'m not trying to
make a \"slippery-slope\" argument, but I\'m saying that recognition of
gay marriage leaves the door open for many other committed relationships
to be called \"marriage,\" whether or not sex is involved. So while Dan
has no interest in destroying heterosexual marriage, diluting or
changing its meaning will essentially destroy it. So while he may think
that it is his right to get married, he is actually seeking to change
the very definition of marriage, which will essentially destroy the
institution and will destroy the very reasons we had state-sanctioned
marriage in the first place.\
\
So I think I am asking the same question. Why do gay people want to get
married?\
\
Love may be blind, but marriage is a real eye-opener.
