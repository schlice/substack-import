**Is an HOA a profitable business?**

No. HOAs do not make any profit at all. In fact, they are 501(c)4
non-profit corporations. To that end, they do not make a profit at all.
Their balance sheets always come out to zero.

What *does* make profit is the company which assists HOAs in doing their
job. Managing agents work for real estate companies. Those real estate
companies *do* make a profit off of HOAs, usually in fees levied against
incoming and outgoing homeowners. They charge hundreds of dollars to
ensure that a homeowner is "in good standing" in the HOA before they can
close on their house. They charge hundreds of dollars for "account setup
fees" for incoming homeowners. And most Boards of Directors for HOAs
never even notice how much their managing agent is charging for these
services.

Apparently, running a group of managing agents is a *very* profitable
business.
