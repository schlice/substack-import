**What would you put in a roommate agreement with an illegal sublet?
(Yes it's not ideal, but there are extenuating circumstances on both
sides).**

Subletting your apartment when your lease agreement does not permit
subletting, or violating the city's rules regardless of what the lease
says, leaves **you** in trouble with the landlord, not your tenant, so
your roommate agreement is useless because you'll both be on the street.

Best advice: try to work with your landlord to either allow the sublet,
or add the roommate to the lease.

If you have further questions, you should try to find a tenant advocacy
group in your area and consult them for legal help, or consult a real
estate attorney.
