He should have, but I can understand why he didn't.

You might think that your husband just instantly "cuts the apron
strings" and instantly joins you at your side and you two are "one
flesh" for ever and ever.

But that's not exactly how it happens.

Instead, the "cutting of the apron strings" is a much slower process.
Your husband has to "grow" into that relationship with you. Remember,
his mother was the only significant woman in his life for many years.
He's not going to just up and turn on her just because you're married
now. And mom is going to have to learn to start letting go, even though
it's evident that she may have some separation issues herself.

Her comments may have been very wrong, but he's going to have to take
some time to let it sink in.

Here's the important part though: **I know you want to ream him up one
side and down the other for not "standing up for you."**

**DON'T DO IT.**

If you yell at him because he didn't stand up for you, he will only
resent you for coming between him and his mother when it is he who must
come to that conclusion on his own. Instead, talk to him about how her
comments made you feel. Tell him that his mother should respect you for
who you are, and should respect you as his wife, and her comments do not
do that. Tell him that you deserve more respect as a wife, and it's up
to him to ensure that his family respects you.

Please understand that this will take time. You, obviously, want it to
take *less* time than it already does, but it will take time. You'll
have to be patient with him while he learns.

Original question:

MIL called me a B\*tch and Wh\*re and other horrible things during one
of her rants and my husband just sat there and didn't say anything.
Shouldn't he of told her that he won't let her disrespect me like that
ever?
