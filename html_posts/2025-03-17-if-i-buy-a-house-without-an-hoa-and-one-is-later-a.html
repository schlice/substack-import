The answer, as with all legal answers, is "it depends." And what it
depends on is **state law**.

Most states **do** permit mandatory HOAs to be formed in neighborhoods
where there was none before. However, the amount of consent that
existing homeowners must provide varies.

- In most states, **unanimous** consent is required to form a new,
  mandatory HOA (for example, here in NC, to form a mandatory HOA where
  there was none requires unanimous consent of the affected homeowners).
- In some states, however, only a **supermajority** of homeowners is
  required (for example, TX law allows POAs to be formed with a
  supermajority of homeowners). However, there are usually exceptions
  which permit you (the current homeowner) to **opt-out**. For example,
  in TX, there is a one year right to opt-out of the newly formed HOA
  (of course, if you sell your house, the new owner would be
  automatically subject to the HOA).

If you happen to be in a state which can form a mandatory HOA in your
area without your permission, and you are being forced to participate
against your will, we recommend not ignoring it, but **fighting** it. We
strongly recommend retaining a real estate attorney in your area who
specializes in HOA law. If you do ignore it without fighting it, the HOA
can make legal trouble for you, and then it will become much harder to
resist the changes.
