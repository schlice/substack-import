**Content:** [I added \"Questions That Contain Assumptions\" because you
(wrongly) assume that US troops amassing along the border of another
country is a maveuver designed to deter them from economic expansion.\
\
The only borders that the US can amass troops against are its own.
Therefore, unless we\'re hell-bent on ruining Canada\'s or Mexico\'s
economies (we\'re not), we certainly would not do this.\
\
Any US troops in another country aren\'t massing along a border. Unless
you have some valid sources to show that this is happening, I\'m going
to believe that it\'s not.]{.rendered_qtext}
