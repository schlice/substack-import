**Is there a people-counting device that tells you how much people are
in a building and you can directly access that info in real-time from
your smartphone?**

Yes indeed, there are people counting systems which will give you fairly
accurate counts of the number of people in a room and even make that
data cloud-enabled.

In such a case, Google is your friend.
