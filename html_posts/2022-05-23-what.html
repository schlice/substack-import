You'll be arrested at the police station and charged with theft of
property (self-reported). What level of crime that turns out to be will
depend on how expensive the gun is that you stole.

Oh, in case I didn't make that clear: you would be a thief. Taking
someone's property that doesn't belong to you is theft, and you go to
jail.

And the gun owner will get his gun back.

So probably not the outcome you were hoping for. Maybe you ought to look
for a more productive way to channel your fear of guns.

Original question:

What\'s going to happen if I take a gun owner\'s gun for the police?
