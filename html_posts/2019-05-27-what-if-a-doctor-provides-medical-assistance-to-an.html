**What if a doctor provides medical assistance to an in-flight passenger
with an emergency? Can the doctor be held liable if the passenger he/she
helped dies?**

Despite Good Samaritan laws, doctors can be held liable in many
jurisdictions if they fail to render assistance.

However, failing to render assistance and failing to keep the patient
alive are two very different things.

If the doctor assisted and did everything in his power to keep the
patient alive, and the patient dies anyway, the doctor is not held
liable for that death. If, however, it can be shown that the doctor did
not provide adequate medical assistance, a case may be made for wrongful
death. It's highly unlikely that this would actually be the case,
however.
