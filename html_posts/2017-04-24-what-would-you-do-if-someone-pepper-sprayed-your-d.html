My 18 year old son read the question and said, "I'd punch that fucking
bitch in the face and say, 'Get the fuck out of here!'"

I can't disagree with his feelings, because that's exactly what I'd like
to do, but apparently with age comes some level of maturity. So while I
feel like he does, I must take issue with his methods.

So here's my take on it.

First of all, I know that pepper spray won't injure my dog. It will do
to my dog exactly what it does to me: it will sting my eyes and cause my
nose to run. It might irritate my sinus passages, and it might also
irritate my esophagus. I would have to watch my dog carefully over the
next few days to ensure that she wasn't suffering any unforeseen ill
effects from the spray, but I know that besides being in pain for some
time, she'll be fine.

Secondly, pepper spray is not a weapon in my state. It is a self-defense
tool. The person merely needs to feel threatened in order to deploy it.
However, I would argue that a muzzled dog isn't a threat to anyone, and
that the child approached the dog, not the other way around. It was the
*child* who was uncontrolled, not the *dog*. The woman's statement also
corroborates this account, as she essentially admitted that she
preemptively used her defensive tool as an offensive one, which would be
an improper use of a self defense tool. This, to me, would fall under my
state's definition of Cruelty to Animals, a violation of Colorado
Revised Statute 18--9--202. Conviction of Cruelty to Animals is a Class
1 Misdemeanor with a minimum fine of \$400, maximum fine of \$5000. In
addition to any other fine, a surcharge of up to \$400 shall be paid to
the county where the violation occurred to be put into the Animal
Cruelty Prevention fund.

Therefore, I would immediately be calling the police and getting a
report filed so that even if not convicted of an animal cruelty
violation, I'd know who to sue if there were any health-related
complications that followed the unlawful spraying.

Incidentally, I use a device on my dog called a Halti. There is a big
difference between a Halti...

...and a muzzle.

The Halti almost looks like a muzzle to the uninformed, doesn't it?
(well not to me, but to each his own I guess). It's also called a
"gentle lead" as it corrects a dog's improper pulling against a leash by
closing the dog's mouth when it pulls against the leash. For both of my
Goldens, application of the Halti almost instantly stopped the pulling
on-leash. My current Golden is a stubborn little girl though, and if she
really wants to go see something, she will actually endure the
mouth-closing effects of the Halti so she can see what she wants to see.
Nevertheless, I had someone ask me once why my dog was muzzled, and so I
had to explain what a Halti was, while I marveled at the lack of
understanding of what a muzzle is.
