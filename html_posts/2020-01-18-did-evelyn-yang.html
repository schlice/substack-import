**Did Evelyn Yang\'s doctor who assaulted her get a sweetheart deal from
the Manhattan DA that gave no jail time and kept him off a public list
of sexual offenders?**

I'm not sure how being a convicted felon, losing your medical license,
and being a registered sex offender is a "sweetheart" deal.

He may have avoided jail time by taking a plea agreement, but "taking a
plea" doesn't equate to "a sweetheart deal."

It's a plea deal. Nobody gets exactly what they want. Plea arrangements
are taken because getting the outcome you want in court is not
guaranteed, and the possibility exists that a jury may not see it the
same way the victim sees it. And sexual assault is most definitely, and
especially in the case of an OB-GYN, very difficult to prove.

The victims are always looking for "someone to pay" for what happened to
them. Victims always want to see the maximum amount of jail time. I
completely understand this desire for "a pound of flesh" for what
happened. But is that really *justice*? Or is that *revenge*?

Additionally, the DA's office is not charged with "making someone pay."
The DA's office is not charged with "getting the maximum amount of jail
time." The DA's office is charged with making sure that an alleged
aggressor does not have the opportunity to victimize someone else in
this way again, and their plea agreement ensures that not only will this
man never practice medicine again, he's a convicted felon and will never
be in a position of power again. He'll never be hired into any position
in which he'll have any position of power over a woman. As a matter of
fact, at his age, it's unlikely he'll ever have a meaningful job again
for the rest of his life. While his Level 1 Sex Offender status will
eventually fall off, he will always be a convicted felon, and he lost
his medical license, and won't ever really work again. He won't ever be
able to abuse women like this ever again.

I fail to see how that's a "sweetheart" deal.
