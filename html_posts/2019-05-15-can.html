**Can "Double Jeopardy" be a loophole for murder?**

It was this very "loophole" which prompted the writer of the 1999 movie
*Double Jeopardy* starring Ashley Judd. In the movie, Judd's character
was arrested for the murder of her husband, a murder which she did not
commit. She was tried, convicted and sentenced. She served out her
sentence, but while in prison, she learned that her husband faked his
own death and framed her for the murder. The remainder of her prison
term became preparation for the time when she would get out and
*actually* murder him, in cold blood, in the middle of a crowded street,
a murder for which she had already been tried and convicted. According
to the writer, the *double jeopardy* rule would protect her because you
can't be tried for the same crime twice.

Except in reality, that's not exactly how it would happen.

In reality, crimes have an element of *time* associated with them. For
example, we know that if you are convicted of a crime, and then in a
year they remove that crime from the books, you still have to serve your
sentence for that crime, because *at the time of your action, that
action was illegal.* Crimes are associated with the time when they are
committed, and the punishments for those crimes are associated with when
they are committed.

In actuality, had the scenario from the movie played out, she would have
been arrested, tried and convicted for the *actual* murder, and gone
back to jail. The first conviction would have been chalked up as a
regrettable incorrect conviction.

Since the man was actually alive, instead of killing him, she should
have had him arrested for filing a false police report, and then sued
the living sh1t out of him, taking him and his new wife to the cleaners
(since she was apparently loaded).

But that doesn't make for a great movie plot.
