**What do I do? My doctor offered me medical marijuana to deal with the
extreme nerve pain and muscle spasms being caused by my multiple
sclerosis, but I'm in recovery from addiction with over 9 years clean.
I'm not sure what I should do.**

I'm sorry your doctor did this. So long as your doctor knows you're an
addict, he never should have brought it up.

I'm not going to get into the "cannabis isn't addictive" argument
because it is completely irrelevant when it comes to an addict. That
said, you might consider using a cannabis derivative.

Before I discuss it further, cannabis is normally only refined in states
where medical marijuana is legal. If you are not in one of these states,
you're not going to be able to get the refined cannabis at all, and this
discussion is dead before it starts. But for the moment, let's assume
you're in a state where medical marijuana is legal and you can get
cannabis tinctures and oils.

They take the cannabis and separate the antioxidant-rich cannabidiol
(CBD) from the psychoactive tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and provide you
with an oil which contains only the CBD. The oil base is usually a
vegetable oil or a glycerine like a propylene glycol. If you have the
choice, go with the vegetable oil base rather that the propylene glycol.
You put a few drops on your food and you don't get high, you just get
the benefits of the CBD. The CBD has been shown to decrease neurological
pain as well as decreasing spasticity, so it's definitely a useful
treatment (it's not a snake oil just designed to distract you).

Whether or not you go this route is entirely up to you. If you do decide
to try a CBD oil, make sure your care team is fully aware of what you're
doing, and can help you through it. If, however, you decide the risk of
relapse (that's drug relapse, not MS relapse) is too great a risk to
take, then forget the whole idea. Go back to your doctor and tell him to
forget it and come up with another plan. There's a fair chance that any
commercial drug which might touch your pain and/or spasticity is going
to have some hefty side effects and is basically toxic, **and may also
be addictive itself!** (I'm looking at you, OxyContin). So part of the
problem here is that any alternatives which might actually work for you
may actually be addictive, while CBD oil would be the least addictive
(if at all) in the bunch.

If it were me in your shoes, and I had the choice between a CBD oil and
OxyContin, I'd go with CBD oil. However, this is a very personal
decision, and I can't imagine how difficult this decision must be for
you. I wish you all the best.
