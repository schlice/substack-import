Ultimately, it depends on what you mean by "I used to be a Christian."

What is it that you no longer believe in? Do you simply say that you're
not Christian anymore so you don't have to go to church? When you say
"spiritual but not religious" do you simply believe that there is a
"higher power" that is all around us but you can't put your finger on
it, or you simply don't care to? Like your higher power could even be
the collective consciousness and goodwill of all of the people in the
room, or something like that?

Are you still saved? It depends on whether or not you were ever saved in
the first place. Because I find it hard to believe that you truly
believed that Christ was your savior and he died for your sins, but now
you don't. What changed? What led you to believe that Christ did not die
for your sins? In my view, it doesn't look like you were ever saved in
the first place.

I used to be a Christian. Now I\'m spiritual but not religious. Am I
