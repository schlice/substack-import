This is not a valid statistic that can be known.

There are several things that would need to be true before you could
know what you are asking:

- SImply being unvaccinated, or not wearing a mask, would have to be a
  guaranteed cause of death, and it is not.
- Being vaccinated or wearing a mask would have to be a guaranteed
  prevention of transmission of COVID, and it is not.

Therefore, you can never know how many people have died because of
people refusing vaccination or masking, because vaccination and masking
do not prevent transmission of the disease, nor do they prevent death,
in themselves or others.

And before the comments start coming in, *slowing down* the rate of
transmission does not equal *preventing* transmission. *Reducing* the
likelihood of being hospitalized with severe illness does not equal
*preventing* death.

Statistically, how many people have died because of people refusing
vaccination or masking? Themselves or others?
