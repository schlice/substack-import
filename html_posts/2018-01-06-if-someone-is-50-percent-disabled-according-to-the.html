Everybody\'s case is different, and everybody ends up with different
compensation and benefits from the review of their particular case.
However, at 50% disability you do have access to the VA Medical system
to treat your particular disability.

You should have received a benefit letter with your VA disability
determination letter. This benefit letter should have described what
benefits you are now entitled to being 50% disabled. If you don\'t have
an explanation of benefits, call your VA Regional Customer Service
Center.
