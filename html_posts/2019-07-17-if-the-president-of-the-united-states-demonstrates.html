**If the President of the United States demonstrates he does not
understand the powers and duties of the Office, would that satisfy the
requirements of the 25th Amendment Section 4?**

No.

Notice the text of the 25th Amendment, Section 4 (**emphasis** mine):

> *Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal
> officers of the executive departments or of such other body as
> Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of
> the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their
> written declaration that* ***the President is unable to discharge the
> powers and duties of his office****, the Vice President shall
> immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting
> President.*

This says nothing about a *lack of understanding of his job*. This says
the President is ***physically unable to discharge his duties.***

But, you might say, it could mean that he is unable to discharge his
duties because he doesn't know what they are, or doesn't understand
them.

However, we can glean from the next paragraph of Section 4 why this is
untrue:

> *Thereafter, when the President transmits to the President pro tempore
> of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his
> written declaration that no inability exists, he shall resume the
> powers and duties of his office unless the Vice President and a
> majority of either the principal officers of the executive department
> or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit within
> four days to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker
> of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the
> President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.
> Thereupon Congress shall decide the issue, assembling within
> forty-eight hours for that purpose if not in session. If the Congress,
> within twenty-one days after receipt of the latter written
> declaration, or, if Congress is not in session, within twenty-one days
> after Congress is required to assemble, determines by two-thirds vote
> of both Houses that the President is unable to discharge the powers
> and duties of his office, the Vice President shall continue to
> discharge the same as Acting President; otherwise, the President shall
> resume the powers and duties of his office.*

What the rest of Section 4 says is that if the President is ***actually,
physically able to discharge his duties***, all he has to do is tell the
President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House that he
is actually ready to resume his duties. In practice, this means, "Hi,
I'm out of the hospital and I'm ready to get back to work."

If the Vice President AND a majority of the cabinet still says that the
President is physically unable to discharge his duties, then Congress
gets to decide if the President is physically unable to discharge his
duties. You need a 2/3 majority in both houses to say that the President
is physically unable to discharge his duties, and then the VP will
continue as Acting President.

**TL;DR: The 25th Amendment is used when the President is physically
unable to discharge his duties. The 25th Amendment is not used when the
President discharges his duties poorly, or without requisite knowledge,
or even dangerously. It is only used when the President is**
***physically*** **unable to discharge the duties of the office.**
