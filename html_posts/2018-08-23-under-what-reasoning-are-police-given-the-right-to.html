**Under what reasoning are police given the right to lie to the public
and in a court of law? Why aren\'t they held accountable for it?**

Your question is only half correct.

Police are allowed to lie to the public. This is **true**. Police
officers can lie to people (usually suspects), in exactly the same way
that people can lie to police. They're literally on the same footing.
There is no law that requires the police to always tell the truth, or
even to sometimes tell the truth in some situations.

You next stated that police have the right to lie in a court of law.
This is **false.** No one has the right to lie under oath. That is
called perjury, and anyone on the stand is subject to it.
