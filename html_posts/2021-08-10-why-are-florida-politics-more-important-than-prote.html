So let's see if we can first figure out the risk before we start
invoking the ***false dilemma*** of "it's either Florida politics or a
child's health." Thou shalt not use logical fallacies. *Strike one*.

First, we must get this ridiculous idea of containment out of our heads.
If vaccinated people can transmit the virus to anyone, including
unvaccinated and vaccinated people, then **there is zero hope of
containment.** Masks, which only had a 15% probability of slowing down
the virus **at best**, are entirely useless here. We know that 85% of
people who contracted COVID-19 wore their masks "always" or "often" and
88.7% of people who did not contract COVID-19 wore their masks as much
as that as well. Masks *marginally* help, but not much.

So if we can't *contain* the virus, and we basically know that **at some
point, everyone will get it,** what's the real risk? We must then
examine the risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19 in children.

The most complete study we currently have is from the UK, which studied
the time period February 2020 to February 2021. In that time, 25
children under 18 died from COVID-19. That said, most of them had
underlying health conditions:

- Around 15 had life-limiting or underlying conditions, including 13
  living with complex neuro-disabilities
- Six had no underlying conditions recorded in the last five years,
  though researchers caution some illnesses may have been missed
- A further 36 children had a positive Covid test at the time of their
  death but died from other causes.
- Though the overall risks were still low, children and young people who
  died were more likely to be over the age of 10 and of Black and Asian
  ethnicity.

Researchers estimate that 25 deaths in a population of some 12 million
children in England gives a broad, overall mortality rate of 2 per
million children.

In that same timeframe, 251 children were admitted to the ICU with
COVID-19.

**That means that a child under 18 has a 1 in 50,000 chance of being
admitted to the ICU, and a 1 in 500,000 chance of
dying.**[\[1\]](#mRvOV){#cite-mRvOV .citation_link}

The researchers say these studies are the most comprehensive on the
effects of COVID-19 in children in the world, cementing well documented
findings that *children are less likely to get seriously ill and die
from COVID-19 than adults.* [\[2\]](#qJycm){#cite-qJycm
.citation_link}There is a **thousand-fold** difference in risk of death
between the elderly and children.

So does this data require the "doom and gloom" analysis that many people
are pushing today?

While caution is always advised, I think that given this data, it makes
sense to not *mandate* masks for children, but *strongly advise* them.
Perhaps parents can, you know, **parent their children** and tell them
to wear their masks in school, or not. Masks aren't going to stop
transmission as we already know. So it's not like we're going to be
stopping children from spreading COVID between themselves and then
bringing it home. That's a risk that parents have to take, and you would
think that parents would be vaccinated, but again, that's up to the
parents to decide. It's not for the state to mandate.

So I'm not seeing the false dilemma of "either Florida politics or
children's health." I think that children, among any group, are at the
least risk from the worst outcomes from COVID-19. Let's focus our
efforts on those who are the most at-risk in society before we focus on
those who are arguably the least at-risk.

That's **common sense public health policy, driven by data**. If a
politician creates policy based on that, then I'm happy.

*Sorry, no comments on this one. Too contentious a topic, and too many
vax-pushers have no common sense, and I have no time to teach it to
them.*

*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is
grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,
downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora
is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply
going to comment to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" then you're
the reason why I disable comments. Well done, Karen. You ruined it for
everyone.*
