No, but they are setting up lower courts to hear many challenges as to
whether or not a particular discrimination is lawful.

The primary reason is because the case they are hearing now is not about
religion. It's only about *compelled speech*. The Court (as well as both
litigants) recognize that there is indeed a 1st Amendment freedom to
decline to speak, and the government cannot compel people to speak. That
is the central issue the Court is wrestling with: whether or not an
anti-discrimination law can compel someone to speak in violation of the
1st Amendment.

The discrimination, however, is not towards the people, but towards the
expressive speech. Here's an example related to this case: a homosexual
couple could buy a custom website celebrating a heterosexual marriage,
and the vendor would create that website. A heterosexual couple could
not buy a custom website celebrating a homosexual wedding; the vendor
would not create that custom website. It's not about the *client*, it's
about the *speech*.

So the question about whether or not the government can compel speech is
pretty clear, and the Court appears to be leaning towards making that
ruling. But finding the line between a 1st Amendment protected religious
exemption and a violation of state anti-discrimination law is going to
have to be left to case law. I'm certain that there will be cases that
clearly show an unlawful discrimination, and there will be cases which
show a clear religious exemption. But the state (in the states which
protect sexual orientation) has a vested interest in protecting a
certain class of people from discrimination, and the federal government
has a vested interest in not burdening the free exercise of religion.

It will take many years of litigation in order to find that clear-ish
line. SCOTUS, based on what I heard at oral arguments, appears to be
leaning toward ruling that applying a public-accommodation law to compel
an artist to speak or stay silent violates the free speech clause of the
First Amendment. The upshot of this is that in future cases, the state
will have the burden of proving that the conduct was actually
discriminatory and not protected by the 1st Amendment.
