Since you don't add a lot of context, I'll assume you're talking about
right here where I live in Orange County, Florida, on the evening of 23
Sep, into the early morning of 24 Sep, 2023.

[[https://www.fox35orlando.com/new\...](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0e0209&url=https://www.fox35orlando.com/news/armed-man-shot-killed-by-orange-county-deputies-overnight-sheriff-says){.external_link

On 23 Sep at about 9 PM, OCSO received a 911 call about a man
discharging a firearm in his backyard. Deputies arrived but found no one
and were unable to make contact with anyone.

Three hours later, at around 1 AM, another 911 call came in for the same
man pointing a gun at passing cars and at his roommate. Deputies arrived
and negotiated with the man for about 40 minutes, but he refused to come
outside.

Eventually though, deputies were able to convince him to come out.
Deputies hit the man with a TASER to attempt to subdue him, but the man
drew his firearm from his waistband and fired one shot, at which time
deputies opened fire. The man was pronounced dead at the scene.

So to answer your question: **yes.**
