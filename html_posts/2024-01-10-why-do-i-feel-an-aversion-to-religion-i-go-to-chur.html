Mahatma Gandhi is once quoted as saying:

> *I like your Christ, I do not like your Christians. Your Christians
> are so unlike your Christ.*

Perhaps you feel the same. Perhaps you connect "Christian" with "other
people who call themselves Christian, including some not-so-nice people
who give Christians a bad name." You might be surprised to learn just
how many people call themselves Christian, but couldn't be identified as
a Christian if they didn't speak the words "I'm a Christian." Another
pithy quote which exemplifies what you're saying: *If you were arrested
and put on trial for being a Christian, would there be enough evidence
to convict?* For some people, probably the people you are describing, I
feel like there wouldn't be enough evidence of Christianity in their
lives, much like the people Gandhi described.

What you call yourself isn't an issue. If you don't call yourself a
Christian, that's fine. What *is* important is that this feeling doesn't
change your feeling about God or your faith walk.

So while you may have an aversion to the word "Christian," don't blame
Christ for that.
