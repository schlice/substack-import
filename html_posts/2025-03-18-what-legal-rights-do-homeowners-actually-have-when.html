Legally, pets are property. You can't threaten my property legally. It'd
be like talking to my car, saying, "Car, I'm gonna hurt you." So
legally, property can't be threatened.

However, pets-as-property are not regarded as *fungible*. In other
words, if someone damages your car, it can be replaced with original
parts or with a totally new car. Pets, not so much.

Since pets are legally property, you *legally* can't defend property
with deadly force. But what you *can* do is **interpose yourself between
your property and the attacker**. Then it becomes a self-defense
situation, in which case you may defend ***yourself*** with whatever
force is necessary, up to and including deadly force.

But doing so would be highly legally fraught. You *inserted* yourself
into the situation which caused the situation to become a deadly force
situation. The situation was not a deadly force situation until you
inserted yourself in the middle of it, some might say, in order to
*cause* the situation to become one which would result in deadly force
where it wouldn't have otherwise.

Additionally, if your "property" is small and movable (like most pets),
creating a scenario which would require deadly force would not be looked
upon favorably. While you might escape jail time, you probably won't
escape the wrongful death lawsuit which would inevitably follow.

So that's all well and good, but what can you do?

Well, you can't use ***deadly*** force to protect your pets, but you can
use ***reasonable*** force.

Remember, force is a spectrum. There are lots of things you can do
**before** you reach the handgun to defend your pets from someone
physically attacking them. You shouldn't discount the use of pepper
spray, or even a pepper ball gun. Pepper ball guns are not lethal force
and in nearly every state do not need permits or licenses to carry (your
mileage may vary, check your state laws, etc). And pepper spray works
equally as well on people as it does on other dogs who might attack your
dog. Pepper spray is very effective against dogs.

As always, check your state laws before you carry anything to be used
for self-defense. If you ever have questions, the Internet is not the
place to ask them. Ask an attorney in your area.
