**Content:** [Certainly the technology is a good thing. It will help all
sides be better accountable.\
\
Just look at the introduction of dash-mounted vehicle recorders over the
past ten years. The number of complaints of police abuse plummeted when
complainants were confronted with the videos of their own police
contacts. The typical complaint in our department goes something like
this: sergeant and complainant sit down in interview room. Sergeant
takes complaint. Sergeant listens intently while complainant explains
how rude, disrespectful, racist, and abusive the officer was. Sergeant
offers to review the dash cam video with complainant. Dash cam video of
actual traffic stop shows officer being professional (if perhaps a
little bemused and possibly perturbed) at the rude, disrespectful,
racist and abusive complainant. Sergeant explains that it was actually
the complainant who was rude, but sergeant still offers to burn CD of
the incident for complainant that complainant can use as evidence in a
personal lawsuit if they so choose.\
\
Of course, not all traffic stops go this way. The worst ones end up on
TV. Which is all you manage to see these days.\
\
There are literally tens of millions of public interactions with police
every year. Only a handful are ever an issue. Yes, it\'s true, there are
some bad cops out there. There are bad people in every profession, since
all professions are made up of people, and all people are flawed in some
way. There are also bad politicians. Yet we don\'t ask them to wear body
cameras and film 100% of their business interactions on a daily basis.
We\'re not asking the mayor to wear a body camera. Or the President. And
he\'s accountable to everyone in the country. CEOs are only accountable
to their Boards of Directors and their shareholders, not the general
public. So while you might want more transparency into the boardroom,
you\'re not going to get it unless that CEO wants to give it to you. The
police, on the other hand, are public servants, so if the public wants
the police to wear body cameras, the police will wear body cameras.\
\
No one is being asked to be held to such a high standard in this
country. Why is this? It seems to be the cause *du jour* these days.
Police are public servants, like the President, but no one is asking the
President to wear a body camera. The military has hundreds of times the
firepower that the police have, plus they too are public servants, but
no one is asking them to wear body cameras. Something to think about.\
\
This will be great for eliminating corruption in the police department,
right? Because now we\'ll get to see everything the police officer sees.
It can\'t be anything but a good thing. Until something happens outside
of the field of view of the camera. Or something is too grainy to make
out on camera, or the action moves too fast, or the audio is distorted.
However, I suspect that even if you see it with your own eyes, you still
may not believe it. I suspect that even if Darren Wilson was wearing a
camera, people would still not believe that that white racist cop
didn\'t shoot a poor innocent unarmed black man in cold blood. What I
see as an issue here is that the people have used a few bad apples and
ruined the whole bushel. The people have lost faith that their public
servants are actually trustworthy. And that\'s a sad state of affairs.
The credibility of the police officer has been supplanted by the
credibility of the camera. If it\'s not on camera, it didn\'t happen,
they will say. What about the days when you took a man at his word?
Those days are long gone, as a few bad actors have ruined it for all of
us.\
\
I\'d like to see more incidents where police are vindicated by their
body cameras actually make the evening news. I\'d like to see cameras
that are sophisticated enough to capture everything. And I\'d like to
see less of an \"us vs them\" mentality among the general public when it
comes to police. I\'d also like to see a few more zeros at the end of my
balance in my bank account and a flying car sometime before I die. But
we can all keep dreaming, I guess.\

Thanks for the A2A, I hope I answered at least part of your
question.]{.rendered_qtext}
