**If you borrow a car from your friend and you did not return your
friend's car on time**

In other words, you had a verbal agreement and you didn't keep your end
of the agreement.

**and he calls 911 and reports it missing,**

which he has every right to do, except for that it's quite the dick
move. Obviously, he's more interested in getting his car back than
keeping his friend. Second, you don't report a car "missing" like a cat.
Cars don't wander off on their own. Cars are either in your possession
or they are not. That makes them "stolen." He would have to call 911 and
report a stolen car.

**can the court charge you for car theft if you get pulled over by
police and police arrest you and take you to jail?**

Most assuredly, yes. The owner of the car reported it stolen. That's not
a charge undertaken lightly. When the police stop you and tell you the
owner reported the car stolen and you tell them you had the owner's
permission, they'll tell you, "yeah sure, tell it to the judge" while
they arrest you. And when you tell the judge that you had permission to
borrow the car, but it was supposed to be returned on a certain day and
you failed to do so, your breaking of your agreement will not be taken
lightly.

Did you make any attempt to reach out to the owner in order to request
an extension on your borrowing? Even a text or a phone call? Anything?
Or did you just keep the car and assume that your friend would be cool
with it? You know what they say about what happens when you **assume:**
it makes an **ass** out of **u** and **me**.

Did you misunderstand the terms of the agreement? Or did you just decide
that since it was a verbal agreement, it was okay to break?

In any case, your day in court will probably not go exceedingly well for
you.
