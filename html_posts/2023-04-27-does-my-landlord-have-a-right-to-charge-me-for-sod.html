There are two parts to this question:

- Can your landlord charge you for the dead grass?
- Can the HOA fine you for the dead grass?

**1. Can your landlord charge you for the dead grass?**

Whether or not your landlord can charge you for the dead grass depends
on a lot of different factors, but primarily you will determine this by
looking at your lease. Check your lease to see if the lawn is included
in the "rental premises" or if the lease discusses the lawn at all. Some
leases only talk about the interior, in which case you may not be
responsible for the lawn.

Since you mentioned that there is a lawn maintenance company, lawn
maintenance should be mentioned in your lease. Details such as lawn
watering and plant maintenance should be included on the lease. If they
are not, you may not be responsible for the lawn.

Finally, to determine who is responsible for the dead grass, you will
need to determine the root cause for the lawn death. There are several
factors which are outside of your control, such as:

- Weather. If you did everything you were supposed to do but the lawn
  suffered because of extreme weather, you may not be responsible for
  the death.
- Pests. Bugs in the lawn are not your fault. If you fail to notify the
  landlord about the issue when you see it, however, you could be liable
  (we'll talk about that in a second).

But even if you are not responsible for maintaining the lawn, you are
responsible for notifying the landlord if you notice that problems do
exist. Failing to notify your landlord of problems you see could be
classified under **neglect**. If you find bugs in the lawn, or if you
notice the lawn is dying, it is your responsibility to notify the
landlord as soon as possible so they can fix the problem. Ensure that
you have some recorded communication (i.e. an email or text you sent
them, etc) showing you attempted to contact the landlord about issues
you found.

Or it is entirely possible that **you** caused the lawn to die. You may
have had something parked on the lawn, or you have a pet who damaged the
lawn with waste or digging. In those cases, you can be charged for the
lawn replacement.

**2. Can the HOA fine you for a dead lawn?**

The short answer is yes, the HOA can indeed charge the tenant for a dead
lawn, but usually the HOA charges the *homeowner* regardless of whether
or not they live in the house. Generally, the homeowner would pass those
fines on to the tenant if the tenant was actually responsible for
maintaining the lawn.

Check the Governing Documents for the HOA. It may indicate who is
responsible for maintaining the property (i.e. the owner or the tenant),
and who the HOA will fine for issues. If it does not, inform the HOA
that you are not responsible for maintaining the lawn. If they fine you
anyway, you will have to pass those fines on to the landlord. You can do
that by withholding the fine amount from your rent, but the landlord
would have to agree that you are not responsible for the lawn or the
fines. Communication with your landlord will be key.

If your landlord is not being cooperative, you may have to engage a real
estate attorney in your local area who specializes in property rental
law.
