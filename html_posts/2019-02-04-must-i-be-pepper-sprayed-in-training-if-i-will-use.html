**Must I be pepper sprayed in training, if I will use it as a police
officer?**

This is all dependent on department policy.

Most departments require that everything you carry on your duty belt be
trained and authorized by the department. If you carry pepper spray, you
will have to be trained on its use and authorized by the department.

Whether or not that training includes application of pepper spray on you
is up to your department.
