In law, we often say "The Supreme Court isn't the last word because
they're always right. The Supreme Court is always right because they're
the last word."

When the Supreme Court makes a ruling about a law, that ruling is final.
No one can overrule it except the Supreme Court. In the case of *Roe*,
the Supreme Court overruled itself and reversed a bad law.

*NOTE: Before you run to the comments, I said the* ***law*** *was bad. I
didn't say that the* ***subject*** ***of the law*** *was bad. Many
people wanted to keep the bad law around because they liked the outcome,
but that's not the right thing to do.*

However, you can *work around* it.

1.  Congress can rewrite the law in question so that it complies with
    the Constitution. Take out the parts that are flawed, or write it in
    such a way that it doesn't violate the Constitution. Or write a
    whole new law that will be broadly acceptable across the spectrum,
    not just a law that panders to your own political party. This is the
    primary way that you can "fix" a Supreme Court decision.
2.  When the Court says that there is no Constitutional protection for
    something (like abortion), the state can absolutely write their own
    laws and say that in that state, there is. And in roughly half of
    the country, states have provided some access to abortion.
3.  Amend the Constitution. Some states have amended their own state
    constitutions to enshrine a right to abortion in that state. And if
    you have as much public support behind an issue as you believe you
    do, it should be easy to get a supermajority of Congress and 3/4ths
    of the states to go along with your amendment.

People are wrongly blaming the courts for a situation created by
lawmakers. And it's a situation that lawmakers can fix, either at the
state level or at the national level.

And while you may not like the outcome that the Court reached, you can
always fix it at some level. In other words, if the Court was
egregiously wrong, there are still ways to work around that. That's why
the system is called "checks and balances." A runaway Supreme Court can
still be balanced by Congress and the states.
