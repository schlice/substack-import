**Did Mueller admit that Trump committed a felony during the recent
hearing?**

Initially it seemed that way, but Mueller corrected that statement that
made it seem like he did.

There were two hearings; one before the House Judiciary Committee, and
one before the House Intelligence Committee. In his first set of
testimony to the Judiciary Committee, the following exchange took place:

> LIEU: And I'd like to ask you the reason, again, that you did not
> indict Donald Trump is because of OLC opinion stating that you cannot
> indict a sitting president, correct?
>
> MUELLER: That is correct.

Later that same day, Mueller testified again to the Intelligence
Committee, and in his opening remarks, he said the following:

> MUELLER: Now before we go to questions, I want to add one correction
> to my testimony this morning. I want to go back to one thing that was
> said this morning by Mr. Lieu who said, and I quote, \"You didn\'t
> charge the President because of the OLC opinion." That is not the
> correct way to say it. As we say in the report, and as I said at the
> opening, we did not reach a determination as to whether the President
> committed a crime.

**Therefore, the reason that Mueller did not charge Trump with a crime
is because he did not reach a determination whether or not Trump
committed a crime.**
