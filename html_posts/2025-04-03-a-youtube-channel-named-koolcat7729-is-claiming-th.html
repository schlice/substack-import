Jesus doesn't even know when the rapture is going to happen. How
"Koolcat7729" thinks that he knows better than Jesus is beyond me.

Jesus explicitly said that no one but God knows:

> *"But concerning that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels
> of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only. \-- Matthew 24:36 ESV*

Revelation also speaks of many events which will take place before
Jesus' return, and it's a fair assumption that those things haven't
happened yet. Considering that those things are being measured in
*years*, and they haven't even begun yet, it's a fair bet that the
rapture is not happening in 12 days.
