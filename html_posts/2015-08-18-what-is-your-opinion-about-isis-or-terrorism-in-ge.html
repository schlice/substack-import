**Content:** [It is neither of the items you have cited. Specifically,
it is ***their*** interpretation of their religion that leads them to do
the things that they do. Most Muslim scholars will tell you that this is
not an \"exact\" interpretation of their religion. As with most
religions, the texts must be taken in context and as a whole.
Cherry-picking certain passages and using them to model your behavior is
a poor way to handle historical texts which must be read in context and
with the whole of the document in mind.\
\
Poor interpretation of religious texts has led to some very bad
consequences in the past. The Spanish Inquisition and the Crusades are
examples from the Roman Catholic church, so in my opinion, no religion
is immune from such invalid thought.]{.rendered_qtext}
