**Is watching anime on YouTube illegal?**

Let me help clear up a little confusion.

**Watching anything that is posted to YouTube is not illegal. If it's on
YouTube and you can open the video, it is perfectly legal for you to
watch it, unless your country or your state has some law against viewing
any particular content.**

Now that this is out of the way, the account which posted the video may
have done so in a way which violated the copyright of the owner of the
content, as well as YouTube's Terms of Service. So if anything at all
may be illegal, this would be it.

But if you can open the link and it exists, it is not illegal for you to
watch it. Yes, while it is true that you are not supposed to consume
illegally-posted content, when it comes to YouTube, the punishment is on
the account holder who posted the video, not the average person who
opened the video. In other words, it's not your responsibility to check
the copyright status of the video and whether or not the account holder
had permission to post it before you watch it.

That's why YouTube takes action against the account holder, not the
viewer.
