\
For me, a few reasons.\
\
My wife, who knows me better than I do, says that I have a \"servant\'s
heart.\" Everything that I have done in my life has been some form of
service. My military service was pretty obvious. After that, I went to
work for a computer company\...in customer service. And now, I am
working towards volunteering for the Sheriff\'s Office as a Reserve
Deputy.\
\
But why law enforcement? It\'s in my blood. My grandpa and my dad were
both cops. Once you have lived in a cop\'s family, it sorta \"grows\" on
you. And I\'ve already been a reserve cop before: I was a READY
Augmentee for Security Forces in the Air Force. I did really enjoy that
work.\
\
So I know it\'s not for the money, since Reserve Deputies don\'t get
paid. For me, I want to give back to my community in a tangible,
meaningful (to me) way. I can fulfill my dream of continuing my family
legacy in law enforcement and still provide the lifestyle my family has
come to expect. This is what I chose.\

(BTW, this is a portion of the presentation I gave at Oral Boards when I
was applying to the department).]{.rendered_qtext}
