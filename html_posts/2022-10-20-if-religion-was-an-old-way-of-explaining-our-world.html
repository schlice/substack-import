How the world was really made is not at issue. We all know how the world
was made. It was the Big Bang. That was the beginning of all time,
matter, and space. Everything in our known universe was created from
that one event.

But that begs the question: *what caused that?* This, by the way, is
what we call the Cosmological Argument:

1.  Everything that had a beginning had a cause.
2.  The universe (and everything in it) had a beginning.
3.  Therefore, the universe (and everything in it) had a cause.

Premise 1 is what we call the Law of Causality. It's *the* fundamental
principle of science. Without this, no scientific inquiry would be
possible. Science is a search for causes. That's what scientists do ---
try to determine what caused what. So Premise 1 is true.

Is Premise 2 true? We know that the Big Bang happened. Evidence for the
Big Bang is numerous, and growing. While there is still plenty of doubt
as to whether or not the Big Bang was actually the beginning of all
time, space, and matter, Einstein's Theory of General Relativity (which
relies on the fact that everything in the known universe all began at a
single point) has been proven to five decimal places, and has been the
source for other discoveries (red shift, galaxy seeds, etc).

Therefore, we know that something (or Someone) caused the universe to
come into existence.

Because that Someone exists outside of time and space, we cannot detect
that Someone using traditional scientific inquiry. You can't measure
God. You can't detect God's presence. But the Law of Causality says that
an effect must resemble its cause. So can we look at the effect and
infer anything about the cause?

In fact, we can. From looking at the creation (the universe), here's
what we can tell about the Creator:

- He must be supernatural in nature (as He created time and space).
- He must be powerful (incredibly).
- He must be necessary (the maker must be self-explanatory).
- He must be omnipresent (He created space and is not limited by it).
- He must be immaterial because He transcends space/physical.
- He must be personal (the impersonal cannot create personality).
- He must be infinite and singular as you cannot have two infinites.
- He must be diverse yet have unity as unity and diversity exist
  simultaneously in nature.
- He must be intelligent (supremely). Only cognitive being can produce
  cognitive being.
- He must be purposeful as He deliberately created everything.
- He must be moral (no moral law can be had without a giver).
- He must be caring (or no moral laws would have been given).

Interestingly, it is only the Abrahamic God of the Bible who fits these
requirements completely.

That's why we still devote our lives to religion. Because religion fits
the available evidence better than any other explanation out there.
There is more evidence to prove that religion is right than there is
that atheism is. Because there is *more evidence*, it requires *less*
*faith* to believe that there is a Creator than to believe that there is
not. And I just don't have enough faith to believe there is no Creator.

**TL;DR: We devote our lives to religion because we don't have enough
faith to be atheists.**

Original question:

If religion was an old way of explaining our world, and we now know how
it was really made, why do people still devote their lives to religion?
