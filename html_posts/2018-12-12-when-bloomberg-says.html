**When Bloomberg says "What I have asked for... are background checks,
we shouldn't be selling guns to minors, to people with psychiatric
problems, or people with criminal records", do they not realize these
are laws already ?**

For the most part, yes. The problem is they equivocate on the details.
Let's review:

**Minors**: Um, we don't sell guns to minors. My guess is the
equivocation here is what you consider a *minor*. You're no longer a
minor at 18 in the United States. However, we do restrict handgun sales
to 21 or older. Perhaps they want to universally impose a 21 year old
age limit for all gun sales. Some states say this is a Second Amendment
violation, and other states are already doing this. These cases will
soon be coming to the SCOTUS, with more and more cities and states
restricting all firearms sales to those 21 and older.

**Background checks**: You do know that there are many places you can
buy guns without a background check, right? It's called *private sales*.
Now, obviously this is legal and it is how the system was designed, but
they don't like it. They feel like it's an *end run* around the
background check system. When they say they want "universal background
checks," what they are really asking for is the elimination of the
private sale exception.

However, to do that means to expand the NICS system and allow access to
anyone. But that opens up a whole new can of worms, not the least of
which is how to pay for such a massive NICS upgrade. But typically of
those who espouse this particular gun control measure, they're
relatively unconcerned with where the money to upgrade NICS will come
from. The other significant NICS-for-all speedbump is the privacy issue,
which gets even worse when we get to the next point:

**People with psychiatric problems:** I think we can all agree that we
don't want the criminally insane to be able to purchase firearms, and
currently they can't. However, they contend, most of the mass shooters
did not violate any current laws and, they argue, probably had mental
issues. Their issue is that we're not doing *enough*.

But that, of course, poses immense new problems, the elephant in the
room being *what constitutes a psychiatric problem*? I was diagnosed
with depression about 10 years back. I'm better now. Do I lose my gun
rights? What about veterans who require financial assistance? [[They've
already been denied gun
rights](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=333dc6&url=https://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/defense/295484-va-is-restricting-veterans-gun-rights-without-due-process){.external_link

qt-tooltip="thehill.com"}]{.qlink_container}! That's right, if you
requested fiduciary assistance from the VA, they are similarly claiming
that you are not mentally capable of owning a gun. The arbitrary and
capricious application of labels is a major concern, and without a major
overhaul of the mental health evaluation system in this country, will be
amazingly difficult to implement fairly. Also of note is the privacy
concerns mentioned in the first bullet. Health information is protected
by HIPAA. You can't publish that kind of thing in a database which is
open to the public, but we want people to be able to use NICS before
they engage in a private sale. This will require a complete overhaul of
NICS, from the ground up.

Illinois' FOID card system is not a bad way to go. You are investigated
once, and if you are allowed to own a firearm, you receive a card, with
a number. Any time a potential firearms sale is to occur, the card is
validated. A simple website where you enter the FOID card number and you
receive a YES or NO response based on your NICS eligibility is all you
need to confirm the purchaser is still valid. That transaction against
that FOID card would be logged, and you'd get a confirmation number.
Keeping the confirmation number along with the bill of sale would be all
that is necessary for record keeping (i.e. I saw the FOID card, I
confirmed it was valid, so I made the sale). Now you have universal
background checks, and they are divorced from the actual transaction of
the firearm. It will cost money to revamp the system and issue everyone
eligible a FOID card, but it can be done. Perhaps we could leverage the
Social Security Administration or at a local level, the DMV, to assist
with getting those cards issued.

**People with criminal records:** Today, violent felons lose their right
to firearms, but I guess that doesn't go far enough either. The
question, of course, is what exactly does this mean? Is it only violent
felonies? We have that today. Is it domestic violence? We also have that
today. Is it shoplifting? Is it jaywalking? What crimes, exactly, should
we restrict Constitutional rights once you commit them?
