What surprises **me** is that Britons are willing to accept that unarmed
officers should have no personal ability to defend themselves against
armed assailants, regardless of how good their hand-to-hand skills may
be. While I've worked as a US police officer, I would never personally
volunteer to be an unarmed officer, ever. I applaud, and am in continual
awe of, the work [[Adey
Hill](https://www.quora.com/profile/Adey-Hill)]{.qlink_container} and
his comrades do every day, and we in the US are saddened and horrified
by their loss, but being a PC in the UK is not a job you'd be able to
get me to do.

Yes, in America, individual liberty is paramount. We have **guaranteed
individual rights** which the government cannot infringe upon. Even for
the collective good.

In our view, collective welfare is socialism. The United States
government ***promotes the general welfare***, but does not
***provide*** it.

And we like it just fine that way.
