If you are asking whether or not the company is actually sitting there
reading your IMs, then likely not.

But are they *monitoring* your IMs? Probably.

If they are smart, they monitor ***all*** traffic in and out of the
network. They have automated systems that look for *keywords* that might
indicate company sensitive information is leaving the network.

You using a company network to IM implies your consent to such
monitoring.
