**Content:** [Basically, everyone of any particular rank and time in
service is paid the same. You can look up the military officer pay scale
online. It changes annually with COLA (Cost Of Living Allowance)
changes.\
\
Your degree would probably cause you to be placed in a specific AFSC
(Air Force Speciality Code), which is your job function. Your job
function may have certain extra pay categories, and potential bonuses.\
\
Talk to your recruiter to get more specifics about what job you would
likely be doing and what bonuses or extra pay are
offered.]{.rendered_qtext}
