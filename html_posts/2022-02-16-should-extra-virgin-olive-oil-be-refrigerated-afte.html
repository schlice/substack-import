No, refrigeration is not recommended. Like all vegetable oils, olive oil
can be stored in a cool, dark place. It shouldn't be too warm, because
that could cause the oil to begin to oxidize and it will go rancid
faster (we'll talk about rancid EVOO in a minute). But it shouldn't be
refrigerated either, because that causes crystals to form and start to
solidify. Bringing it back to room temperature will return the oil to
its liquid state. According to the [[North American Olive Oil
Association](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ea12d8&url=https://www.aboutoliveoil.org/should-olive-oil-be-stored-in-the-refrigerator){.external_link

found that repeatedly chilling and warming your oil may reduce its shelf
life and puts stress on the oil. Besides, it's really inconvenient to
have to warm your oil before you use it.

That said, it has a shelf life, even if it is a pretty good one. Most
olive oils can last about 18--24 months from the time they are bottled.
EVOO is maybe a little less, like 12--18 months. After that time, your
oil will go rancid. As

qt-tooltip="healthline.com"}]{.qlink_container} states, "You'll know
your olive oil has gone rancid by giving it a taste. It may taste bitter
or sour and smell a bit like crayons or putty. While it won't make you
sick, it may ruin your recipe." Keep an eye on the "Best By" date on
your bottle - it will show you when it's probably getting close to the
time to discard your old oil.

Speaking of EVOO and refrigeration, there was a myth running around for
a while (perpetuated by Dr. Oz on his TV show) that you could tell the
quality of your EVOO by putting it in the fridge. He claimed that poorer
quality oil would solidify in the fridge while good quality oil would
not. However, after his show, researchers at the [[UC Davis Olive
Center](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9e1dde&url=http://olivecenter.ucdavis.edu/){.external_link

qt-tooltip="ucdavis.edu"}]{.qlink_container} tested the theory and found
that the fridge test is "unreliable in judging whether an olive oil is
truly made from olives, nor does it provide information on the quality
of the oil." The more you know...
