If the goal of rape was to forcefully produce a child against the
mother's will, then I could see how you could conflate pro-life with
pro-rape.

**But rape isn't about making babies. Rape is about** ***power*.**

It's about having complete power over your victim, including their
sexual choices. Sure, in some cases, it's some incel who went nutz, but
even in that case, it's still an exertion of control over another
person. It's never about the baby.

But here's the thing: **the baby is an innocent victim, too, just as
much as the woman is**. Why do we take out our anger on the innocent
baby?

Did you know that a little over half of rape victims *actually keep
their babies?* From the way this question is worded, it sounds virtually
automatic that if you're a rape victim, you kill your baby, and anyone
who is pro-life is therefore pro-rape. Not all rape victims kill their
babies.

As a pro-life person, let me tell you where abortion makes sense:
**incest.** When a power dynamic in a family was abused and there is a
father-daughter pregnancy, abortion makes scientific and physiological
sense, considering that there is a better than 50% chance that the baby
will be born with a debilitating birth defect. Now, that doesn't mean I
think families should go hog-wild with their kids and then you should
just feel free to abort the trash you create. There are still serious
psychological impacts from parents having sex with their children. But
when it happens (and that's actually sexual assault as well as incest),
that baby shouldn't be forced to suffer just so that I can maintain
moral consistency. That makes no logical sense. Sometimes, morals need
to bend to common sense and common decency. Sometimes. Not in all cases,
but sometimes.
