The Supreme Court did not declare the land was stolen, and claims that
the court found that the US illegally took the land are most definitely
incorrect.

The land was given to the Sioux under the Fort Laramie Treaty. Then in
1877, the portion of land around Mount Rushmore and the Black Hills was
taken back under eminent domain, which is legal under the Constitution.
However, the 1877 treaty failed to properly categorize this as a
"taking" which would require just compensation. Instead, the 1877 treaty
which took the Black Hills offered "subsistence rations for as long as
they would be needed."

The Supreme Court decision in 1980 in *United States v. Sioux Nation of
Indians* (448 US 371, 1980) found that through the various machinations
over the years, the acquisition of the Black Hills was, in fact, a
"taking" under eminent domain, and that just compensation was due to the
Sioux, and that subsistence rations were not appropriate under the
compensation clause of eminent domain. The court found that the Sioux
were due \$17.1 million for the land. They then found that this taking
was also subject to interest payments, which they had not figured in the
1942 and 1987 claims. This amounts to a grand total of \$108 million due
to the Sioux Nation.

The Sioux still believe that the Fort Laramie Treaty was violated and
are claiming that their right to own the Black Hills has remained since
the original treaty. Regardless, the Supreme Court has ruled several
times on this issue, and some claims have been barred by *res judicata.*
According to the Courts, the taking of the Black Hills was
constitutional under eminent domain. Just as any other American, the
Sioux are entitled to just compensation for the taking. Because they
"didn't want to sell the land" is not relevant. The \$108 million
continues to be held in trust until the Sioux take the money.

**TL;DR: The United States is able to take land from citizens under the
Constitutional provision known as "eminent domain."**
