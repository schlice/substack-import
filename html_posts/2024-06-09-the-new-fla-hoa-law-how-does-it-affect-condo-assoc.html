The new law (HB 1203) appears to be written towards only homeowner's
associations. We will have to see when the law is signed where it ends
up in Florida Statutes. I suspect it will become part of 720, which is
the section of law regarding homeowner's associations.

To that end, here's what the new bill will do:

> The bill relates to the governance of homeowners' associations and the
> practice of the community association managers who manage those
> communities.
>
> ***Community Association Managers***
>
> Regarding community association managers (CAMs) and CAM firms, the
> bill requires CAMs and CAM firms to:
>
> - Annually attend at least one member meeting or board meeting of the
>   association;
> - Provide to community association members certain information,
>   including the contact person, contact information, and the hours of
>   availability;
> - Provide the community's members upon request a copy of the contract
>   between the association and the CAM or CAM firm;
> - Annualy complete at least 10 hours of continuing education; and
> - Biennially complete at least five hours of continuing education that
>   pertains to homeowners' associations, three hours of which must
>   relate to recordkeeping.
>
> ***Official Records***
>
> The bill requires homeowners' associations to:
>
> - Effective January 1, 2026, associations with 100 or more parcels,
>   maintain a digital copy of specified official records for download
>   on the association's website or through an application on a mobile
>   device.
> - Provide a copy of records or otherwise make the records available
>   that are subpoenaed by a law enforcement agency within five days of
>   receiving a subpoena.
> - Maintain official records for at least seven years, unless the
>   governing documents of the association require a longer period of
>   time.
>
> ***Criminal Violations***
>
> The bill provides the following criminal penalties related to
> homeowners' associations:
>
> - Second degree misdemeanor for any director or member of the board or
>   association to knowingly, willfully, and repeatedly violate (two or
>   more violations within a 12-month period) any specified requirements
>   relating to inspection and copying of official records of an
>   association with the intent of causing harm to the association or
>   one or more of its members;
> - First degree misdemeanor for knowingly and intentionally defacing or
>   destroying required accounting records, or knowingly and
>   intentionally failing to create or maintain required accounting
>   records, with the intent of causing harm to the association or one
>   or more of its members;
> - Third degree felony to willfully and knowingly refuse to release or
>   otherwise produce association records, with the intent to avoid or
>   escape detection, arrest, trial, or punishment for the commission of
>   a crime, or to assist another person with such avoidance or escape;
>   and
> - Third degree felony for an officer, director, or manager of a
>   condominium association to knowingly solicit, offer to accept, or
>   accept a kickback.
>
> The bill also expands the current criminal prohibitions against
> fraudulent voting activity to provide it is a first degree misdemeanor
> for:
>
> - Knowingly aiding, abetting, or advising a person in the commission
>   of a fraudulent voting activity related to association elections.
> - Agreeing, conspiring, combining, or confederating with at least one
>   other person to commit a fraudulent voting activity related to
>   association elections.

>   association elections and giving any aid to the offender with intent
>   that the offender avoid or escape detection, arrest, trial, or
