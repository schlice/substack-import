I'm sure you will get some juicy answers to this one, but I want to
share the one that sticks out with me. My training sergeant told us this
on day one of the academy.

*Nobody becomes a cop to be loved.*

If you want to be loved, be a firefighter. Cops are either regarded with
skepticism at best, or outright disdain and hatred at worst.

*Why?*

Because **police officers remind you that there are consequences to your
actions.**

If you're okay with being viewed skeptically at best, and with hostility
at worst, everywhere you go, then maybe police work is for you.

And after a *long* while of slogging it out in the soup, you *might* be
able to make a difference in someone's life.

I know, not painting a very glamorous picture, am I? Well, for the most
part, it's not. Long hours, not the best clientele, time away from your
family, working almost every holiday, etc.

But it is very personally rewarding work, if you are the type of person
who is energized by providing some small service to others. For them,
the promise that you are making a difference in some small way is
extremely appealing. It's the same mindset that makes someone a good
military member, which is why you see a lot of former military personnel
in police work.
