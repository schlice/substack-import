**What is the process for holding sheriffs who refuse to enforce state
law accountable? Can elected sheriffs only be removed by the people?**

In most cases, you will have to wait for the next election cycle to
remove a sheriff. Very few states have recall or impeachment processes
for the position of sheriff. You will have to check with the laws in
your state to see if there is a process for removing a sheriff from
office.

As your article mentions though, law enforcement has broad discretion
when determining when to enforce a particular law. The problem arises,
of course, when a sheriff opposes a law for political or ideological
reasons and makes those reasons into policy for his department. This is
where discretion collides head on with politics, but ultimately it comes
down to elections and state laws.

If enough people disagree with the sheriff's politics, perhaps a new
sheriff can be elected.
