While I can appreciate what you\'re trying to do, this entire question
is a logical fallacy called a **false equivalence.** The things you are
trying to compare are not even remotely similar.

Good try, but I\'m not taking the bait.

I will tell you that even those who you label killers can really only
kill someone who is alive. And if there is no sign of life in that
zygote (no brain activity, no heartbeat) is it really anything more than
*potential* life? In a balanced position, aborting that zygote would not
equate to murder.
