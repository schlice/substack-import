The media hype definitely makes it seem like there is a shooting around
every corner. There are two different questions here: **gunshots** and
**violent people.**\
\
**Gunshots.** In actuality, the vast majority of police officers have
only ever discharged their firearms in the firing range. Most officers
have never discharged their weapons outside of the range. They may draw
them on occasion (probably more often than they\'d like), but rarely
does an officer ever fire shots.\
\
**Violent people.** Officers have to deal with violent people all the
time. Sadly, combative people are more and more common. Rarely do they
have to resort to using their firearm to handle those violent people.
Officers have a \"force continuum\" of increasingly more powerful force
which culminates with the officer\'s sidearm. The officer has most (if
not all) of the following tools in that continuum of force:\

- His hands
- A baton
- Pepper spray
- a Taser
- a sidearm

He can employ any of these methods of force depending on the level of
violence with which he is confronted. Officers are generally allowed to
use one level of force greater than the threat being proffered. So if a
subject is combative but empty-handed, an officer can use his own empty
hands, or his baton, or pepper spray, or his Taser. A combative subject
wielding a stabbing weapon (i.e. knife or screwdriver) will be facing
the barrel of a gun. For offenders not wielding a weapon, the Taser is
becoming the go-to control method.
