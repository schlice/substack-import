**What would you say or do if your boss said you had the option to quit
or be fired?**

It depends on why you're being fired.

If you're being fired for cause, you should quit. If you're fired for
cause, not only will it make it harder for you to get another job, but
you won't be able to collect unemployment in most states.

If you're being fired without cause, let them fire you and collect
unemployment.
