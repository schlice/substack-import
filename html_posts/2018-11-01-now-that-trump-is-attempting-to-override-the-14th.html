**Now that Trump is attempting to override the 14th Amendment with an
executive order, will the 22nd be next?**

Question begins with a false premise.

No one is overriding any Amendments.

If Trump does anything (which is questionable), he will issue an
Executive Order which defines how to interpret the 14th Amendment, since
the Congress nor the Courts have ever ruled on how that Amendment
applies to **illegal aliens**. The Court has ruled how it applies to
citizens, to African Americans, to Native Americans, and to lawful
permanent residents (LPRs, or Green Card holders). But the court has
never ruled on how the 14th Amendment applies to illegal aliens.

We have been following an assumption for the last 30--40 years or so.

The President can issue an Executive Order which clarifies how Executive
Branch departments (including the USCIS) interprets the 14th Amendment.
He can dictate that all Executive Departments interpret the 14th
Amendment to not apply to illegal aliens.

What will happen after that:

- Someone will immediately request an injunction (my money is on the 9th
  Circus to issue that) halting the execution of that Executive Order,
  claiming that it violates the 14th Amendment.
- The injunction will be appealed to the SCOTUS to decide how the 14th
  Amendment should be interpreted when it comes to illegal aliens.
