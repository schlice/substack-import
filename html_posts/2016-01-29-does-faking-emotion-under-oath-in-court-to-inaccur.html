Generally, no.

Perjury means \"willfully telling an untruth.\" Emotions do not
generally tell truth or untruth very well, and are often subject to
interpretation. Therefore, perjury is more specifically focused on facts
related to questions you are asked.

You can be as much of a drama queen as you like on the stand. If it
sways the jury, all\'s the better. But it\'s not a lie to fake emotion.
