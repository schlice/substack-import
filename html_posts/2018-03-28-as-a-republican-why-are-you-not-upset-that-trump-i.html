**As a Republican, why are you not upset that Trump is doing nothing to
safeguard future elections from foreign interference?**

What "foreign interference" are you referring to? Are you referring to
Russians who bought ads on Facebook? Because that's the only
"interference" that has been proven.

And seriously, if you were a Hillary voter, saw an ad on Facebook, and
switched your vote to Trump, I want to find the guy who made that ad,
because I have some products to sell...
