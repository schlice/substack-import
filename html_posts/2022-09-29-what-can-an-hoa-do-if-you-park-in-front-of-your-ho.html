The answer is "it depends."

First, it depends on the restrictions on parking you may have in your
Governing Documents. Next, it depends on whether or not you live in a
gated community.

If your HOA's Governing Documents has a rule which states that you may
not park in front of your house, then you may not park in front of your
house. If you do park in front of your house in violation of your
Governing Documents, the HOA can take action.

The action they can take will depend on whether or not your HOA is
gated.

- If you live in a gated community, then the HOA owns the roads and can
  enforce parking using *physical* methods: they can tow your car, or
  they can boot your car until you pay a fine, depending on what your
  Governing Documents say.
- If you do not live in a gated community, the HOA can only fine you for
  violating the Governing Documents.

In either case, if you do not pay the fines, the HOA can put a lien on
your house to cover the unpaid fines, and if the amount gets high enough
(which is usually specified by state law), the HOA can foreclose on that
lien and sell your house out from under you to pay for the money they
are owed.

In short, not following your HOA's rules can indeed become very legally
troublesome for you.

If you don't like the HOA's rules, you can either work to change them,
or you can sell your house and move to a community with better rules, or
no HOA and no rules at all.
