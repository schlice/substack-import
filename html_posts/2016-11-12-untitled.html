Unheard of in US history.

There is nothing in the Constitution to account for such a situation.
Perhaps Congress would vote for President, which is what would happen if
neither candidate got to 270 electoral votes.

But how would that look? Congress invalidates the electoral vote, then
Congress elects a President?

Massive Constitutional crisis.
