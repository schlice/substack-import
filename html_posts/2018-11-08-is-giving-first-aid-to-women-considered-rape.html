**Is giving first aid to women considered rape?**

First Aid: Providing immediate, life-saving treatment to control
bleeding, ensure unimpeded breathing, and prevent further serious injury
due to broken bones or other injuries, until medical support arrives.

Rape: A form of sexual assault usually defined as sexual intercourse or
other forms of sexually-related penetration without consent.

This isn't just apples and oranges, it's apples and cars. It's like two
totally different things. I can't even in my wildest imagination see how
they could be related.
