Police officers are indeed allowed to lie to suspects during
interrogations. About the only line that exists in police interrogation
is making threats. The police cannot threaten you with bodily harm, but
the line between an unlawful threat and a permitted police interrogation
tactic are far from clear.

Police often use the "[[Reid
technique](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=58766d&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_technique){.external_link

qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}" which is sometimes
colloquially referred to as "Good Cop/Bad Cop." While it is mostly
embellished by Hollywood, the Reid interrogation technique is
surprisingly effective at eliciting actual, lawful confessions, and has
been used for over 70 years.

> The Reid technique\'s nine steps of interrogation are:
>
> 1.  Positive confrontation. Advise the suspect that the evidence has
>     led the police to the individual as a suspect. Offer the person an
>     early opportunity to explain why the offense took place.
> 2.  Try to shift the blame away from the suspect to some other person
>     or set of circumstances that prompted the suspect to commit the
>     crime. That is, develop themes containing reasons that will
>     psychologically justify or excuse the crime. Themes may be
>     developed or changed to find one to which the accused is most
>     responsive.
> 3.  Try to minimize the frequency of suspect denials.
> 4.  At this point, the accused will often give a reason why he or she
>     did not or could not commit the crime. Try to use this to move
>     towards the acknowledgement of what they did.
> 5.  Reinforce sincerity to ensure that the suspect is receptive.
> 6.  The suspect will become quieter and listen. Move the theme of the
>     discussion toward offering alternatives. If the suspect cries at
>     this point, infer guilt.
> 7.  Pose the \"alternative question\", giving two choices for what
>     happened; one more socially acceptable than the other. The suspect
>     is expected to choose the easier option but whichever alternative
>     the suspect chooses, guilt is admitted. There is always a third
>     option which is to maintain that they did not commit the crime.
> 8.  Lead the suspect to repeat the admission of guilt in front of
>     witnesses and develop corroborating information to establish the
>     validity of the confession.
> 9.  Document the suspect\'s admission or confession and have him or
>     her prepare a recorded statement (audio, video or
>     written).[\[1\]](#CZNlm){#cite-CZNlm .citation_link}
