When I left the Catholic church, I first became a United Methodist. The
Methodist church (at the time) was very rote and formulaic with their
services, but still espoused the Nicene Creed, so the transition away
from Catholicism was actually fairly easy.

But as others have said, just be ready for other Protestants to have
mixed (sometimes visceral) reactions to Catholic doctrines and
teachings. You can remind them that you don't believe those things,
hence the reason you left, so that they might settle down with that.

Other than that, know that you are doing what you are doing because
something told you that Catholicism is not what you believe. Follow that
truth. Study the Bible. Deepen your relationship with God. Create that
*personal* relationship that is not stressed in the Catholic church. And
remember that rituals don't save you. Eating or drinking doesn't save
you. **Only repentance and belief in Christ** saves you.
