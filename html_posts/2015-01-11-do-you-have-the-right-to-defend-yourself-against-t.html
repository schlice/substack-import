**Content:** [The example you gave said that the police were
commandeering your home because a crime was being committed next door.
The legal principle which allows the police to do this is what is known
as \"exigent circumstances.\" For example, let\'s assume that your
neighbor was making pipe bombs next door and had amassed over 100 active
bombs. The police could remove you from your home (forcibly, if need be)
for your own safety, because they would be doing a disservice to leave
you there simply because you refused to go. You could be placed into
\"protective custody\" for your own safety. Exigent circumstances means
that the police are allowed to enter your home, without your permission,
to prevent imminent danger to life or damage to property. This doesn\'t
mean that the police have the right to then search your home and arrest
you if they find a bag of weed in the toilet tank; plain-view and
warrant rules still apply.\
\
If the police claim exigent circumstances but are illegally acting, you
can, after the conclusion of the incident, file lawsuit against the
police department for unlawfully commandeering your property, or
unlawfully claiming exigent circumstances.\
\
You cannot \"force\" the police to stay out of your home if they claim
exigent circumstances exist. You can only hope to go back following the
incident and prove that no such circumstances existed. You cannot do
this at the scene.\
\
As many of us have said over many similar questions, there are many
legal remedies if the police act outside the law. NONE of these remedies
take place AT THE SCENE or DURING THE INCIDENT. ALWAYS comply with the
police, and then use the legal system to make your family and your
children and grandchildren independently wealthy at the city\'s
expense.]{.rendered_qtext}
