**Is the police required to investigate all burglar alarms or are there
some neighborhoods where they don\'t have to respond to them?**

The police are under no specific legal requirement to do anything,
except to enforce the law. What does "enforce the law" mean? That means
if a person breaks a law, the police ensure that whatever the punishment
is that is listed in that law, the person is brought to a judge to see
if they will be given that punishment.

That's it. That's what the police are required to do, by law.

They do all the rest when they have time, when there aren't shootings
and drunk drivers and rioters that they have to deal with. They fill
their time answering *calls for service*.

And with the number of false positives with burglar alarms, the priority
for unverified burglar alarms is really low, if they get to it at all.

Note that priorities in some departments are different. Some departments
may classify some alarms differently. But you didn't ask about that, you
asked what police are required to do.

*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.
Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a
civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not
misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously. My mental well-being
isn\'t worth your harassing, inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I
wrote, tough shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is
un-cited opinion masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m
wrong, write your own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site,
not a debate site. If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually,
you\'re wrong,\" don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment.
Put anything vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be
followed by a block and a mute. I will do this immediately and with no
compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*
