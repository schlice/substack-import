**Now that charges have been dropped against Jussie Smollett can
conservatives finally admit that their demonization of him was a rush to
judgement?**

Oh lord, no.

You see, questioner, "dropping charges" does not mean "innocent." It
doesn't even mean "not guilty."

It simply means the state is not going to exert the effort (and taxpayer
dollars) needed to prosecute the crime.

In this situation, one of two things may have happened:

- Either the prosecution discovered a defect in their case, perhaps
  something in the background of the witnesses or the defendant that
  would make their prosecution problematic
- or they simply decided to perform what is known as ***deferred
  prosecution***. In Chicago, there is no requirement to plead guilty in
  a case of deferred prosecution.

We will probably never know which one of these two things actually
happened. But while this crime was a travesty, there was no violence,
there was no injury to anyone else (except for the alleged emotional
injury to Smollett), and prosecutors could have simply used their
discretion to drop the charges and not prosecute the case.

Or someone could have gotten to them. Someone with great political
power. Someone with Hollywood connections. And asked them, in the nicest
way possible, to maybe not bother with this case. With all the implied
force behind that "nice" request.

The truth is, we can speculate all day long, but we'll never know
exactly why they decided to drop their case.
