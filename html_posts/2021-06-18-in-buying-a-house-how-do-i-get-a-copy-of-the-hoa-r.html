Depends on the state. In some states, the Rules and Regulations
documents do not need to be filed with the city or county, so it would
be up to the HOA to get those to you. In others, the Rules and
Regulations must be filed with the county or city, and you can get it
from them.

The quickest and easiest way would be to make a request to the HOA
themselves (easiest way is to visit the HOA's website), or if you're
having difficulty with that, ask your realtor for assistance.
