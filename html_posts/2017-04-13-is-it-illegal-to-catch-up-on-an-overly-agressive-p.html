Police takedowns look inherently violent. They look aggressive. They
look painful. In some respects, they are intended to look this way. They
present an image of force, an image of control. They are designed to
remove the threat, which is not so much physical. The threat is
*mental*. A person who has the will to resist will continue to resist.
Once that person has mentally decided that it is not in his best
interest to resist, then he will stop.

But that action looks very aggressive. What you may see as a "brutal
arrest" is in fact a lawful takedown procedure, executed correctly, and
when performed correctly, stops the aggressor without causing excessive
physical harm (there may be some minor cuts and bruises, but no major
broken bones, no internal damage, etc) **and** convinces the aggressor
that continuing in his resistance will not net him any additional gain.
*That's* the big victory: getting the aggressor to *believe* that he
should not continue being aggressive.

And that's only the beginning, as we have only discussed appearances
here.

Legally, you have no authority to intervene when a police officer is
carrying out his lawful duties. "But a brutal arrest isn't lawful!" you
may say. It may be lawful, it may not be lawful. The only entity in the
United States which has the legal authority to decide whether or not it
is lawful is a court of law. Not you, not the police officer, not the
suspect. Only the court. It's up to the police to get the suspect into
custody and in front of a court so it can make that determination.

*So what can you do?*

Your best option is not to intervene. Your best option is to **record
everything you see**. If you don't have a phone that can record video,
**be a good witness**. Remember everything you can, in as much detail as
you can. Remember to answer the who/what/when/where/why questions when
you are focusing on remembering what was happening.
