**Why do people keep saying that Hillary was the first woman nominated
by a major party when it was Shirley Chisholm?**

Clinton was nominated by the Democratic Party as the candidate for the
Presidency in 2016.

Chisholm ran for the Democratic Party's nomination, but did not receive
it. She may have potentially won a primary, but she did not secure the
Democratic party's nomination in 1972.
