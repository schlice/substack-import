While the Bible doesn't specifically mention this, we do know that God
keeps a record of sins and for those who have not repented and turned to
Christ as savior, they will be held to account for all of their sins.

> Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God,
> for it is written, "Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord."
> \-- Romans 12:19 ESV

More likely than not, this punishment will not take place during our
lifetimes, or during their lifetime, either. This punishment will take
place at the day of judgement, when we all stand before the throne of a
sovereign God and He reviews the record of our sins. Remember though,
only those who have repented and have accepted Christ as our savior can
be assured that His sacrifice pays for our sins.

Remember too that **if those who have hurt and betrayed us** ***truly
sought repentance and were saved*, then they too are covered by the
blood of Christ.** If you read that last sentence and felt anger that
this person might not suffer for what they have done, then you must
examine your own heart and see what it is that you desire. Because if a
person can be saved by the blood of Christ and you feel like "justice
was not served," then you want vengeance ***for yourself***. You want a
pound of flesh for what was done to you.

You must realize that this is not a problem of theirs, but is instead a
problem of yours.

If you feel this way, you must let go of those feelings. God will repay,
not you. You are not commanded to repay. You are commanded to love and
forgive. Jesus talked about it during His famed Sermon on the Mount:

> "You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a
> tooth.' But I say to you, Do not resist the one who is evil. But if
> anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. And
> if anyone would sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak
> as well. And if anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two
> miles. Give to the one who begs from you, and do not refuse the one
> who would borrow from you. \-- Matthew 5:38--42 ESV

So it feels like God is telling us that we must let this need for
vengeance go. Vengeance is for God, not for us. This is hard for us to
do, and we can't do it without Him. If you feel this way, bring these
concerns to God, who knows what you need even before you ask Him for it.
But ask Him anyway; He wants to hear you say it. He wants you to lean on
Him for your needs. Have Him help you work through this pain and
forgive. And if punishment is due, rest assured that God will take
revenge on the last day.
