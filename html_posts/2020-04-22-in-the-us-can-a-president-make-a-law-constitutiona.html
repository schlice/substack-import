**In the US, can a president make a law (constitutional or
unconstitutional)? If yes, what is the role of the Congress? Isn't it
the job of the president of the US only to execute laws?**

In the US, the president does not make law. Congress makes laws. The
president and his agencies execute and enforce laws.

You may be confused with Executive Orders. These are orders the
president makes to his own Executive Branch agencies for how to enforce
*existing* law. They do not create *new* law, and when it happens, the
laws are generally overturned. The most recent example of this is the
DACA program which President Obama enacted via Executive Order. This
program will likely be found to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court
this summer.
