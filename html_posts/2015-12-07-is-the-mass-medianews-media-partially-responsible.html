It is well-known that several of the recent high school and college
shooters idolized and tried to emulate the Columbine shooters Dylan
Klebold and Eric Harris. Their memoirs, Facebook posts and other social
media indicated their admiration for the pair\'s bravery and their
desire to go out just as big.

Indeed, limiting \"air time\" for the shooters, large-scale demonization
of actual shooters, and reduction of other mass media coverage of
shootings, could go a long way to showing these shooters that their \"15
minutes of fame\" will actually be closer to \"15 seconds.\"
