**Content:** [[[Adey

assessment of issues with TV and UK policing are very similar to the
issues we have with TV and US policing.\
\
Most US TV police dramas depict police officers and detectives taking
great liberties with Constitutional rights, depicting police
organizations as highly political and highly corrupt, and the only way
that justice can be served is when line-level cops or squad-level
detectives break the rules to make it happen.\
\
Also, the whole \"drop your gun\" thing is completely untrue. I really
dislike that one, and I appreciate the shows that \"do it right\" and
show the cop not dropping his/her gun. Cops don\'t drop their guns for
anything.\
\
The image of the \"rogue cop\" who spends his career at odds with
everyone in the unit is a popular one in movies and TV, and it\'s about
as far from reality as you can get. Tolerance for that sort of behavior
is exceedingly limited in real life.\
\
Even \"reality-based TV\" shows like \"Cops\" are highly flawed because
of the way they are edited. There is a great deal of very important
interaction which is conveniently left out of the TV show due to the
constraints of time and format.\
\
Now, on the other hand, if there is any show at all that you should
watch to get a fairly decent idea what a detective\'s life looks like,
watch \"The First 48\" on A&E. That\'s about as close to reality as
you\'re going to get on TV.\
\
However, unlike the UK, police officers in the US are allowed to lie to
suspects in order to get them to talk. A common interrogation technique
is separating two suspects and then turning them against each other,
saying that the other already gave them the whole story \"and they
pinned it all on you, so we don\'t need to question you.\" This, of
course, infuriates the suspect being questioned, who usually says one of
two things: \"No way, my boy would never roll on me,\" or \"WHAT? It was
all HIS idea! Why would he even say that? The rat bastard!\" (Of course,
the usual coarse stream of expletives has been removed to protect your
eyes).\
\
\<EDIT\> I didn\'t mention shows like the \"CSI\" franchise because they
are all completely and totally made-up from start to finish. There\'s no
attempt at all to portray reality in any way.]{.rendered_qtext}
