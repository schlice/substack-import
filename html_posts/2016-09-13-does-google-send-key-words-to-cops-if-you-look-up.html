Short answer: **no**.

Longer answer: If the police came to Google with a warrant and said
"Please give us the search history for the following IP address:
1.2.3.4", Google would turn over everything they had for that IP
address.

*It doesn't work the other way around.*

Google doesn't voluntarily hand information over to anyone, let alone
police, terrorism task forces, Interpol, or anyone else. Go to them with
a warrant, and you will get whatever information they have. But they're
not in the business of busily handing over IP information on every
keyword search that looks threatening. Google is a *business*. They're
not around for public benefit. Yes, they provide a service, and a good
one at that. That's why they make the money they do. But don't kid
yourself, they're not the altruistic organization many make them out to
be. They're a business, out to make money. As much money as they can
legally make. Turning information directly over to the police, without
them asking, doesn't make them any money. They are under no affirmative
requirement to inform the police about any keyword searches. They are
not a law enforcement agency.

If you're concerned about Internet privacy, you should look in to how to
conceal your identity online. Please take a few minutes and learn more
about what you can do to protect yourself online. Check out

Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). Now why would you do that? If you
had nothing to hide, why bother?

Because in theory, *they have no right to know what I'm doing, it's
supposed to be private.* They *shouldn't ever look in the first place.*
That said, the very fact that this question is being asked means that no
one trusts anyone, especially the government. So I'm not hiding my
information from police. I'm hiding it from people that have no right to
see it in the first place. I'm not doing anything illegal. That doesn't
give you the right to spy on me without a warrant.

I never want the questioned scenario to accidentally happen to me, so I
conceal my identity when I browse. You should too.
