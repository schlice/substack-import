**Who gets to pay for the 5 dead + 2 suicides at the Capital? No one
talks anymore about them.**

The criminals who committed criminal acts are the ones who will pay. If
they were killed by trampling or some other accident, then no one but
society pays.

**Could "civilian" Trump still be indicted by a Grand Jury involving
culpability if the DA in DC can bring charges? RE: Inciting a riot
resulting in death?**

Sure, if you can find enough evidence that her did that, but currently
there is not. He gave a very public speech, for which we have the entire
transcript, and it does not amount to inciting a riot.

We apply the legal test to determine when highly emotionally charged
speech can be restricted in order to determine that. It\'s called the
Brandenburg test, from the Supreme Court case where it was invented:
*Brandenburg v. Ohio.* The Brandenburg test says that speech can be
restricted if:

1.  the speech is "directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless
    action," AND
2.  the speech is "likely to incite or produce such action."

BOTH elements are required. But what is "imminent?" The imminence test
was exemplified in another case which used the Brandenburg test: Hess v.
Indiana in 1973. The court concluded that Hess' speech, while laced with
vulgarities, did not specify a time for lawless action. The Court
concluded that the speech "amounted to nothing more than advocacy of
illegal action at some indefinite future time."

But it's not just imminence. In order to qualify as inciting, it must
direct listeners to imminent *lawless* action. Trump did not even
suggest to his listeners that they engage in lawless action, even if it
was imminent. ***Even if he knew*** that lawless action would ensue from
his speech, it doesn't make his speech inciting because *he didn't
actually suggest committing lawless action.*

And just because his speech riled up an already incitable crowd doesn't
make it unconstitutional, either. In another Brandenburg test case,
*NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware* in 1982, the Court discussed why fiery
rhetoric is not unlawful:

> *Strong and effective extemporaneous rhetoric cannot be nicely
> channeled in purely dulcet phrases. An advocate must be free to
> stimulate his audience with spontaneous and emotional appeals for
> unity and action in a common cause. When such appeals do not incite
> lawless action, they must be regarded as protected speech.*

When that test is applied, you find that the speech did not meet the
legal standard for speech which can be restricted, so the speech was
Constitutional. Unwise, maybe. But Constitutional? Definitely.
