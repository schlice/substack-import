I'll echo what [[Paul
Harding](https://www.quora.com/profile/Paul-Harding-14)]{.qlink_container}
said, but add a little bit of the law behind it so you understand why
this is.

- There are **no** provisions in the law which allow you to disobey the
  lawful orders of a peace officer in the course of his duty.
- Whether or not the police officer was acting lawfully or whether or
  not the police officer was correctly enforcing the law are matters of
  **fact** to be determined by a judge or a jury. No one on the street
  has the authority to determine whether or not a police officer is
  acting lawfully.

Knowing these two facts (you never have the right to disobey a peace
officer who is acting lawfully, and whether or not the officer is acting
lawfully is up to a judge to decide), on the street, ***you must presume
the officer is acting lawfully and you must obey the police officer's
lawful orders. How do you know the orders are lawful? They come from a
lawfully-appointed police officer doing his job.***

Now some of you are going to cite the times that people disobeyed the
police, were arrested, and were later found to have been innocent. You
can certainly go this route, but as the OP asked, ***you can be arrested
for failing to follow a lawful directive***. You may be found to be
completely innocent, but the onus now falls on you to prove that the
officer was not acting lawfully, and you are doing so from a
respondent's position instead of from a complainant's position.

Remember, the directive is not lawful because the officer is correctly
interpreting the law, **the directive is lawful because it was given by
a lawfully-appointed police officer**. The officer can even be legally
wrong, and you still have to follow the order or face charges for
failing to follow a lawful directive.

Now, on to the service dog. The ADA allows law enforcement and providers
of public accommodation to ask two questions of any owner of a service
animal in a public place:

1.  Is this a service animal trained to assist with a disability as
    recognized by the ADA?
2.  What specifically is this service animal trained to do?

Service animals in-training are usually given the same deference as
actual fully-trained service animals, but they do not need to be. The
general standard is that if a service animal is going to be in a place
where people are, it must act with the same decorum as you would expect
of a person. Therefore, it cannot be a nuisance, it cannot publicly
urinate or defecate in that space, it cannot bother or annoy other
patrons, and it cannot bark incessantly. Service dogs do not do any of
these things unless it is part of their training and they are responding
to an emergency situation. For example, I know of a diabetic service dog
which alerts if its owner is going into a diabetic attack, and will bark
without stopping if its owner loses consciousness until its owner sits
up again. I know of one incident in which this happened, and the dog
responded exactly as it was trained to do, and it saved the woman's
life.
