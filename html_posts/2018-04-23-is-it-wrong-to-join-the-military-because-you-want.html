It's not wrong to want your life to have meaning. It's also not wrong to
want your death to be meaningful as well. It means that you have
purpose, and even in death, your purpose will be served. For anyone who
signs on the dotted line and says that they're willing to give their
life for their country, having a clear sense of purpose is critical. It
allows you to do your duty without hesitation.

Just make sure you have those priorities in the right order. Do your
utmost to come home safely. But know that your sacrifice will be honored
if you don't make it.
