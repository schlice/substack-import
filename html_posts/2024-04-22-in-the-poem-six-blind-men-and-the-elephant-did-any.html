No, none of the answers were correct.

They all gave the answer they thought was correct based on their limited
interpretation of what they could sense on their own.

But *we* know the correct answer, because we have the view of the
***narrator*** (the one telling the story). We can see that the blind
men, in describing the elephant, do not correctly identify that it is an
elephant they are touching.
