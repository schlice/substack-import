**Why do you go to jail if you help your wife to commit suicide?**

Because in the United States, it is illegal to assist someone to commit
suicide.

In the states where physician assisted suicide is legal, there is a
specific process you have to go through to make it legal. It involves
multiple doctors, waiting periods, etc.
