**How can you protect your phone from being hacked?**

It's extremely unlikely that your physical device would be hacked
remotely. So long as you are using a modern device and you haven't
rooted/jailbroken your device, the security from the manufacturer is
usually sufficient to prevent the device from being attacked remotely.

Specifically for Android, don't install applications from the Internet
if you are unsure about their origin.

You are far more vulnerable on your connections than you are on your
phone, especially if you connect via Wi-Fi. If you go to Starbuck's and
you allow your phone to connect to their free Wi-Fi, your connections
can be monitored, pretty easily.

If you frequently connect to open Wi-Fi, you should invest in a Virtual
Private Network (VPN). This secures your connection from start to
finish.
