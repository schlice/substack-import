Not just "biblical literalists." Scientists believe in the existence of
Adam and Eve, too. They simply refuse to admit the correlation between
our DNA ancestors and the Adam and Eve from the Bible. We know from
investigation that "Y-chromosomal Adam" and "Mitochondrial Eve" existed.
We even know they existed about the same time. Skeptics though do not
believe that the two even knew each other. Nevertheless, we know that
they both existed.

If you believe that the Bible is indeed the inspired word of God, there
is no reason to think that anything written in it is simply "didactic
fiction."
