**Content:** [At 22, you are a legal adult in the UK.\
\
Your dad is under no obligation to permit you to continue to live at his
house once you have reached the age of majority, which is 18 in the UK.\
\
It\'s time to either move out, or sign a lease agreement with your dad
whereby you pay him rent to continue to live there. At that point, you
have some legal rights, but without a lease agreement, you have none.
You live there at the pleasure of the homeowner, who can evict you at
any time.]{.rendered_qtext}
