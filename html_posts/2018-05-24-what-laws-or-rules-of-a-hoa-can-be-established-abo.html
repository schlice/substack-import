**What laws or rules of a HOA can be established about homeowners with
out of control kids?**

The answer really depends on what "out-of-control kids" do to harm other
neighbors.

If there is vandalism or noise after 11:00 PM, it is out of the HOA's
hands. Contact your local police department.

HOAs usually do have rules about excessive noise, nuisance odors, and
disturbing other neighbors unnecessarily. You should have a look at the
Governing Documents to see if any HOA rules that currently exist might
cover your situation.

If not, talk to the HOA Board members. They are homeowners too, and they
live in your neighborhood with you. I'm sure they can find a way to
assist you.
