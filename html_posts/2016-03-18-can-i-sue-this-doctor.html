If a doctor prescribed a medication which was not specifically approved
to treat that disease and/or condition, insurance may deny the claim for
the drug, since it isn\'t proven to treat the condition listed.

That doesn\'t mean that it can\'t treat that condition. Obviously, we
know it can. We know that it has secondary uses, and may even benefit
your grandmother. We know it will help her sleep and treat some memory
issues. Therefore, even though it\'s a schizophrenia drug, it can help
your grandmother in her case.

I was looking for something non-habit forming to help me sleep. My RxN
prescribed me Gabapentin. Gabapentin\'s official \"on-label\" use is as
an anti-seizure medicine. The problem with it is that it is very
short-acting. It only works for about four hours. So as an anti-seizure
medicine, while it does work, it\'s not often prescribed for seizures.
There are much better anti-seizure drugs out there (i.e. more
long-acting) However, the drug also induces drowsiness (it\'s a known
side-effect of the drug). So she prescribed it to me. It works quickly
(within an hour) and only lasts for a few hours in your system. This was
ideal for me, and it worked very well as a sleep aid.
