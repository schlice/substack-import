**Content:** [Sure. Law enforcement does this by increasing the amount
of paperwork it takes to arrest someone.\
\
Therefore, there is a threshold at which officers won\'t arrest someone
because they\'re not worth the paperwork.\
\
In all seriousness, if someone broke the law, how exactly is their
arrest \"unnecessary?\" And how exactly can you arrest someone if they
don\'t break the law? I suppose the officer could fabricate a charge,
but you can\'t really prevent that, just like you can\'t prevent
citizens from breaking the law. You can only bring them to justice once
they do.]{.rendered_qtext}
