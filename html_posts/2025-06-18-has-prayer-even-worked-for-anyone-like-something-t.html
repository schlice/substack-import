It's impossible to know the answer to that question. We'll never know if
the "response to prayer" was *because* of the prayer, or was going to
happen that way anyway. Even if it was a one in a million thing, there
is no definitive proof that it would have happened one way *but for* the
intervention of God.

Only God knows.

People get hung up on that all the time. Like, "If God knew how it was
going to turn out, then my prayer didn't mean anything, because it was
going to happen the way God saw it happen."

It's true that God exists outside of time and space. For God, everything
is *now*. The past is *now*. The present is *now.* The future is *now*.
So God sees it all, as He is not constrained by time.

Therefore, if we apply that thought to your prayer, then you could say
that God saw, for all time, that something was going to happen, He also
saw, for all time, that you were going to pray for that person. And so
He could, for all time, choose to honor your prayer by making the
outcome happen in the way you prayed. So even though it didn't happen in
human "real time," God did "hear" the prayer, and He did "act" on it.
And it still happened because you chose to pray.

Nevertheless, we'll never be able to know if God intervened until we get
the chance to talk to Him face to face.
