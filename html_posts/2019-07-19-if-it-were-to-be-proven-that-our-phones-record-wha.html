**If it were to be proven that our phones record what we say, would this
be a HIPAA violation?**

In and of itself, your phone simply recording what you say is not
necessarily a HIPAA violation.

What happens to that recording may create a HIPAA violation.

However, there is a far more overarching and applicable set of rules
than HIPAA: **wiretapping law**.

This is the set of law which encompasses recording of telephone
conversations. If your conversations are being recorded without your
permission, or not in accordance with state law, the recorder can be
charged with illegal wiretapping. It's also a federal crime to record
someone without their knowledge. It's also a federal crime to use or
disclose any information obtained by illegal recording of a telephone.

A HIPAA violation may be in there somewhere as well.
