This is a great question, and very prescient, I might add.

Because of the proliferation of "fake news," and the attention it has
brought, some have questioned whether or not such a thing should be
legal.

So the question is: **Does the First Amendment protect fake news?**

The short answer is yes. We know that it does, but the real question
should be under what circumstances would fake news *not* be protected?
There are already some classes of speech which can run you into legal
trouble, and clearly the biggest one is libel. Defamation is closely
related. But knowingly publishing something you know not to be true is
not a crime, regardless of how untrue it really is.

But what if it's so compelling, and social media picks up on it, that it
spreads like wildfire and people start to believe it?

So what then do we do? How do you counter free speech? Do you do so by
*restricting* that speech?

To that, I can say most definitely **no**.

**You counter incorrect but free speech with more, correct, free
speech.**

You win hearts and minds in the arena of ideas. You have to learn to
present better, more cogent arguments, and counter ideology with fact.
Don't try to *silence* your opponent. Instead, *debunk* your opponent.

There are some other ways around fake news distribution, and that is
with better editorial oversight. Facebook is building and refining tools
to do this automatically. Google is "demonetizing" content that does not
meet its "quality standards." Editorial discretion is actually also
protected free speech, so this fits quite nicely with the tenet of using
free speech to counter fake news.

**TL;DR: Criminalizing fake news is not the way to go. Countering fake
free speech with louder, correct free speech is the correct way to go.**
