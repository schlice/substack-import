The real answer is \"it depends.\"

There are many definitions of the beginning and the end of a river.
Sometimes, to find the source of a river requires defining the end of
the river. Some definitions of the end of a river:

- greatest distance away
- greatest drop in altitude
- a lake with many inflows but only one major outflow

And probably the oddest definition

- the place where people stop using the river\'s name

The Top Gear crew took a rather dubious postulation, following the
\"lake with one outflow\" definition, and stated that the mouth of the
Nile was not actually in Alexandria, but at the other end of the
Mediterranean, at the Straits of Gibraltar. This allowed them to define
other sources farther west which feed the Med, leading them to find a
source southwest of Lake Victoria.

Also, keep in mind that there is no one source of a river. There are
many bodies of water that feed a river. A combination of definitions can
lead you to find a source of a river, or selectively including/excluding
certain definitions can lead you to another source.

So if you use a more loose definition of what a river is (assuming that
the Mediterranean is actually part of the river), then the Top Gear crew
may have found a source.
