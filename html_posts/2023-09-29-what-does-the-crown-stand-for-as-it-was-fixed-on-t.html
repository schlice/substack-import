Here's an interesting truth about the Bible: *not everything in the
Bible is an allegory*. Sometimes, the words in the Bible mean exactly
what they say they mean.

What *is* symbolic is the **thorn**. Thorns are used throughout the
Bible as a symbol of evil.

> But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before
> you, then it shall be that those whom you let remain shall be
> irritants in your eyes and thorns in your sides, and they shall harass
> you in the land where you dwell (Numbers 33:55).

Jesus said:

> By their fruit you will recognize them. Do people pick grapes from
> thornbushes, or figs from thistles? (Matthew 7:16).

The Apostle Paul had a thorn in the flesh that he asked God to remove (2
Corinthians 12:7).

And of course, the Roman soldiers made a crown of thorns for Jesus to
wear.

But is the crown of thorns symbolic of anything else? Beyond the
symbolism of the thorn, **no,** it's really not. The Roman soldiers were
mocking "Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews" (the sign they hung above
Him on the cross. In fact, if you've ever looked at Catholic crucifixes,
you'll usually see a little sign above Jesus that says "INRI." It stands
for *Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudaeorum* in Latin. Pilate ordered the sign
posted above Jesus on the cross).

So accordingly, while the soldiers were mocking Him, they placed a robe
around His shoulders, they placed a "sceptre" of a reed in His hand, and
they "jammed" a crown of thorns onto His head. Then they mockingly said,
"All hail Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews!" You can hear them
derisively laughing amongst themselves while they did this.

You should be able to tell then how the thorns might relate to evil, and
how a crown of thorns, while clearly designed to *hurt*, were also
symbolic of evil. The entire display was evil, and the crown of thorns
just topped off an entire display of humanity's fall.

One of the great principles of hermeneutics is to take Scripture in its
most natural, normal, customary sense. While trying to discern its
meaning, we try to figure out the intended meaning of the passage to the
target audience. And in that, *if the* ***plain*** *sense* ***makes***
*sense, you've got the* ***right*** *sense.*
