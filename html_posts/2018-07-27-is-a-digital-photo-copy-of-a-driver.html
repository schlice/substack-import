**Is a digital photo copy of a driver\'s license acceptable as ID for
someone at a concert or festival who is not drinking or driving?**

A very small handful of states are testing out electronic driver's
licenses. The process is lengthy and requires that not only the state
provide a valid electronic license, but that the people within the state
required to accept them have the requisite technology to do so. It's a
very slow process and it's only in its pilot stages in a few states.

Which means that as far as identification goes, electronic licenses (and
I'm talking about approved electronic licenses, not a picture of a
license) still have a long way to go before they would be accepted as a
valid form of ID.

In general, a picture of a license is not a valid form of ID. To be
fair, it's really up to the venue to decide if they'd accept a picture
of a license as a valid form of ID, but because PhotoShop, there's
virtually no way that any venue in its right mind would accept a picture
of a license as a valid form of ID.
