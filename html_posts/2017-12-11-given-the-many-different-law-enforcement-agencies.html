**Given the many different law enforcement agencies in the US, does LEO
get training on how to recognize all the different badges/IDs?**

No. If a law enforcement officer questions an ID card presented to him,
he contacts his dispatcher and has them contact the agency in question
and verify that the person is a law enforcement officer in good
standing.

This is the only method by which a law enforcement officer can be
successfully verified. With over 18,000 law enforcement agencies in the
United States, there is no way that anyone could be well-versed in every
badge and ID card. Locally, you may know the agencies nearby, but you
probably wouldn't be able to easily recognize any from outside your
local area, let alone outside your state.
