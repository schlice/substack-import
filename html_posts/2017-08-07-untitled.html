Ah, I get what you're saying now. Sorry it took me so long to get it. I
have a headache; I guess I'm not thinking as quickly right now.

Your numbers are close to accurate, ***IF*** you consider that all of
those people you excluded are not actually out in society at large. So
if all the people below age 21 and over age 85 stayed home, then yes,
that means that the saturation of people who can legally carry would go
up because fewer people who objectively would not carry are not present
with you at the supermarket or the mall or wherever you may be.

But they are there.

That doesn't change your line of reasoning. That simply means that there
are an objectively larger or smaller percentage of people who *may* be
carrying around you at any one time. For example, if you're in a mall,
there would likely be a larger percentage of people under age 21, so the
likelihood of encountering a legal concealed carrier is lower. But if
you are at a hardware store, you're in the exact target demographic:
majority males between age 21 and 85.

So I get what you're saying, but your numbers only make sense if you
*exclude* those who are unlikely to be carrying from participation in
society. But since they still do actively participate, their numbers
still figure in to the X people in 100 who might be carrying.
