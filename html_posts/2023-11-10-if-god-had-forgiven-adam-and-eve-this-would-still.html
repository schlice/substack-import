If God had wanted Adam and Eve to never have the choice to sin, He never
would have put the trees in the Garden from which they could not eat.

Therefore, if you're following along logically, *the trees must have
been there for a reason.*

That reason was so that Adam and Eve had the free choice to sin or not.

Turns out, they chose to sin.

But "all-loving" doesn't mean that God doesn't punish sin. God punishes
sin *because He loves us.*

Don't parents punish their children when they misbehave? Do they do this
because they hate their children? Hardly. It's because they love their
children and they want them to be better.

The problem with Adam and Eve was that once they disobeyed God, they
were now *sinners*. Sin had entered the human condition, and God cannot
abide sin. God is perfect, and His standard is perfection. Nothing less
is acceptable to Him.

Therefore, Adam and Eve had to leave the Garden and live with their new
sin nature.

God does this because He loves perfectly and He hates perfectly. He
loves completely, but He hates sin completely.

God could not "forgive" Adam and Eve, because to do so would mean to
***ignore their sin.*** A loving, holy, and just God cannot ignore sin.
If He ignored sin, He would not be just. There must be payment for sin.
God demonstrated this time and time again, and He demonstrated that
**blood atonement** is how He covers sin.

It was first demonstrated by God in Genesis 3:

> The Lord God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed
> them. (v. 21 NIV)

Think about that. *God shed innocent blood to cover the sins of Adam and
Eve.* He literally demonstrated blood atonement.

And in a not-at-all-surprising turn of events, *Jesus Christ shed His
innocent blood to cover the sins of the world: past, present, and
future.* ***Jesus died once, for all.***

See the connection there? Cool stuff once you start looking at it.
