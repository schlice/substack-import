**Should the FBI take 3 days to investigate Prof. Fords allegations
against Judge Kavanaugh, prior to his confirmation?**

Thanks for the A2A. No, the FBI should not take any time to investigate
Dr. Ford's allegations, ***because there is no allegation of a Federal
crime, and all background investigations have been successfully
completed***.

The "three days" you cite is related to Clarence Thomas' confirmation
hearings, and the review of Anita Hill's claims of sexual assault. The
reason why the FBI investigated then was that Thomas was a government
employee at the time, on government property, when he allegedly sexually
assaulted Ms. Hill. Therefore, a Federal crime was alleged. The FBI took
three days to determine that Ms. Hill's claims were "unfounded."

In this case, there is no Federal crime alleged, and the FBI has no
authority to investigate state crimes. Additionally, the statute of
limitations has expired, so there is no crime to investigate anyway.

If you're talking about the FBI and its background investigations which
it has already completed on Judge Kavanaugh, those are at the behest of
the White House, and the two they did are already closed. If the White
House is interested, it could direct the FBI to re-open the background
investigation that it just finished and it could ask them to review the
new information, but as of today, the White House does not seem all too
eager to re-open that investigation, and the FBI cannot unilaterally
decide to investigate someone without being directed to do so. Since the
FBI, in the case of the background checks, is under the direction of the
White House, the Senate Judiciary Committee also has no authority to
direct the FBI to re-open that investigation, either.
