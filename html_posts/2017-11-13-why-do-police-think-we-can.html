*Some* government buildings cannot be photographed. Those buildings will
be clearly marked, and police will indeed tell you that you can't
photograph those buildings. Generally, you also can't access those
buildings (i.e. they will be fenced off), but this is not always the
case.

If an officer tells you that you can't photograph a building that you
believe you are allowed to photograph, please feel free to file a
complaint with that officer's department, or head to your nearest ACLU
office to file a First Amendment violation lawsuit. If you don't stand
up to officers who act inappropriately, the behavior will never be
corrected, and you have no reason to complain when it continues.
