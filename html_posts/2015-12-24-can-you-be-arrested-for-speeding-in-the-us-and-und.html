As with all answers that involve the differences between individual
states, the true answer is \"it depends.\"

At a certain point (which is different among states), a moving violation
can be judged by a law enforcement officer to be \"careless\" or
\"reckless.\" For example, in Colorado, \"careless driving\" means
operating a motor vehicle \"in a careless and imprudent manner, without
due regard for the width, grade, curves, corners, traffic, and use of
the streets and highways and all other attendant circumstances.\" This
is a Class 2 misdemeanor, unless the carelessness causes bodily injury,
in which case it is a Class 1 misdemeanor. \"Reckless driving\" means
operating a motor vehicle \"in such a manner as to indicate either a
wanton or a willful disregard for the safety of persons or property.\"
While reckless driving in Colorado is an automatic Class 1 misdemeanor,
subsequent convictions of reckless driving automatically include a
mandatory fine anywhere from \$50 to \$1000, imprisonment from 10 days
to 6 months, or both.

Note that you don\'t necessarily have to be speeding in order to be
convicted of \"careless driving\" or \"reckless driving,\" but at some
point, excessive speed is simply careless. Aggravating circumstances
surrounding speed may lead an officer to believe that the operation of
the motor vehicle was \"careless\" or \"reckless.\"

In some states, at a certain amount over the posted speed, this
transition is automatic. For example, at 40 miles an hour or more over
the posted speed, you no longer get a speeding ticket, but automatically
(by statute) get a reckless driving charge. Off the top of my head, I
can\'t remember what states have statutory reckless driving statutes.
