**Could Obama potentially have been impeached for giving Iran \$50
billion without congressional approval?**

If we were asking about this when Obama did it, the answer would clearly
be no, because it doesn't fit with any of the four actual reasons for
which you can impeach a president.

However, the bar has been lowered now. Presidents can now be impeached
for what the framers referred to as *maladministration*. They were very
worried that impeachment would devolve into partisan posturing, and that
impeachment would turn only on which party has control of the House.

This is the situation we find ourselves in today.

Remember when Senate Presidential appointment confirmations were changed
from a 2/3 majority to a simple majority? We called it the "nuclear
option." Democrats used it successfully, but then Republicans got the
opportunity to use it when they took power, and Democrats were
incredulous. But when they made the change, we warned them of that
eventuality.

Democrats are being similarly short-sighted. When Republicans take
control of the House, you can expect that "abuse of power" will also
encompass maladministration when a Democrat is in the White House.

Additionally, impeachments were never designed to be partisan. If you
have party-line votes, you do not have consensus that you even have an
impeachable offense, and it should not be moving forward. Impeachment is
not a grand jury. Impeachment has to be a complete, bipartisan
investigation and consensus that there is an actual impeachable offense
which occurred. This is the other change that House Democrats have made
to the impeachment process.

So, the new rules:

- Abuse of power now includes simple maladministration.
- Impeachment no longer needs to be a bipartisan, complete
  investigation. The equivalent of a grand jury indictment is all that
  is needed to impeach a President.

So this is not a stupid question. Democrats who dismiss this question as
partisanship are being as shortsighted as the House currently is. This
is a very pertinent question, and it bodes poorly for the future of the
nation.

**TL;DR: Under today's new rules for impeachment, Obama could have been
impeached for giving the \$50 billion to Iran without Congressional
approval. It would rightly have been called "abuse of power" and Obama
would have been impeached on a party-line vote.**
