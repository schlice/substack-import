Armored trucks typically have bullet-resistant windows, cabs, and rear
boxes, run-flat tires and self-sealing fuel tanks, designed to withstand
bullet fire from most small arms (handguns and rifles). The boxes are
also insulated, so they can withstand heat from fires. Basically, the
goal of these trucks is to protect the contents inside as well as
prevent it from being stolen or hijacked.
