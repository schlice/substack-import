Thank you. In thinking about it, I really hung on to her too long. When
she got the tumor on her brain stem, I probably should have put her down
at that point. She had periods of lucidity where I could see her
personality come through, but she was never really the same after that.
I held on to her more for myself than for her, and as much as I beat
myself up for keeping her alive during that time, I have to not do that
because it was my first experience with such a thing.

And while I will never forget her, and I will always miss her (next to
my wife, she was my best friend), our new friend just turned one, and
she has her own unique personality, and she is finding her place in our
home. It's cool watching her carve out her little niche in our family.
