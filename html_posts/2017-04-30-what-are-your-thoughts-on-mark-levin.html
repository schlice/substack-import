I mostly like them. They are pretty common sense and would go a long way
to fixing government bloat and dysfunction that took us away from our
original purpose.

I'd change a few and add a few though.

In case you're wondering, here's the full list:

> 1.  Impose Congressional term limits
> 2.  Repeal the Seventeenth Amendment, returning the election of
>     Senators to state legislatures
> 3.  Impose term limits for Supreme Court Justices and restrict
>     judicial review
> 4.  Require a balanced budget and limit federal spending and taxation
> 5.  Define a deadline to file taxes (one day before the next federal
>     election)
> 6.  Subject federal departments and bureaucratic regulations to
>     periodic reauthorization and review
> 7.  Create a more specific definition of the Commerce Clause
> 8.  Limit eminent domain powers
> 9.  Allow states to more easily amend the Constitution by bypassing
>     Congress
> 10. Create a process where two-thirds of the states can nullify
>     federal laws
> 11. Require photo ID to vote and limit early voting

Here's what I would change:

I would replace #5. My #5 would say: **Repeal the 16th Amendment and
replace it with the**
[[**FairTax**](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=58cd5b&url=http://www.fairtax.org){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="fairtax.org"}]{.qlink_container}. Consumption is a far more
stable income source than income for the government. I won't go through
the whole thing here, but I like a national sales tax better than an
income tax.

I would also amend #6 and make it read: Subject federal departments and
bureaucratic regulations to periodic reauthorization and review **and
make all regulations passed by such agencies directly attributable to
the Congressional departments that authorized the federal agency.**
Federal bureaucrats have no accountability, and the regulations passed
by their departments have the full force of law. This is a
**bureaucracy**. And Congress let it happen. That needs to be addressed.

I don't like #9. I think the bar would have to be higher to bypass
Congress, like 4/5th of the states (40 out of 50). I know it's already a
high bar to get a Constitutional amendment passed, but I still feel like
you're approaching mob rule if you allow 3/5ths of the states to bypass
Congress. If you've already implemented #2 and #3, then the Senate and
the Supreme Court are already back to their original concepts, so
getting an amendment to pass Congress should be easier.

Otherwise, it's a great step in the right direction.
