**Content:** [There are certain conditions in which the municipality in
question is trying to change its enforcement policy.\
\
As you know, a law is only as good as its enforcement. In my area,
\"sliding\" is a traffic violation (i.e. making a left turn into the
right lane). However, it has never been enforced other than to add it as
an additional infraction during an accident investigation. A few years
ago, the city started a public awareness campaign to improve compliance
with this law. Our city and county officers and deputies were directed
to make traffic stops for the infraction, but to only issue warnings for
the behavior. This was an attempt to advise people that their driving
behaviors were in fact illegal before actual enforcement
began.]{.rendered_qtext}
