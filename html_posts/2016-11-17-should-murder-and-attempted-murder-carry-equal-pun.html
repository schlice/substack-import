I must say I love [[Loretta B.
DeLoggio](https://www.quora.com/profile/Loretta-B-DeLoggio)]{.qlink_container}'s
answer, but I fall squarely into the camp that has an opinion on this
issue.

Let's first look at what is required to be charged with an attempt.
There must be clear evidence that you were planning, plotting, scheming,
or preparing to commit a crime (in other words, the legal definition of
intent to actually commit a crime is met), and in addition, you took
**direct action** towards the completion of that crime.

In the moral sense, the attempt and the actual crime are exactly the
same. Morality refers to the state of morals which would lead someone to
commit crimes. It is equally as morally reprehensible to attempt to
commit a crime as if to actually commit the crime itself.

However, we do not legislate morality, nor can we.

Legally, therefore, there is a difference between the attempt and the
commission of a crime. Because the attempt falls short of actually
committing a crime, you cannot be charged with committing a crime when
you did not. This is why, in a society where we live by a standard of
laws and not a standard of morals, we have a separate offense for
attempting to commit a crime. You were *most of the way* there to
committing a crime, but you did not.

Therefore, because the commission of the crime did not take place, the
criminal is not "actually" a criminal. The criminal was an "almost"
criminal. The difference between "almost" and "actually" under the law
is significant enough to charge the attempted felon less severely than
the actual felon.
