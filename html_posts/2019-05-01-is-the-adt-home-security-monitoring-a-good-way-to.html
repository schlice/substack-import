**Is the ADT home security monitoring a good way to protect your
house?**

ADT home security works admirably. The ADT Pulse system is a very tidy
integrated system which includes all of the traditional alarm system
components (door/window contacts, smoke detectors, CO detectors, etc),
cameras, touch pad controllers, a mobile app, and the ability to
incorporate Z-Wave devices as well, such as thermostats, light
controllers, smart plugs, door locks, garage door controllers, and any
other compatible Z-Wave device.

Is it a good *value* for what you get? As with any of the big providers,
I think it is somewhat overpriced compared with what you get. You can
find better value elsewhere.

But if you already have a wired home security system installed in your
house, switching it over to ADT is a fine way to protect your home.
