**Will the Space Force/Command have a service academy?**

As I understand it, the Space Force will be a component command
underneath the Department of the Air Force (just as the Marine Corps is
organized as a part of the Department of the Navy).

Therefore, just like Marine Corps officers have their standard
commissioning source through Annapolis, Space Force officers will
similarly be trained at the Air Force Academy and will be commissioned
into the Space Force directly from there.
