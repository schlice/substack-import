The right simply can't explain away a catch-phrase that has been bandied
about and is now part of the discussion. The simple fact that *it does
not exist* isn't enough to explain it away. You have to explain where it
came from and why it is fallacious in order to "explain" it.

The media-coined term "gun-show loophole" actually originated from the
fact that, in most states, private sales between individuals do not
require background checks. The media simply didn't make it clear that
***inside*** the gun show, background checks **do** take place, but at a
gun show, you also have a marketplace of buyers (and potentially,
sellers) all in the same place. There is nothing stopping me (a shopper,
not a dealer) from, say, watching someone else shopping for a gun and
then telling that person that I have a gun out in my car that I'd sell
him for less than this one here on the table, and we go out to the car
and do a private sale, no background check required. That's the
"loophole."

The problem: **it's not a "loophole."** A "loophole" in a law is when a
specific set of circumstances can be invoked which would controvert the
actual will of the law. For example, if a law said that all firearms
purchases by anyone required a background check, yet you found a way to
make a legal purchase without one, that would be a "loophole" in the
law.

There is no "loophole" in this law because private party sales were
**specifically excluded** from the background check requirement. When
the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) was
started, it was specifically restricted to firearms dealers. There is no
general public access to it. As such, it was determined to be
prohibitive to force all sellers and buyers to do background checks for
every private party transfer or sale, and lawmakers specifically ensured
that private party sales would not be subject to the background check
provisions. States like Colorado saw fit to pass laws that went ahead
and mandated that all private party transfers or sales required
background checks conducted by a FFL dealer anyway. These laws are
mostly ignored and many of them are simply not enforced. Studies have
shown that they wouldn't have prevented any crimes had they been
enforced as written anyway. So are "universal background checks" an
answer to crime, and somehow the "gun show loophole" is preventing us
from stopping crime? No, and no.

**TL;DR:** Both parts of the "gun show loophole" trope are incorrect:
the sales don't actually occur in the gun show, and it's not a loophole.
