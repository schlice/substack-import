<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [Some local municipalities, instead of incorporating (so<br>that they can create their own police force), will hire local security<br>contractors who respond to residential alarm calls and \"calls for<br>service\" which don\'t necessarily fall in the realm of a sworn officer.<br>Our dispatchers can direct non-emergency calls to those agencies when<br>the situation demands. It\'s good to have them there to deflect those<br>types of calls for service. The service is still needed; the<br>municipality has spent the money on the PSC, so we use them.\<br>\<br>Like I said, as long as they know their job, we get along just<br>fine.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-do-police-officers-think-of-private-security-guards/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
