<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [Some local municipalities, instead of incorporating (so
that they can create their own police force), will hire local security
contractors who respond to residential alarm calls and \"calls for
service\" which don\'t necessarily fall in the realm of a sworn officer.
Our dispatchers can direct non-emergency calls to those agencies when
the situation demands. It\'s good to have them there to deflect those
types of calls for service. The service is still needed; the
municipality has spent the money on the PSC, so we use them.\
\
Like I said, as long as they know their job, we get along just
fine.]{.rendered_qtext}
