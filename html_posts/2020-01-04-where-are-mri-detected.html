**Where are MRI-detected \"lesions\" located in the brain? Are they on
nodes of the brain that actually control certain neurological functions,
like sight, sound, memory, etc.**

In Multiple Sclerosis, the immune system attacks myelinated axons in the
central nervous system, destroying the myelin and the axon in variable
degrees. Areas of white matter in the brain are affected, including
those of the cerebral hemispheres, infratentorium, and spinal cord. MS
lesions, known as plaques, may form in CNS white matter **in any
location**, which makes diagnosis difficult.[\[1\]](#eEKda){#cite-eEKda

Additionally, location of lesions does not necessarily correlate
directly with clinical presentation, which makes MRI reading that much
more challenging.
