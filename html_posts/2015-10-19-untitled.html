<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [The Air Force eschewed the \"inside the boot\" method in
the late 90s because oftentimes, remains can be dismembered in an
aircraft crash. The boot seemed like a good place at the time, because
boots survived a fire (usually were the only article of clothing to
survive an aircraft fire). But more often that not, a violent crash left
a servicemember without his boots (and the feet that went along with
them), so putting the dog tags in the boots was forbidden.\

Aircrews are still required to wear both dog tags
