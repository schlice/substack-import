I'm not sure I understand the concept of "less guilty." Are we trying to
say that certain sins are worse than others? The Catholics do this, as
they differentiate certain sins as *venial* or *mortal*.

Christians do not do this. To the Christian, all sin is an affront to
God, and all sin must be atoned for. No sin against God causes any less
or more guilt. All of us are sinners, and all of us are guilty in God's
eyes, and all of us are deserving of God's wrath. But God's grace saves
us, through the sanctifying blood of Christ.

(Note that there is one difference, and it has to do with "the
unpardonable sin," but that's a different concept, and not one we are
discussing here)

Is it true that an open sinner is less guilty than he who professes to
