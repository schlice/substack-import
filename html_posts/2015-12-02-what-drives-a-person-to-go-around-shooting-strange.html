**Content:** [Mental instability coupled with a perceived injustice.\
\
This instability usually allows the person to truly believe that they
are doing something good and productive by taking lives.\

Adam Lanza (the Sandy Hook shooter) truly believed that shooting
children would make up for some perceived injustice that they have
suffered. Ultimately, we will never know truly what drove Lanza, but
that combination of mental instability (believing that killing people to
\"even the score\" is justified and is acceptable) along with the fact
that \"a score\" even exists is the most volatile situation you can
