**Are police cars equipped with radars/lidars that allow for accurate
speed calculations while the police car is driving in the opposite
direction of a speeding car?**

Yes.

In-car RADAR units will calculate many different speeds. They will use
speeds of the vehicle passing stationary objects to determine the speed
of the police car itself, and then will use that number to calculate
other speeds. Most in-car units will calculate and continuously display
the speed of the fastest car in the vicinity, the nearest car in the
vicinity, and will also display the speed of oncoming vehicles.
