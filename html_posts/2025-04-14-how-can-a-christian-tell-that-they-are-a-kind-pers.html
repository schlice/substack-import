I think there is a confusion here between ***how*** we should be kind
and ***why*** we should be kind.

As far as ***how*** we should be kind, the Bible actually instructs you
to determine how based on personal gain.

> *"So whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them,
> for this is the Law and the Prophets. \-- Matthew 7:12 ESV*

Jesus says here that you should do what you'd want others to do to you.
This is the Golden Rule (and you may not have known before right now
that it came out of the Bible).

But ***why*** we should be kind is another matter. We should be kind,
not just because we are commanded to be kind, because ***God is kind to
us.***

Clearly, God (through Jesus) commands us to be kind:

> *Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is
> good for building up, as fits the occasion, that it may give grace to
> those who hear. \-- Ephesians 4:29 ESV*

But we should also be kind because He was kind to us first:

> *Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God
> in Christ forgave you. \-- Ephesians 4:32 ESV*

Notice that it's not that the person we're kind to is kind to us. We are
kind to others because God is kind to us, not others. That's exceedingly
important. We have not once in this discussion looked at whether or not
others are actually kind to us. We did examine *how we would want others
to treat us,* but that's different from *how others* ***actually***
*treat us.*

\

Probably most importantly to this discussion, **true kindness doesn't
come from us. True kindness comes from the Spirit.**

> *But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness,
> goodness, faithfulness, \-- Galatians 5:22 ESV*

Kindness in our hearts comes from the Spirit. It is an orientation of
our hearts towards others despite whether they deserve it, despite
whether they love us in return.

> *But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing in
> return, and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the
> Most High, for he is kind to the ungrateful and the evil. \-- Luke
> 6:35 ESV*

And it may not always feel good to be kind. Sometimes, it feels just as
good as getting smacked in the head.

> *Let a righteous man strike me---it is a kindness;\
> let him rebuke me---it is oil for my head;\
> let my head not refuse it.\
> Yet my prayer is continually against their evil deeds. \-- Psalm 141:5
> ESV*

But if you can manage to do it, kindness bears much fruit in your life.

> *Whoever pursues righteousness and kindness\
> will find life, righteousness, and honor. \-- Proverbs 21:21 ESV*
