**Where\'s the best pizza in Colorado Springs?**

You're asking for an opinion. My opinion of what is the best pizza will
most certainly differ from yours.

If you like real New York-style pizza, you can't go wrong with
[[Borriello
Brothers](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=170bbe&url=http://www.borriellobrothers.com/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="borriellobrothers.com"}]{.qlink_container}. But understand
what New York style pizza is. It started out in New York City in the
early 1900s where Italian immigrant *pizzaiolos* (pizza makers) were
forced to use lower-temperature coal-fired pizza ovens where hardwoods
were scarce. Old Italian pizza ovens burned much hotter and made firm
crusts; New York pizza is cooked at a lower temperature, resulting in a
softer crust. It's floppy; it generally has to be folded in half so that
you can get it into your mouth. And if it's cooked with real cheese
(most is), you'll find that the oils from the cheese will drip out into
your hand from the fold. Yep, that's New York style pizza.

If you're more interested in Italian-style pizza (also known as
Neapolitan pizza) and a simpler ingredient set, check out [[Duca's
Neapolitan
Pizza](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=915d22&url=http://ducaspizza.com/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="ducaspizza.com"}]{.qlink_container}. It's cooked in real
wood-burning ovens at around 800--900 degrees, fully cooking a pizza in
about 90 seconds. It's been certified by the **Associazione Vera Pizza
Napoletana** which registers approved suppliers of "Vera Pizza
Napoletana" --- the 'true Neapolitan pizza.' The designation is only
given to pizzerias that met strict requirements that respect the
tradition and the art of Neapolitan pizza making.

If you're looking for the eclectic in pizza-making and perhaps some
tradition in Colorado Springs, you should visit [[Fargo's
Pizza.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=fff650&url=http://www.fargospizza.com/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="fargospizza.com"}]{.qlink_container} It's very much an
experience as well as relatively decent pizza. Notable is the use of
large corn meal on the bottom of their crusts. It's odd, but oddly
satisfying. They have a huge pizza menu as well as a very large salad
bar, an arcade, and Victorian period costuming and theming. It's
definitely something to see.

Also worth mentioning:

- [[Marcos
  Pizza](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e2da3d&url=https://www.marcos.com){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
  qt-tooltip="marcos.com"}]{.qlink_container} - family owned and
  operated here in town, and they make very good pizza
- [[Blackjack
  Pizza](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3772fb&url=https://blackjackpizza.com/){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
  qt-tooltip="blackjackpizza.com"}]{.qlink_container} - a Colorado
  Springs institution

And some of the smaller, up-and-coming, but no less good, chains:

- [[Blaze
  Pizza](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7ec99e&url=http://blazepizza.com/){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
  qt-tooltip="blazepizza.com"}]{.qlink_container}
- [[MOD
  Pizza](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f3bf3a&url=https://modpizza.com/){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
  qt-tooltip="modpizza.com"}]{.qlink_container}

Hope this helps.
