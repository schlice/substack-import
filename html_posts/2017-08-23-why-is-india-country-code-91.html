The +91 is called the **country code**.

As the phone system was expanded outside of the United States, we
realized that we needed to either expand the number of digits for
everyone, or to add a **prefix** to identify the country to which the
call should be routed.

If you are in the United States, the country code is 1. To tell the
switching system you want to make an international call, you first dial
011, then add the country code (i.e. 44 for the UK or 91 for India), and
then add the remainder of the phone number.
