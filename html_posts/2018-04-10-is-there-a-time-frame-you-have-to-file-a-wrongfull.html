**Is there a time frame you have to file a wrongfull death on a ceetain
officer an several other ones an the medics that responded to a 911 call
I made?**

Yes, there is a timeframe you have to file a wrongful death lawsuit, and
if you're looking to do so against a government agency (like the
police), your timeframe is even smaller. It's called the *statute of
limitations*, and as I said, if you're wanting to sue the government,
not only are there very short statutes of limitations, but there are
steps you must follow before you can file, and if you don't, you lose
your standing to file. Just as an example, some cities require that you
file a notice of intent to sue within 30 days of the incident or you
lose your standing.

The laws and the statutes of limitations are different in every city, so
you **must** contact an attorney, and you must do so very quickly, or
you may miss your opportunity to file.

However, remember the elements required for wrongful death in almost
every jurisdiction:

- The death of a human being;
- Caused by another\'s **negligence**, or with **intent** to cause harm;
- The survival of family members who are suffering monetary injury as a
  result of the death, and;
- The appointment of a personal representative for the decedent\'s
  estate.[\[1\]](#SwzJf){#cite-SwzJf .citation_link}

These elements *must* be present in order to have standing to file. The
suit may only be brought by the personal representative for the
decedent's estate, which is why that element is required.

Negligence or intent to cause harm is also a required element.
Accidental injury does not rise to the level of wrongful death.
Negligence means that the person being sued *knew* the correct course of
action, and *willfully* chose to do something else. It is your burden to
prove that this happened with a preponderance of evidence, which means
that more than half of all of the evidence points to negligence or
intent to cause harm.

In any case, as everyone here has already said, you must contact an
attorney.
