I want to say I don't advocate carrying this device. I agree with the
other posters: get a gun. Learn how to use it. It will save your life.
You can always stick a tac light on the rail, or heck, carry a mini
light too.

But since you asked, this is a device which has a light, an alarm, and a
less-than-lethal weapon to stop an intruder.

The biggest problem that exists here is that in order to use this tool,
you have to be close enough to reach out and touch your assailant.
That's at least six feet too close for my taste. That's hand-to-hand
range, and I don't like putting you in that position. Therefore, I do
not recommend this device.

But as I said, you asked, so I delivered.

Now, if you're willing to forego the alarm, I offer you this:

:::: ui_qtext_image_outer
::: qtext_image_wrapper
![](images/qimg-23a27a29ae8b9f71637e26475e79560b){.landscape
.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed

master_h="400"}

The [[TASER
Strikelight](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=fa5e81&url=https://www.axon.com/products/taser-strikelight){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="axon.com"}]{.qlink_container}: a combination flashlight and
stun gun. But this suffers from the same fatal flaw: you have to be
within striking distance to use it.

So therefore, if you change the design just a little, and make the light
portion a little smaller, you get this:

:::: ui_qtext_image_outer
::: qtext_image_wrapper
![](images/qimg-ef8ae163f6ff0e150804959eb944f059){.landscape
.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed

master_h="400"}

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="axon.com"}]{.qlink_container}. Legal for carry in most
states. 15-foot range, well out of reach of an assailant. Has a
flashlight, but still no alarm.

Please strongly consider the Bolt for your personal protection needs.

No, I do not work for Axon, the company which makes the TASER.

(EDIT) Since I'm being asked, in the United States, [[it's legal in most
states](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8f3cbd&url=https://buy.taser.com/taser-state-requirements){.external_link

TASER. TASERs are legal to own in 45 states and Puerto Rico with little
to no restrictions. They are currently banned from civilian ownership in
Washington DC, Hawaii, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New York, and New
Jersey. Know the law for your state before you buy.
