That statement doesn't make much sense. If you have to open your
commentary with "I'm not a racist, but..." that means you're about to
say something racist. That seems pretty cut and dried to me.

You shouldn't have to preface your concerns with any qualifiers at all.
If you pose a legitimate concern with illegal immigration and you are
called a "racist" and "anti-immigration," then the problem is with the
name-caller, not you. Advocating for measures to stop illegal
immigration have nothing at all to do with being "racist" or
"anti-immigration." Tropes about how this nation was founded by
immigrants are tired and woefully overused.

If we are to succeed as a nation of laws, we must, first and foremost,
enforce our immigration laws. There is no other country on Earth with as
lax of an immigration policy and such poor enforcement as our own. And
Trump's "playing to the crowd" with the whole "wall" thing doesn't help
anyone, either. The largest quantity of illegal immigrants comes from
persons overstaying their visas and taking up residence in the country.
We are decades behind the times on our immigration system, and tracking
these people is only getting harder and harder to do. And with no
political will (currently) to actually follow up on these visa
over-stayers, or to put the money into USCBP and ICE that is needed to
update and modernize their operations, little will be done.

The floodgates are currently wide open, but Trump shouldn't be staring
so hard at Mexico; he should be looking at the US government.
