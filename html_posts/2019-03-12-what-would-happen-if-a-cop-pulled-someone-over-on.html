**What would happen if a cop pulled someone over on private property
(personal or business), and the property owner came out and asked the
cop to leave immediately?**

The police do not enforce any private rules on private property; they
only enforce state/city laws at the behest of the business owner.

However, they can follow someone from a public place to private property
(for example, from a city street into a parking lot for a private
business) in order to safely perform their duties. Unfortunately in that
case, the business does not have the right to tell the police to not
conduct police business, regardless of where it happens. The police will
try to not disturb the business as much as possible, but the police can
conduct police business anywhere they need to.

If a business owner told a police officer to leave the property, the
officer would respond that he is conducting police business and he will
leave just as soon as he can, and he will try to not disturb the
business, but he is conducting police business and he can do that
anywhere he has jurisdiction. Any attempt by the business owner to stop
the officer could be met with an arrest for obstruction of justice,
interfering with a police officer, or whatever the charge is in your
jurisdiction.
