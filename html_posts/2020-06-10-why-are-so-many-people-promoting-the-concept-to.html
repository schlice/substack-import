**Why are so many people promoting the concept to \"Defund the Police\"?
To most people that sounds like a horrible idea - is there a better
phrase that could be used to garner more support?**

Sure, there are many. Using a phrase that makes it seem like you want to
completely disband the police doesn't help when you really want to
change them.

Also, actions like Minneapolis are trying to take don't help your cause
either:

[[Minneapolis Will Dismantle Its Police Force, Council Members
Pledge](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=eec646&url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/07/us/minneapolis-police-abolish.html){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="nytimes.com"}]{.qlink_container}

So it *appears* when you say "defund the police" you really mean
"dismantle the police."

Words matter.

So you should use a phrase that means exactly what you want it to mean.
Since what you really want is to severely reduce funding to the police,
but to do that you need to overhaul who they are and what they do, I
might suggest some alternate phrases:

- **Overhaul the Police** - this sends the message that you want to
  strip down and rebuild the police, like when you overhaul a vehicle.

Similarly, you could say

- **Retrofit the Police**
- **Renovate the Police**
- **Modernize the Police**

but I don't think you get the biggest bang for your buck from anything
other than **Overhaul the Police.**
