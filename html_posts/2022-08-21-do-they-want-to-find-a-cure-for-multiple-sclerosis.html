There is this big myth floating around (propped up by books and
testimonies from "doctors" who perpetuate this myth based on rumors or
overheard conversations) that the medical industry could easily find the
cure for lifelong and terminal diseases like cancer, diabetes, and
multiple sclerosis, but if they did, they'd lose their revenue stream
which keeps people sick. Don't believe me? Read the book *Selling
Sickness.*

But that calculus is exceedingly *short-sighted*.

Imagine being the **one researcher**, who works at the **one
pharmaceutical company**, who finds the cause of MS, and manufactures a
simple drug to prevent the cause from ever taking place.

You would be **the person who cured MS.**

**You, and your company, would be instantly world-famous.** You'd be a
*household name.*

For that researcher, there would be endless speaking engagements and
book tours. For that company, you'd be instantly elevated several pegs
above the rest of the drug manufacturers. There's all the rest, but then
there's **you**, the gold standard. Anything you produce from that point
forward would be an instant huge seller. *Brought to you from the
company that cured MS.* What a great tagline for a business. I can't
imagine anything that would bring bigger clout.

Then, you could produce not only the cure, but the simple DNA test which
checked to see if you had the specific genome that could develop into
MS, and you took the preventative drug and never developed MS in the
first place. The possibilities are endless.

In other words, *when one revenue stream dries up because of a cure, ten
more open up.* **And that's good business.**

In all businesses, *we want to work ourselves out of a job*. In my
industry, we want to develop software that doesn't need to be
maintained, that never needs to be fixed. We want to develop hardware
that is so redundant and self-healing that we can replace parts before
they fail, and the end user would never know the difference. In Customer
Service, we want to answer the customer's question before they ever open
up a web ticket or pick up the phone.

In other words, all industries want to make the best possible product,
and to work all of the uncertainty out of it. We come pretty close, but
never so close that we don't need customer service or ongoing
development support.

The notion that we could easily cure diseases, but we don't in order to
keep people sick (and thus on your moneymaking drug) is so far beyond
the pale it is sickening to even entertain the notion.
