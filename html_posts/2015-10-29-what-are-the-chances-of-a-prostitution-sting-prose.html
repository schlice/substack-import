**Content:** [Assuming the situation happened \*exactly\* as you
described, nothing illegal happened.\
\
Prostitution involves an agreement to exchange money for sex. If no
money physically changed hands, and no money was ever discussed,
mentioned, hinted around, or anything else, this wasn\'t prostitution,
it was a hook-up.\
\
Now, if there was any mention of \"how much this was going to cost\" or
\"I do X for \$100\" and then you make an overt act to begin the
transaction (getting undressed will do nicely), it\'s prostitution.\
\
The difference is whether or not money was ever
mentioned.]{.rendered_qtext}
