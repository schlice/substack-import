**My neighbors keep calling the cops and the police have shown up and
dismiss the complaint every time. What actions can I take?**

There are several, but they all begin, like [[Victor
Marquez](https://www.quora.com/profile/Victor-Marquez-20)]{.qlink_container}
said, with documentation.

Keep a record of every one of those calls. Record all the details, as
well as the disposition of those calls.

Once you have that record, you can go in a number of directions. You can
contact the police department and have them investigate whether or not
charges of misuse of the 911 system are in order. Here in Florida,
misuse of 911 is a first-degree misdemeanor punishable by up to a \$1000
fine and up to one year in jail for the first four offenses. A fifth or
subsequent offense are charged as third-degree felonies with penalties
up to \$5000 and up to five years in jail. The police can also charge
the person with creating a nuisance. In Florida, that is a third degree
misdemeanor punishable by a \$500 fine. The person could also be subject
to a state's stalking law, which is defined as willful and repeated
following or harassing. Here, stalking is also a first degree
misdemeanor. Stalking also has an aggravating modifier if there is a
credible threat of harm, and aggravated stalking is a third degree
felony.

Beyond the criminal side, your documentation can be the start of an
order of protection or a restraining order. Violating a restraining
order may be a crime in and of itself, or the violation of a restraining
order may be a modifier to the harassment statute.

There may be valid reasons for someone to contact 911. But in the
absence of such reasons, the calls can turn from mistakes to harassment.
