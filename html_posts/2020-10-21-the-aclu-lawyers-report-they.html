**The ACLU lawyers report they\'re unable to locate parents to 545
children, who are the reminder of the Trump border policy. Could the US
incur sanctions from other countries for this practice?**

Other countries could sanction the United States for whatever reason
they choose, or for no reason at all.

*But why would they?*

The rest of the world wants to trade with us. We get far less benefit
from trading with other countries than they get from trading with us.
Any limitations those countries place on us hurts *them* more than it
hurts *us*.

And in other news that everyone knows but no one acknowledges, people
will *buy* or *steal* children in other countries because they believe
it will get them preferential treatment in the US immigration system.
News flash: it doesn't. So the "parent" gets deported, and you've got a
"Dreamer" left in the country.[\[1\]](#lvcXN){#cite-lvcXN

Other news flash that's not really news: *that's exactly what those
actual parents wanted.* If you believe with all your heart that your
child will have a better life in the United States than they will in
their home country, you'll do anything to get them in, including paying
child mules.

So for many of those 545 children, their biological parents don't care
that there is no parent there for them. They want the foster care system
to take them in, because it will still be a better life for them than
anything they could have had at home. We can't deport them because we
don't know where to send them. Without a parent to claim them, no
country will accept them. And yes, it's true, some of those 545 were
just misplaced. In any system run by humans, human error is bound to
occur. But those children are **all** taken care of. They're not left by
the side of the road or "abandoned" or locked in cages or anything else
that nonsensical Trump haters will tell you. They join the approximately
500,000 children across the nation in our foster care system.
