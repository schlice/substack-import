Even though we are an association of single-family homes (not condos or
townhomes), we have several properties which are Airbnb destinations, or
what are called "luxury rental homes" which are also short-term rentals
(renters stay two weeks or less).

We discourage this practice.

We are against the practice for a number of reasons:

- A community of single-family homes (where residents buy property to
  raise their families; long-term single-resident ownership) is not
  conducive to short-term, in-and-out renters. We have our fair share of
  homes which are leased, but those are long-term rentals (i.e.
  residents in place for 6 months or more).
- If the property is not immaculately maintained and constantly
  monitored, short-term renters leave the place in far worse condition
  than they found it. Even leaving the place slightly worse than it was
  found, over the long term, and with many residents cycled through it,
  leaves a property looking pretty ratty, pretty quickly. Most owners
  don't put the time or effort in to maintaining the property in the way
  in which it should be maintained to keep neighboring home values high.
- Houses used exclusively for short term rentals universally lower
  surrounding home values. No one wants to buy a house next to a motel.
  Even if it's marketed as a "luxury rental" property, it's a motel.
  Average renters stay for two weeks or less.
- It puts tremendous wear on the streets, the driveways, and the house
  itself.
- The renters have ZERO regard for the covenants, and have no interest
  in following any of the neighborhood rules, which leads to many
  dissatisfied neighbors.
- It introduces an insecure element into the neighborhood: in an area
  where neighbors know their neighbors and derive a sense of security
  from understanding what's going on around them, short-term rentals do
  not fit.

The easiest and quickest way for a neighborhood to combat this is to put
in place a covenant amendment which requires the Board to approve every
rental. Along with an application fee, a rental agreement must be
reviewed and approved by the Board before it can be entered into.
Because it is part of the covenants, a home cannot be rented legally
without following this rule. And since the Board can take up to 30 days
to review and approve an application, that essentially puts the kibosh
on Airbnb or short-term rentals.
