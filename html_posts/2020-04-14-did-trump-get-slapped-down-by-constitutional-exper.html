**Did Trump get slapped down by constitutional experts after claiming
his authority is total?**

So you read something on a political website and you want to know if
it's true?

Check what the other guys are saying about it.

Left-leaning website: [[Trump gets slapped down by constitutional
experts after claiming his \'authority is
total\'](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=14480b&url=https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2020/4/14/1937111/-Trump-gets-slapped-down-by-constitutional-experts-after-claiming-his-authority-is-total){.external_link

I'd find an example on a right-leaning website, but the comment is
either glossed over as a Trump gaffe, or it's buried so far under the
deluge of left-leaning "news" sites taking the low softball for a ride.

In this case, yes, nearly ever Constitutional scholar rightly pointed
out that the President does not have "total" authority over the states.
In fact, the Constitution exists specifically to limit the power of the
Federal government. Call it a "slap down" if you like.

Let's all just remember that this isn't the first time we had a
president who thought he could step outside the bounds of the
Constitution. Let's all remember this the next time we have a president
who says that he doesn't care whether or not Congress does its job,
because he has a pen and a phone.

Whether or not you like what the President is claiming he can do should
not matter to the Constitutionality of the action.
