*Where is the justification for the view that \"well regulated\" is just
describing the motivation for the Amendment? Could one not argue that
\"well regulated\
militia\" describes the condition under which one may bear arms? And\
thus a person who is not in a militia may not bear arms?*

Remember that *Heller* explained this (why the prefatory clause is not
limited by the operative clause):

*\"Reading the Second Amendment as protecting only the right to \'keep
and bear Arms\' in an organized militia therefore fits poorly with the
operative clause's description of the holder of that right as \'the
people\'\".*

If it was \"the militia\" that held that right, and not \"the people\"
as a whole, the Amendment would have said, \"the right of the militia to
keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\" But remember that the
framers saw everyone as the militia. Even today, all citizens between 18
and 45 are still part of the unorganized militia under US Code (the
National Guard is considered the \"organized militia\"). We don\'t
perform general muster to check everyone\'s weapons because it\'s simply
too time-consuming and costly.

Also remember that the phrase \"the right of the people\" was used three
times in the Bill of Rights, and each time it referred to an individual
right, not a right gained by membership in a group.

It is for these reasons that we interpret that the operative clause is
not limited by the phrasing in the prefatory clause.

*Surely we can all agree that an Abrams tank is excessive for self
defense.*

Excessive for whom? And under what circumstances? If I live on 3,000
acres and I choose to defend myself with an Abrams tank, why is that
excessive? If someone is shooting at me with a rifle, I bet I\'d be
pretty well protected inside my Abrams tank. And I could choose to use
my top-mounted SAW instead of the main gun on the tank, no? Perhaps if I
lived in downtown Manhattan it might be a little bit of overkill (no pun
intended). But circumstances matter.

*But isn\'t the amendment, according to the Heller interpretation,
arguing that citizens must be able to have Hellfire missiles too?*

We understand that the weaponry employed by the military has vastly
outstripped the weaponry available to citizens for their own
self-defense. But there are two things to note:

1.  We have the National Guard to defend us against Federal military
    overreach.
2.  There were other potential prefatory clauses that could have been
    added, but the framers chose one that was most forefront on the
    minds of the people at the time: \"you\'re all part of the
    militia.\" They could have chosen the one that says, \"A firearm,
    being necessary to the personal self-defense\" but they assumed that
    *everyone already knew that they had a natural right to
    self-defense.* It is only in the modern day that such things are
    questioned.

Sometimes, things are known for so long that when we ask ourselves
\"why\", we often find it hard to explain.
