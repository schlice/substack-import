There are no actual, physical copies of *anything* from that time. Those
originals are gone, as they don't last that long.

But books, even then, were *duplicated*. We didn't have copy machines or
printing presses, so books were duplicated by hand.

These duplications are called *manuscripts*.

All significant literature from the ancient world is reconstructed into
its original form by comparing the manuscripts that survive. To
reconstruct the original, it helps to have a large number of manuscripts
that are written not long after the original. More manuscripts and
earlier manuscripts usually provide more trustworthy testimony and
enable a more accurate reconstruction.

How do the New Testament documents fare in this regard? Extremely well,
and far better than anything else from the ancient world. In fact, the
New Testament documents have more manuscripts, earlier manuscripts, and
more abundantly supported manuscripts **than the best ten pieces of
classical literature** ***combined.*** Here's what we mean:

**More Manuscripts**---At last count, there are nearly 5,700 handwritten
Greek manuscripts of the New Testament. In addition, there are more than
9,000 manuscripts in other languages (e.g., Syriac, Coptic, Latin,
Arabic). Some of these nearly 15,000 manuscripts are complete Bibles,
others are books or pages, and a few are just fragments. There is
nothing from the ancient world that even comes close in terms of
manuscript support. The next closest work is the *Iliad* by Homer, with
643 manuscripts. Most other ancient works survive on fewer than a dozen
manuscripts, yet few historians question the historicity of the events
those works describe.

**Earlier Manuscripts**---Not only does the New Testament enjoy abundant
manuscript support, but it also has manuscripts that were written soon
after the originals. The earliest undisputed manuscript is a segment of
John 18:31-33, 37-38 known as the John Rylands fragment (because it's
housed in the John Rylands Library in Manchester, England). Scholars
date it between A.D. 117--138, but some say it is even earlier. It was
found in Egypt---across the Mediterranean from its probable place of
composition in Asia Minor---demonstrating that John's Gospel was copied
and had spread quite some distance by the early second century.

Even earlier than the John Rylands fragment are nine *disputed*
fragments that date from A.D. 50 to 70, found with the Dead Sea Scrolls.
Some scholars believe these fragments are parts of six New Testament
books including Mark, Acts, Romans, 1 Timothy, 2 Peter, and James. While
other scholars resist this conclusion (perhaps because its admission
would undermine their liberal leanings that the New Testament was
written later), they have not found any other non--New Testament texts
that these fragments could be.

The fragments were found in a cave that had previously been identified
as containing material from 50 B.C. to A.D. 50. The scholar who first
identified these early fragments as New Testament books was Jose
O'Callahan, a noted Spanish paleographer. The New York Times recognized
the implications of O'Callahan's theory by admitting that if it is true
"it would prove at least one of the Gospels---that of St. Mark---was
written only a few years after the death of Jesus."

But even if they are not true New Testament fragments and the John
Rylands fragment really is the earliest, the time gap between the
original and the first surviving copy is still vastly shorter than
anything else from the ancient world. The *Iliad* has the next shortest
gap at about 500 years; most other ancient works are 1,000 years or more
from the original. The New Testament gap is about 25 years and may be
less.

*NOTE: This does not mean there were no other manuscripts between the
original and the first copy; there most certainly were. It simply means
that those manuscripts have decayed, have been destroyed, or are still
undiscovered.*

How old are the oldest surviving manuscripts of complete New Testament
books? Manuscripts that are complete New Testament books survive from
about A.D. 200. How about the oldest manuscripts of the entire New
Testament? Most of the New Testament, including all of the Gospels,
survives from 250, and a manuscript of the entire New Testament
(including a Greek Old Testament) called *Codex Vaticanus* survives from
about 325. Several other complete manuscripts survive from that century.
And those manuscripts have spelling and punctuation characteristics that
suggest that they are in a family of manuscripts that can be traced back
to A.D. 100--150.

If these numerous and early manuscripts were all scholars had, they
could reconstruct the original New Testament with great accuracy. But
they also have abundant supporting evidence from the ancient world that
makes New Testament reconstruction even more certain.

**More Abundantly Supported Manuscripts**---Beginning in February of
A.D. 303, the Roman emperor Diocletian ordered three edicts of
persecution upon Christians because he believed that the existence of
Christianity was breaking the covenant between Rome and her gods. The
edicts called for the destruction of churches, manuscripts, and books
and the killing of Christians.

Hundreds if not thousands of manuscripts were destroyed across the Roman
Empire during this persecution, which lasted until A.D. 311. But even if
Diocletian had succeeded in wiping every biblical manuscript off the
face of the earth, he could not have destroyed our ability to
reconstruct the New Testament. Why? Because the early church
fathers---men of the second and third centuries such as Justin Martyr,
Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Tertullian, and others---quoted
the New Testament so much (36,289 times, to be exact) that *all but
eleven verses of the New Testament can be reconstructed just from their
quotations*.

In other words, you could Google the works of the early church fathers,
and read nearly the entire New Testament just from their quotations of
it! So we not only have thousands of manuscripts but thousands of
quotations from those manuscripts. This makes reconstruction of the
original text virtually certain.
