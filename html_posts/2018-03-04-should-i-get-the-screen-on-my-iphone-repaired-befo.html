Depends on how you get the screen repaired and what "trade-in" you're
talking about.

If you are talking about simply trading in your old device for a credit
towards a new one, the calculation is simple math: how much does it cost
to repair the screen vs. how much extra you'll get for a device with an
unbroken vs broken screen.

If you are talking about a program like T-Mobile's JUMP program, where
you trade in your old phone for a new one, you **must** have a phone
with an unbroken screen before you can turn it in. And you must have
your screen repaired by insurance, not the Fix-y guy in the mall. Check
with your carrier to validate this part.
