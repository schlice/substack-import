**If Trump was found to be colluding with Russians, does that make his
presidency illegitimate, and would all his doings be reversed?**

In short, even if Trump was found to have ***illegally paid*** the
Russians to swing the election in his favor, it would not make his
presidency illegitimate, it would not automatically invalidate any
Executive Orders he has signed, nor would it invalidate any bills he may
have signed into law.

First, we have already determined that no votes were changed, and no US
citizens were prevented from voting. Therefore, ***we have already
determined that the election was legal, and the election results are
final***. Trump is a legitimate president, and the US presidential
election process was not tampered with.

In fact, there is nothing that *automatically* makes a president
illegitimate. **If the people voted for the president, the presidency is
legitimate.**

Therefore, the only thing that the Russians could have "hacked" is the
mind of the voter. To that end, we're talking about who is allowed to
purchase advertising and who is allowed to talk to US citizens about US
elections. And incidentally, we're also assuming that US voters are so
dumb that they are easily swayed by advertising.

The question, therefore, is *did Trump ask Russians to buy advertising
to try to sway voters to vote for him, and if he did, did he pay them to
do it?*

If Trump ***paid*** Russians using campaign money, he may be guilty of
violating campaign finance laws. Even this does not automatically make
the president illegitimate. The president's presidency is still legal
and legitimate.

If he did not pay Russians, but instead ***asked*** them to swing the
election in his favor (in other words, "collude" with them to try to
influence Americans to vote for him instead of Clinton), and they did
this without being paid, how is this any different from when [[Americans
have interfered in other foreign
elections](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=37fe5c&url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/10/13/the-long-history-of-the-u-s-interfering-with-elections-elsewhere/?utm_term%3D.1558ccae67ba){.external_link

Perhaps you believe this action is not in keeping with the office of the
President. Your only recourse is to impeach the President, claiming that
such antics constitute "conduct unbecoming of the office of President."
2/3 of the House must agree to impeach, and then 2/3 of the Senate must
agree that the impeached offense is severe enough that you need to be
removed from office.
