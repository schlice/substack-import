**Content:** [It\'s been answered already, but let me re-iterate your
best plan of action.\
\
1. Certified letter to the landlord indicating that there is a health
issue in the apartment and it is causing uninhabitable conditions in
your apartment. Tell them that you are taking action to involve state
and local agencies of the potential hazard to you and to the health of
the tenant in question because they have failed to act.\
\
2. Notify state and/or local agencies of the issue. APS is the best
route to go. You can also contact the police and tell them you think
there is a dead body in there because of the smell, but please save that
as a last resort. Please try state health agencies first. They can
compel the landlord to act better than you can.\
\
3. If no action has been taken in 30 days, certified cure-or-quit notice
to the landlord indicating that they have violated the terms of your
lease by not providing habitable conditions to you. Provide them with a
dated copy of the first letter. You give your landlord 14 days from the
date they receive the letter to \"cure\" the condition causing default
or you will \"quit\" (terminate) your lease because they have violated
the leasing terms. Consult with a lawyer before moving out to make sure
you have your legal bases covered, but if you\'ve already done 1 and 2
above, you should have enough collateral to prove your case.\
\
4. If you still get no response from the landlord, filing a complaint
with the local BBB is a good one. Also, join Angie\'s List. It\'s
inexpensive, and business owners do not like negative reviews there. And
then keep to your promise and move out.]{.rendered_qtext}
