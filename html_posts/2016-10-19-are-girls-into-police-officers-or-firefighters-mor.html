My training sergeant said, on our first day, "People don\'t become
police officers to be loved. If you want to be loved, be a firefighter."

Firefighters universally come to save you. Police come to either protect
you, or send you to jail. Firefighters are generally fit and healthy
because of the physicality of their jobs, police are sometimes not
required to meet fitness standards. Finally, police officers remind
people that there are consequences for their actions. That doesn\'t sit
well with people, even if what they did was actually wrong.
