In the vast majority of cases in the United States, you can film anyone
in public, including the police.

The general rule of thumb is, "If you can see it, you can film it."

Specific to the police, if they are in public and so are you, film away.
But be respectful: stay back from active police activity. Never
interfere with what an officer is doing while you record. Don't be one
of "those people" who shove their phones in police officers' faces.
That's just a douche-y move.

Legislation has been introduced in some states to enforce sensible
distance requirements for those filming, but it has yet to gain any real
traction. Just be a human while you record, and you can fill up your
phone's memory all you like.

Also, obey police orders. Don't try to argue Constitutional protections
with a police officer performing his or her duties. If an officer tells
you to move, you move. If they tell you to back up to the other side of
the street, you do it. If they tell you to stop recording, you do it. If
you think you just recorded a police officer trampling on your rights,
you should run, don't walk, to your nearest civil rights attorney or
ACLU office and show them the video. Perhaps you'll make a windfall in a
lawsuit against the police department (fair warning: perhaps not).
