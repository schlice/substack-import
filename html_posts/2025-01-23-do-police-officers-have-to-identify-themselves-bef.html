The only reason a police officer would ask for your consent to search
your home or property is because they don't have a warrant.

If they have a valid warrant, they don't need your consent. The only
reason they would ask you anything at all is so they don't break your
doors down.

And I'd suggest getting identification before you let anyone you don't
know into your house, especially if they're asking to search your house.
And in that case, you should be asking to see their warrant.
