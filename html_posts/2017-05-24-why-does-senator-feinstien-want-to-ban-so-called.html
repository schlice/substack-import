1.  Today's Democrats support measures which **feel** good. Today's
    Republicans support measures which **do** good. Any Democrat who is
    seen as doing something which "feels" good or "feels" right is going
    to get votes. Republicans don't support such measures because they
    don't **do** any good. They don't make people safer. They don't
    reduce crime. They don't keep weapons out of the hands of criminals.
    They only restrict the rights of law-abiding citizens.
2.  There's a great deal of confusion (which they actually caused)
    around "assault weapons." They have banned "scary-looking" guns and
    their attachments, which have absolutely zero bearing on their
    function. Democrats are attempting to sow that confusion, and then
    capitalize on it. If they can get people confused enough about what
    an assault weapon is, they can gin up enough support to sneak some
    bans through.

So while they can't wholesale ban firearms (which is actually their
ultimate goal), they can attempt to chip away at gun rights until there
are simply so many regulations that they are functionally banned. This
is why the NRA and their Institute for Legislative Action as well as
many other grassroots organizations must keep fighting. If they back
off, Democrats will be able to get their foot in the door and get
nonsense legislation passed, which is the beginning of the end for the
right.

They know they've lost the battle with handguns, so they have switched
to assault weapons, attempting to capitalize on that confusion.
