**Should the military retirement pay received by military former spouses
be subject to garnishment to pay child support owed to service members
by the former spouse?**

So I'm trying to understand your wording. Let's try to deconstruct what
you asked.

You said "should the pay received by military former spouses". Spouses
of military members are not paid. So if you are a former spouse of a
military member and you are being paid, it is by court order. This
court-ordered payment is often referred to as "alimony" or "maintenance"
(depending on what state you live in).

Then you said that the pay would be "garnished" to pay child support
owed to the service member by the former spouse.

In this case, the money is already going to the service member. It
sounds like what is happening, therefore, is that your maintenance is
being reduced by the amount of the child support owed by you to the
servicemember.

This is not a military pay issue, and it is not a "garnishment" issue,
as garnishment is a function which can be applied directly to military
pay. This is purely a legal, court issue. If you are receiving
maintenance payments, it is from a court order, not from the government.
That pay does not get "garnished," but it can be reduced if you, in
turn, owe child support payments back to the servicemember who is paying
you maintenance money.

If this reduction in your maintenance was not done through a court
order, you should contact your attorney and advise him of everything
that is going on, including what you owe in child support and how much
you have paid, along with canceled checks. The servicemember does not
have the right to unilaterally ignore court-determined maintenance just
because you owe child support payments. It would be up to the
servicemember to return to court to re-negotiate a reduction in
maintenance in order to satisfy both his maintenance requirement, and
your child support requirement. The court can order your maintenance be
reduced by the amount of child support you owe, but that's up to the
court to decide. If the servicemember is doing this on his own, tell
your lawyer. It's up to a judge to make that determination.
