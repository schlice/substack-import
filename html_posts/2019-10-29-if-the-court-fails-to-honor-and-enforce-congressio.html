**If the court fails to honor and enforce Congressional subpoenas does
this set precedence for their own to be dishonored?**

As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."

And what it depends on is *why* the court fails to honor Congressional
subpoenas.

So *if* the court finds that a subpoena is not enforceable, you have to
determine the court's rationale. Does the subpoena follow the rules the
body itself has set out, including the body's own precedents? And if it
is changing that precedent, has it gone through the appropriate body
process to do that? Is the subpoena authorized by the charter of the
body requesting it? For example, can the Ways and Means committee do a
criminal investigation? Unlikely, since it it outside of their charter.

If the legitimacy of a subpoena is appealed to the Supreme Court, and
they decide to hear the case, then they will be right. Remember, SCOTUS
is not the last word because they're always right; SCOTUS is always
right because they're the last word.
