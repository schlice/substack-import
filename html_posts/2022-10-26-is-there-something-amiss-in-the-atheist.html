Yes.

It is a problem wherein atheists are pre-loading their conclusions into
their assumptions. They consider Jesus to be "only a man" because they
have a pre-existing conclusion that God does not exist, so any evidence
we present that Jesus was both God and man is going to fall on deaf
ears. Jesus must be only a man, because they consider no other options.

There is also (as you will see in many answers to this question) the
idea that only certain evidence is acceptable. You're going to get a lot
of "WHAT EVIDENCE? SHOW ME THE EVIDENCE!" answers, when the truth is
that evidence has been presented many many times, but they simply refuse
to accept that evidence.

The reason they won't accept the evidence is that it is philosophical
and logical evidence, not physical evidence. You can't "detect" God
using any physical means. You can't "measure" God. These people are what
we call "naturalists" or "materialists" because they believe in
naturalism (materialism) as the foundation of all life.

Materialism is false for a number of reasons.

- There are plenty of things that you can't "detect" but we still
  believe exist. Human thoughts and theories aren't comprised only of
  measurable chemicals. Sure, chemicals are involved in the process, but
  they can't explain all of human thought. Someone's thoughts, whether
  they be of love or hate, are not chemicals. What is the specific
  gravity of love? What is the chemical composition of hate? These are
  absurd questions because thoughts and emotions are not completely
  materially-based. Since they are not completely materially-based,
  materialism is false.
- There is a message resident in all life, what we technically call
  "specified complexity." Specified complexity cannot be explained
  materially. The message cannot be explained by non-intelligent natural
  laws any more than the words on this screen can be explained by the
  non-intelligent laws of the motion of electrons.
- If life were nothing more than a random interaction of chemicals, then
  we should be able to take those chemicals and combine them and create
  life, but we cannot. Clearly, there is something more to life beyond
  the materials that comprise living beings. Materialists, for example,
  can't explain why one person is alive and another is dead. They
  contain the same chemicals. Why is a person alive one minute and dead
  the next? What combination of chemicals can account for consciousness?
- Finally, if materialism were true, then reason is impossible. If
  mental processes are nothing more than chemical interactions in the
  brain, then there is no reason to believe that *anything* is true,
  including the theory of materialism itself. Chemicals can't evaluate
  whether or not a theory is true. Chemicals can't *reason*, they can
  only *react*.

Materialists rule out the possibility that Jesus could be God before
they even evaluate the evidence. Doing so literally flies in the face of
science and reason. This isn't a debate between science and religion.
This is a debate between *good science* and *bad science*. Similarly,
this isn't a debate between faith and reason. This is a debate between
*reasonable faith* and *unreasonable faith*.

It might surprise you to see who is actually practicing bad science, and
who has the more unreasonable faith.

Original question:

Is there something amiss in the atheist's reasoning that Jesus is
fiction if he is the son of God and real if he was only a man, based on
the axis that they don't believe that Gods exist? Isn't that dismissing
the evidence before evaluating it?
