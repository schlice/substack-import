Short answer: no.

Longer answer: Police are required to protect the safety of the general
public. However, unless there is a pre-existing agreement (i.e. you are
being detained by the police), the police have no obligation to protect
you personally.

Many Supreme Court cases over the years have borne out this principle.
In 1989, the Supreme Court said that \"\[n\]othing in the language of
the Due Process Clause itself requires the State to protect the life,
liberty, and property of its citizens against invasion by private
actors.\" The Due Process clause of the 14th Amendment forbids the
government to deprive citizens of life, liberty, or property without
\"due process of law.\" Conversely, the Due Process clause does not
provide an affirmative right to government assistance, \"even where such
aid may be necessary to secure life, liberty, or property interests of
which the government itself may not deprive the individual.\" So while
the government is specifically enjoined from depriving any citizen of
the rights to life, liberty, and property, this does not create a
converse relationship; simply because the government can\'t take it away
doesn\'t mean the government must protect it.

Now, all that said, the police will do their utmost to protect you, as
quickly and as safely as they can.
