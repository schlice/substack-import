**Which laws are being violated by the current House impeachment
proceedings? Can you cite them?**

No laws are being violated. The House is free to conduct investigations
as it sees fit. They don't need any investigations *at all*; they can
simply bring Articles of Impeachment to the floor and vote on them and
pass them on a party-line vote. The Constitution imposes no restrictions
on how the House conducts impeachment inquiries, or even whether or not
an inquiry needs to take place *at all*.

That said, actions have consequences.

If we were to compare how this House is conducing this impeachment
inquiry as opposed to how other Houses have conducted impeachment
inquiries, we would find some interesting contrasts. The investigation
prior to Nixon's investigation was undertaken by the Senate Watergate
Committee, which was bipartisan, and all members had equal authority.
The Clinton impeachment was undertaken after Independent Counsel Ken
Starr released his report which was originally surrounding the
Whitewater scandal.

In this case, there was no special investigative committee formed. There
was no Independent Counsel (unless you count Special Counsel Robert
Mueller's investigation into the Russia collusion hoax). In this case,
House subcommittes are using their oversight power to attempt to run an
impeachment inquiry, which is of questionable legal status anyway,
despite the fact that a lower court has upheld some of the subpoenas
already (currently subject to appeal). The functioning of a subcommittee
investigation is not the same as a special committee investigation. It
does not allow bipartisan participation in the investigative process,
even though members from both parties are seated on the committee. In
this way, Speaker Pelosi can claim that the investigation was
"bipartisan" without stating the full truth that the investigation was
actually quite partisan in its function.

The rules for which the House voted last week are surprisingly different
than any other impeachment inquiry that has ever been undertaken by a
House. Among other procedural irregularities, they allow evidence to be
suppressed by the Committee chair. Republicans wanted to see some
semblance of a "fair and equitable process" laid out, and they believe
there wasn't one. Besides, since only a simple majority is needed to
pass both the procedural vote and Articles of Impeachment, Republicans
instead used the occasion to vote *en masse* and signal their
disapproval of impeachment in general, and this motion in specific.

The only consequence to impeachment: each Member must go on record as to
whether or not they approve of Articles of Impeachment and they will be
judged by that vote. And there are several Democrats who won in 2018 in
districts carried by the President during the general election in 2016.
These Democrats are going to have to do some soul searching before they
vote to authorize an impeachment inquiry, and they're going to have to
think how that vote will play in a majority Trump voting district back
home. Voters have shown that they will hold Members accountable for
their actions while in Congress, and many Americans are upset that other
legislative priorities are being ignored, such as voting on the
replacement for NAFTA (yet another one that those same Democrats are
going to pay for if they vote against).
