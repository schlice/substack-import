Why do you have to know whose life you have blessed? Can't you bless a
life without even knowing it? Do you have to know whose life you blessed
in order to have done so? Does it change the blessing at all? Can't you
still be a good person to everyone you meet, even if you never find out
that you blessed their lives in some way?

General George S. Patton, Jr. said, "There is no limit to the good you
can do if you don't care who gets the credit."

Think about *that.*
