Hamas is going for *shock value*, which is exactly what they got. But
they expected *more of the same* reaction from Israel, which is **not**
what they are going to get.

The IDF is going to go into Gaza, and they are going to go
house-by-house, building-by-building, picking slowly and painstakingly
through each and every one, separating out the unwitting civilian human
shields, and killing the Hamas terrorists. They will have to flood all
of the underground tunnels that Hamas built to move around freely
without attracting unwanted IDF attention. They will have to manually
excise Hamas from the picture completely, without simply glassing the
entirety of the Gaza Strip, which they will not do.

When they are done, they will likely offer the remaining people in Gaza
the same choice they did after the Six Day War: *if you accept Israel's
sovereignty and right to exist, and accept Israeli control over this
land, you can live here, freely, in peace, as full citizens of Israel.*
It's a great deal. For the Arabs in Gaza, they'd be among the only Arabs
living as full citizens in a European democracy. And just as after the
Six Day War, some will take that deal.

Others will not, and this time, they will be asked to leave. Which is a
problem for Israel, because *none of the "enlightened" Arab nations
around Israel wants to take them*. Those Arab nations want to continue
using them as pawns to either expand Arab rule in the region, or use
them as an excuse to invade Israel. They desperately want those Arabs to
stay in Israel, but in defiance of Israel. They want those Arabs to be
the foothold they keep within Israel, or be the canaries in the cages
who die at Israel's hand, and become the justification for a full-scale
invasion of Israel. Accordingly, Israel cannot afford to keep them there
in that condition any longer. They must either swear allegiance to
Israel, or leave. The bloodshed must stop.

The bottom line is this: *Israelis are tired of war.* They are tired of
rockets. They are tired of suicide bombers. They just want it all to
stop and everyone to live in peace. Hamas was tired of living in *what
they see* as an open-air prison, even though it is a prison of their own
making.

The truth about the situation in Israel is this:

*If Hamas lays down their guns today, there will be no more war.\
If the Jews lay down their guns today, there will be no more Jews.*

Think about that.
