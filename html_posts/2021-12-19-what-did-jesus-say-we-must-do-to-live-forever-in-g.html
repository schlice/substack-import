**Repent** and **believe.**

The concept is amazingly simple, and is part of the reason that
Christianity is so appealing: you literally don't have to do anything
special.

Let's go through this two-part process now:

1.  **Repent**. What is repentance, anyway? It translates as a *turning
    away.* It is a turning which is so complete as to essentially turn
    away from your past life and turn towards a new life. Repentance
    involves ***recognition*** *of sin and* ***resolution*** *to live
    without sin.* It is an intention towards action. It is a deliberate
    understanding of the underlying sinful condition and a deliberate
    turning away from it. Repentance is an action word which demands
    action to consciously recognize and turn away from sin and turn
    towards God.
2.  **Believe**. Sounds easy, right? Well, in essence, it is. Belief is
    actually better stated as "belief that Jesus is your Lord and savior
    and died as a penal substitution to pay for your sins." It is an
    acknowledgement that your life belongs to Christ, and you want him
    to direct your thoughts and deeds.

That's it. No more, no less. Repent and believe.

Original question:

What did Jesus say we must do to live forever in God's eternal kingdom?
Is it also how our names get written in the Book of Life?
