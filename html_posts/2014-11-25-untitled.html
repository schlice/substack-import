<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [\" I would posit that the black cop would not have
antagonized the residents to the point where such incidences like this
would have happened. The black cop would have probably been from the
neighborhood, and would have not had a reputation of being a
stormtrooper looking for people to hassle.\"\
\
Charlotte, you\'ve got it backwards. The police presence does not cause
crime. The police are called after something already happens. The police
are called after the crime happens, not before. The police aren\'t
roaming around the neighborhood saying, \"hey, let\'s find a little
black kid to kill.\" If you really believe this, then there is nothing
that can convince you that the boogeyman isn\'t right around the corner
waiting to snatch you away in the night and throw you back into the
chains of slavery.\

Really?\

I thought race relations have come so much farther than that in the last
70 years.]{.rendered_qtext}
