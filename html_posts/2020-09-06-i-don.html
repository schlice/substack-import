**I don't live with my mother anymore, but my dad still has to pay child
support for me. Is there a way I can get that child support? I'm 18 and
live in NY.**

Sure. Talk to your dad.

In New York, if you are living on your own, you can be legally
considered "emancipated" and he would no longer have to pay money to
your mom.

And maybe, if he doesn\'t have to pay her anymore, he can help you out
instead. But if you are declared emancipated, no one is *owed* anything.

Remember, child support is to help the lower income parent with your
support. When you no longer need support, the obligation ends. So your
dad would have to help you because he wants to, not because he has to.
