Sure, anything is possible. But it is highly unlikely. Living a lie is
not mentally healthy for anyone, and eventually it will catch up to you.
Being forced to live in cognitive dissonance, violating the very tenets
of your own belief, just to keep your job, isn't good for anyone, let
alone a priest or a pastor who is supposed to be guiding other people
through the tenets of a faith in which they themselves do not believe.

You're literally claiming that a priest or a pastor does not practice
what they preach. While it's certainly possible, I find it unlikely.
