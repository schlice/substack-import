Under current DOD regulations (which match the Commander in Chief's
orders), servicemembers will serve as the sex listed on their original
birth certificate, and if the certificate does not exist or if the
servicemember disagrees with what is listed on their birth certificate,
the sex indicated by scientific analysis will be used.

To conduct a scientific analysis, doctors will use chromosomal analysis
to determine if the presence or absence of the Y chromosome matches the
expression of the external genitalia. If the genitalia matches the
presence/absence of the Y chromosome, the military will use that
determination to establish a biological sex.

Whether that matches the servicemember's *understanding* of their own
sex is irrelevant. If their external sex organs show them as male, and
they have a Y chromosome in enough abundance to conclusively classify
them as male, then they are considered male and if they serve, will
serve as male, even if they believe they are female.
