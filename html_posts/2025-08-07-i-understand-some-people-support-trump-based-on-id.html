**I understand some people support Trump based on ideological leanings,
but couldn\'t many of his followers be accurately classified as a
cult?**

No, for several reasons.

First of all, you might be able to call some Trump supporters as a
"cult," like the usage of the term "cult of personality." In the same
way,
"[[Beliebers](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a08e4b&url=https://justinbieber.fandom.com/wiki/Belieber){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="fandom.com"}]{.qlink_container}" are a cult.

But you used the nebulous term "many" and I'm not so sure that we agree
on exactly how many Trump supporters constitutes "many," and I'm also
not so sure you have a 100% accurate read on Trump supporters. I'm sure
anecdotally you've seen a few Trump supporters in your area, but I don't
think you have a good enough read of all Trump supporters to be able to
claim that "many" of his followers behave as if they are in a cult.
