**Is it illegal to misrepresent your identity to non-authorities?**

It is only illegal to misrepresent your identity to police and federal
agents.

To anyone else, and about anything else, it's not illegal to lie. You
can claim whatever you choose to claim in order to get whatever you
want.

I might qualify that you must also not lie on official documentation.
For example, if you're filling out a job application or if you're trying
to get a loan, you can't lie on those forms.

I also don't think you were talking about misrepresenting your identity
*and actually attempting to perform the role of your misrepresented
identity*. You know that misrepresenting yourself as a police officer or
a doctor *and then attempting to perform police functions or attempting
to practice medicine* will get you thrown in jail.

But in the situations you discussed (for example, claiming you're a
movie producer instead of a journalist in order to get "insider"
information), there are no legal requirements to tell the truth.
