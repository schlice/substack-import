**What should you do when someone on Quora continuously forces you to
give your cellphone number?**

How does anyone "force" you to give your cell phone number? How does
anyone "force" you to do anything on Quora, other than follow the rules
when you choose to participate?

Is perhaps someone continuously requesting you to give your phone
number?

Do this, in this order:

1.  Tell them no
2.  Mute/Block them
3.  Report them
