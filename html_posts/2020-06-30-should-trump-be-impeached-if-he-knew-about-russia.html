**Should Trump be impeached if he knew about Russia\'s Taliban
bounties?**

Nope.

Impeachment is very serious. It is reserved for *high crimes and
misdemeanors*. It is reserved for the lawlessness that is *so pervasive,
so damaging to the Office of the President* that the current occupant of
that office can no longer effectively administer the office.

No, the remedy for what you ask is to *not re-elect him in November, and
to encourage your friends to do the same*. Tell them about Trump's
knowledge of Russian Taliban bounties. And if they agree with you, have
them tell even more people about it.

Our remedy for an ineffective president is at the ballot box. ***We***
have the power to get Trump out of office in just a little over four
months from now. Don't leave it up to Congress to do your job. If you
don't want Trump in office, don't re-elect him.
