***Slowly, cautiously, and under the supervision of your medical
team.***

It's well known that smoking not only makes people who were already
predisposed to developing MS even more likely to develop it, but it is
also well known that quitting smoking will improve your overall MS
prognosis. You will progress to disability at a slower rate after you
quit, and your relapses will not be nearly as bad nor last as long. The
disease itself will also progress at a slower rate.

I would highly suggest that you not try to rush the process. Don't quit
"cold turkey." Doing so is stressful, and stress brings on relapses.

What I **do** recommend is talking to your medical team. Advise them
that you want to quit, but relapses often accompany your attempts. They
can work with you to lessen the effects of quitting so as to alleviate
some of the stress in the process.

There are definitely products out there that can help make quitting less
painful: antidepressants (bupropion), varenicline, nicotine patches and
gum all are available. [\[1\]](#cZuEZ){#cite-cZuEZ
.citation_link}Working with your healthcare team (primarily your GP and
your neurologist) will be crucial in making sure you can control the
side effects from smoking cessation so that you can work through the MS
issues.

And it may just be possible that in order to quit, you may have to
endure a relapse. Remember that a relapse does not indicate disease
progression; in other words, you are not making your disease worse by
enduring a relapse. However, in the grand scheme of things, it's better
to quit than to fear quitting because of a relapse.

In other words, **the benefits of quitting far outweigh the risks
involved in doing so.**

Talk to your medical team, and see if there are supportive therapies
that can help you quit, and be successful.
