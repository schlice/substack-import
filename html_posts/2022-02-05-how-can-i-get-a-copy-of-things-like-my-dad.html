I think the form you are looking for is the DD-214, which is your
discharge letter from the military. It shows the dates of service, how
long you served on active duty, what station you separated from, what
was your characterization of separation (usually honorable), under what
rule you separated (usually completion of active duty service), and then
lists all of your "Awards and Decs" or all of your medals and
decorations. It does not show a chronological history of every duty
station you ever served at. You can retrieve all of those records
(including the DD-214) from the National Personnel Records Center
(NPRC), part of the National Archives.

If he separated or retired before October 1, 2004, his records will be
at the NPRC. If he separated after that, his records will still be at
the Air Force Personnel Center, and you can submit a records request as
next-of-kin to them.

But for NPRC records, you can use the
[[eVetRecs](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=11bb67&url=https://vetrecs.archives.gov/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="archives.gov"}]{.qlink_container} system from the National
Archives to generate the records request. You will still need to mail or
fax the form to the NPRC. The eVetRecs site will help you with what to
do with the form.

Original question:

How can I get a copy of things like my dad\'s WW2 DD14? He was a B-17
pilot in the 8th Air Force, and I remember seeing records of his bombing
missions and medals, but I don\'t remember what it was that he showed me
before he died in 1991.
