**Content:** [I think you\'d have to ask yourself why you\'re angry at
an entire group of people when it\'s likely that you\'re just angry at a
few people who do not represent the thoughts, feelings, and actions of
the whole.\
\
Why do you look at their actions and *judge* them, as a group, for what
a small few have done?\
\
More specifically, what have they (as individuals or as a group) done to
*you specifically* to make you angry?\
\
While I never like to tell someone that their feelings are wrong, I will
tell you that your feelings are likely *misplaced*. You probably
shouldn\'t be angry at all black people. You should probably be angry at
the few who make the whole look bad.\
\
I\'m angry at the stupid whites who go shooting up churches and make all
whites look bad. I\'m not mad at all whites, or all Southerners for that
matter. I\'m not really even mad at the mentally ill person who does
horrid things. I\'m more mad that we developed a system in this country
which made it so difficult and so stigmatized that mentally ill people
who are not dangerous enough to be hospitalized can fester without help
until they do snap. ***That*** is a travesty.]{.rendered_qtext}
