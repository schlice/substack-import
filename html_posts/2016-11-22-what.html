I actually got this one from Dr. Phil.

Put a sticky note on your bathroom mirror (something you'll see every
day, first thing in the morning). It should say:

***What can I do TODAY that will make my family's life just a little bit
better?***

It doesn't matter the size of your family (which will likely grow), you
will always be able to do this. When you see your sticky note in the
morning, think of one thing that you can do to make your wife (or your
family) a little happier, or make their life a little better, that day.
It doesn't have to be a big thing. Little things, every day, will add up
immensely.

For your wife, you know the little things she likes. Maybe it's a
certain flavor coffee from Starbucks. Maybe it's a text to her at
lunchtime to let her know you're thinking of her. One little thing,
every day. It's more important than just making her happy every day. It
has lasting benefits.

One of those lasting benefits is preparing for the bad times. It's great
to talk about the good times, but bad times will come your way (as they
do in every marriage). I know it's hard to think that bad things will
ever happen (as is true of the beginning of every marriage), but bad
things will happen, and you should be prepared for them. Sometimes, when
the bad things pile up, it's hard to remember that there is still good
there. Bad things in your marriage are like clouds that cover the sun.
It's important that you still remember that the sun is still there, it's
just covered up. The more good things you do with and for each other,
the easier it will be to remember those things when bad things happen.
