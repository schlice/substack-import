**Content:** [I know you based on our previous discussions, and I know
you do get it.\

If you just feel for the kid, say so. That makes more sense. Your
comments make it sound like you disagree with UCMJ\'s restrictions on
drug use because it is becoming \"normalized\" in society. UCMJ can\'t
be any less strict than the most strict prevailing law, which is
currently Federal law. So until Federal law changes, UCMJ can\'t change
either.\

I understand you feel for him. I do not. He was arrested once and at
that time, he was told that regardless of state law, drug use in the
military is illegal. Do it again and you will be headed home. What did
he do? He did it again. That\'s either a sign of stupidity, or willful
ignorance, both of which run counter to good order and discipline, which
we definitely don\'t need in the military.]{.rendered_qtext}
