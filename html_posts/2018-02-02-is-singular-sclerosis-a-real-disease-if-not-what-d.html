MS is a disease by which the immune system malfunctions and attacks the
myelin sheath surrounding nerve fibers. This is a process called
**demyelination.**

What is left following this process of demyelination are scars or
plaques called **scleroses**, composed mainly of cholesterol, past which
nerve signals do not pass effectively. This degraded transmission of
nerve signals is the primary driver of MS symptoms.

The name "multiple sclerosis" literally means "many scars."

It would be extremely rare to have a single scar and experience a
noticeable symptom. Symptoms occur because of a group of scars in one
particular area. Nearly everyone who has MS has more than one scar.
Indeed, each lesion is actually a collection of smaller individual scars
on nerve fibers.
