The Biden Administration is not attempting to put pressure on Hamas. The
Biden Administration is attempting to put pressure on Israel.

Their focus, as of late, has been trying to get Israel to stop its
counter-offensive against Hamas. Israel, for its part, rightly claims
its right to self-defense, and that the attack by Hamas was an act of
war against the state of Israel. Israel has legally declared war against
Hamas, and calls for Israeli restraint have been met with examples of
how Israel is not indiscriminate with its operations. In fact, the IDF
has taken great pains to ensure that non-combatants are not harmed. This
does not mean that there will be no civilian casualties, just that
Israel is taking a very slow, methodical approach to attacking Hamas.

One example of this is how they are choosing to flush Hamas out of their
network of tunnels: flooding them with seawater. The influx of seawater
is gradual enough to simply make the tunnel network unusable, not to
kill everyone inside by making the tunnels impassable. It's to force
Hamas to evacuate everyone from the tunnel network and to make the
tunnels as unusable as possible. If Israel was being indiscriminate,
they would have used mustard gas or fuel-air bombs in the tunnel
network. They have instead chosen to flood the tunnels to force Hamas
out.

But even if they wanted to, the US really has no control over Hamas.
Hamas is literally laser-focused on the destruction of Israel and the
complete genocide of every Israeli in the region. I mean, it's even in
their slogans. "From the river to the sea" literally means from the
Jordan to the Mediterranean. For those in the cheap seats, *that's all
of Israel*. Anyone who chants "from the river to the sea" is advocating
for the complete genocide of all Israelis. Genocide, by any country, is
never a valid wartime tactic.
