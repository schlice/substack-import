**Content:** [That\'s not true at all. Android phones are more prone to
viruses because Google has fewer controls on what apps end up in the
Google Play store. There has been more than one occasion when a
malicious app has ended up in the Google Play store and has been
distributed.\

The Apple App Store has much tighter quality controls around the apps
