All elective abortions are illegal after six weeks, and there are no
exceptions for rape or incest.

Texas has one of the most stringent abortion laws in the country. If you
go into a Planned Parenthood abortion provider in Texas and you don\'t
qualify, they have resources available to help you get to a state which
will perform the abortion. New Mexico or Colorado are two states nearby
where you can go to get your abortion.
