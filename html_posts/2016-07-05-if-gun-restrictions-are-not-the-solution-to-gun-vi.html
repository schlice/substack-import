"Gun violence" is a bad phrase. When you use that phrase, you tend to
put the focus on the "gun" instead of the "violence." Then, to stop the
"violence," you simply need to remove the "gun," and the "violence"
magically disappears.

As if the gun has some magical quality that causes people to commit
violence.

It's almost like the phrase leads you to believe that if you could
simply get rid of that pesky gun, the violence would somehow stop.

**The phrase leads you to believe that the gun causes the violence.**

*This simply is not true.*

**Guns do not cause violence**. Guns are nothing more than tools. They
are popular targets to score political points because guns are the only
tools available specifically designed to kill. No other tool that can
kill was specifically designed to kill (the knife may be an exception,
but in its current form, it is far more useful as a non-killing tool
than its ancestor). And I'm talking about portable personal weapons; I'm
not talking about other tools designed to kill like the electric chair.

I'm also going to tell you something that you already knew:

**You can stop gun violence by getting rid of guns.**

It's amazing. If you get rid of guns, you won't have gun violence
anymore! If you could somehow magically make 300 million guns disappear,
there would be no more gun violence!

However

You will still have ***knife*** *violence* and ***frying pan***
*violence* and ***baseball bat*** *violence* and ***suicide vest***
*violence* and ***truck bomb*** *violence* and ***car*** *violence* and
all manner of other violence that is completely unrelated to guns. The
Orlando night club *shooting* would have been the Orlando night club
*bombing* if the gun wasn't there (some reports said that Mateen was in
fact wearing a suicide vest, but it may very well have been a tac vest
that someone didn't recognize). The actual death toll would have been
higher if it wasn't for the gun limiting the damage done. You would have
had ***hundreds*** dead instead of 49.

So the question becomes: which problem do you want to solve? The problem
of "gun," or the problem of "violence?"

It's true, solving the problem of why people are violent towards each
other in such high numbers is a *hard problem to solve*. It really is.
So why not just start with the gun? Why not just get the "low-hanging
fruit" and reduce some violence by getting rid of guns?

There are several reasons why it makes no sense to get rid of guns.

1.  **Getting rid of guns will not get rid of violence.** As I've
    already alluded to, even if you were able to magically make 300
    million guns vanish, people will still kill people. Every. Single.
    Day. Getting rid of guns will solve nothing in terms of stopping
    people from acting violently towards each other. Yes, it's a hard
    problem, but let's make sure we focus on the real problem.
2.  **99.9% of gun owners are not violent killers.** Taking guns away
    from everyone simply disarms lots and lots of honest, law-abiding
    citizens. It might stop a handful of gun-related crimes because a
    criminal was not able to steal a gun from a law-abiding citizen, but
    the vast majority of illegal guns are not stolen. They are straw
    purchases or illegal imports. So the criminal element will still
    have guns. Now all you've done is created more soft targets for the
    crazies to hit. Just like gun-free zones have done, you've created a
    place where a looney can go shoot with abandon, knowing he'll not
    face any armed resistance from any law-abiding citizens. Look, they
    may be looney, they may be wacko, they may have a warped sense of
    right and wrong, but they're not stupid. Not by any stretch of the
    imagination. They want to kill lots of people. So where do they go?
    Places where they can kill the largest number of people before
    meeting any armed resistance.\
    \
    Anyway, disarming the vast law-abiding population doesn't really
    affect gun violence at all. There are estimated to be about two
    million defensive gun uses each year, and many of them take place
    without a single shot being fired. The mere presence of a defensive
    weapon will cause many criminals who only want soft targets and no
    resistance to turn tail and run. Removing guns from the population
    leaves these millions of gun owners defenseless against crime.

**TL;DR: You're addressing the wrong term. Don't address the gun.
Address the violence.**

(EDIT) The OP apparently thought my answer was disingenuous. In the
comments, he/she anonymously stated, "This was a genuine question about
reducing the amount of people murdered each year (the vast majorty
\[sic\] of whom die from a wound inflicted by a gun) in the United
States."

So let's dissect the numbers, shall we?

Each year, about 33,000 people die from a wound inflicted by a gun.
Two-thirds of those are suicides. The OP is concerned only with murders,
so let's discount the problem of suicide using a gun. That leaves us
with 11,000 people killed by guns. Nearly 8,000 of those remaining are
criminals killed by other criminals in the course of some criminal
activity (i.e. a drug deal gone bad). But a murder is a murder, so let's
include the numbers of criminals killing each other in criminal activity
in the "murder" category.

Here's where that falls on the scale of "preventable" deaths:

master_w="2000" master_h="1300"}
:::
::::

Note that the number used for the graph (33,000) includes suicides
involving firearms, and we didn't really want to consider that. If we
remove suicide from the mix so we're only looking at murder, it probably
falls somewhere below drug abuses in terms of preventable deaths.

***In other words, murders caused by a gun barely moves the needle.***

There are far more poignant causes you can rally behind, **especially
considering that none of the other preventable causes of death are
protected by the Constitution.**

So why do we fight so hard against guns? Indeed, 11,000 people murdered
with guns is a high number, but when I see people using these numbers to
advocate either complete or partial firearm bans, I always wonder: What
about alcohol? In comparison, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention
[[report](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2e4ddc&url=http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/alcohol.htm){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="cdc.gov"}]{.qlink_container} that, as of 2010, over 15,000
people die from alcoholic liver disease in our country every year. The
number for "alcohol-induced deaths, excluding accidents and homicides"
is over 25,000. Why are we arguing so passionately for gun control but
ignoring alcohol? Let's also consider that probably half of the gun
deaths on that chart probably involved alcohol as a motivating (or
exacerbating) factor. So these columns are not mutually exclusive. How
many other preventable deaths has alcohol contributed to? How many drunk
drivers? How many evenings of unprotected sex leading to STIs? How much
drunken drug use?

The only thing I can think of is that "I like alcohol but I don't like
guns."

If you're going to ban an item, why wouldn't you ban the item that is
demonstrably more dangerous, and NOT a Constitutional right? Besides, at
least my gun can protect me from a criminal. Your beer can't do that.

The logic simply does not follow.
