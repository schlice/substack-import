**Content:** [Detaining anyone against their will is illegal (unless
they are a minor and you are their custodial adult). You can be charged
with anything from unlawful detention to (if you relocated them)
kidnapping.\
\
The **only** way you could detain a person is to effect a ***citizen\'s
arrest***. The laws vary widely from state to state on citizen\'s
arrest. The amount of force you can use, when you can use that force,
and what is required of you in order to effect the arrest are all
matters of law, and each state\'s laws are different. If you do
something which violates the state law on citizen\'s arrest, you could
be held legally liable for that.\
