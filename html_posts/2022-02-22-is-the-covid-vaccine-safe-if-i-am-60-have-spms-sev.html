The correct answer is **talk to your neurologist.**

Before you get the COVID vaccine, check with your neurologist, as he or
she may want you to modify your MS therapy drug regimen to allow the
vaccine to work properly.

But to clarify a point you made, your reaction to the flu shot was
unrelated to your MS. It may have been related to the drugs you were
taking at the time, but MS does not cause allergic reactions.

The only considerations you have to make now are your risk of exposure
to COVID, your risk if you contract COVID, and your other drugs,
especially your MS therapy drug(s).

But you need to make that decision ***with your neurologist and/or your
care team.*** Make sure you discuss the COVID vaccine you wish to get,
and whether or not you need to modify your MS therapy drugs before you
take it, and to weigh your risks and benefits.

Your healthcare is unique to *you*. Don't let anyone tell you that
you're stupid if you don't get the vaccine, or that you must get it to
make society better. That's just irrational and groupthink-y. You make
the decision that is best for you and your health, with your doctor's
assistance.
