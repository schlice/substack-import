**Will we get to see Trump take the stand in the rape defamation case
filed by E. Jean Carroll?**

Even if the case is allowed to proceed, and assuming that Trump is still
president at the time the case goes to trial, you will not see the
president walk in to a courtroom to testify.

At best, Trump may provide a video recording of a deposition made
somewhere in the White House to accommodate his busy schedule.

Here's the facts. No sitting president has ever testified in open court.
President James Monroe responded to written questions as a witness in a
military trial in the early 1800s. President Gerald R. Ford gave a
deposition in 1975 in the criminal trial of the woman who aimed a gun at
him in San Francisco. President Bill Clinton gave two separate
videotaped depositions in criminal cases, but most notably, he gave a
four-hour videotaped statement in the Paula Jones lawsuit, which became
the first time a sitting president ever gave testimony in a civil case
in which he was a defendant.

If the case is allowed to proceed to trial, Trump will likely be held to
the Clinton standard and be forced to provide a video recording of a
deposition which will likely take place at the White House.
