It depends on your neighborhood.

For the sake of discussion, I'll also assume we're talking about an HOA
consisting of single-family homes, not a condo.

If you live in a gated community, then your community owns everything
inside the gates, including the roads. Your HOA can boot and tow cars
for violating parking rules.

If you do not live in a gated community, your HOA does not own the
roads. Your local government (city, county, etc) owns the roads. The HOA
cannot boot or tow cars unless they are parked on HOA property (so, for
example, if you have a clubhouse owned by the HOA, cars can be towed
from that parking lot). The only remedy for parking violations in a
non-gated community is fines.

But that becomes a rather expensive proposition, because you first must
prove the car belongs to a resident or a guest of a resident, which
means the HOA has to pay to run the plates. If the car can't be linked
to a resident, then the money to run the plates is wasted. The HOA can
only enforce fines against homeowners, residents and their guests, and
if you can't positively ID the owner of the car as one of those, you
don't know who to fine.

In short, in a non-gated community, parking rules are extremely
difficult to enforce. Your best bet is to contact the local government
if the parked car is in violation of city or county parking laws (i.e.
parked in a No Parking Zone).

Original question:

Can I have my neighbor\'s vehicle towed if they are violating the
neighborhood parking rules and restrictions in my community?
