I think that there are two ways to look at this question: purely
physiologically, and in the context of modern United States society. I
think what you're hinting at with your question is that it's normal to
find an underage teenage girl sexually desirable. "Normalcy," however,
is not determined purely by physiological responses, but must be placed
into context of "normal" society. Normal society places age restrictions
on mating because below a specific age, it is generally recognized that
the decision-making centers in the brain are not mature enough to fully
understand a subject as fraught with nuance and potential circumstances
such as intercourse. Therefore, trying to "divest" the two and say that
it's perfectly "normal" to feel that an underage woman is sexually
desirable is not a valid question, since normalcy is determined by
societal norms, not just pure physiology.

So let's go back to the beginning of my answer and do exactly what I was
just saying you can't do: separate the physiological response, and the
societal norms of modern society. To address the question from the
purely physiological standpoint, attraction is a physiological function
which draws us to mate with women who can produce children. Visually, we
are drawn to fully-formed proportionally-correct females so that we can
ensure when we mate, we have the highest chance of producing a baby:
full hips, fully-formed breasts, normal adult height, normal adult
physique, normal adult weight, etc. When a woman meets those criteria,
she is more-than-likely able to create children. In fact, these days,
women are more likely to be able to create children ***before*** they
reach full adult physiological maturity, but the maturity creates the
attraction to ensure that when the physical maturity is present, the
woman is able to reproduce.

Now, we must add the norms of society. We recognized ***long*** ago that
the urge to procreate does not take mental factors into account.
*Physical* maturity does not indicate *mental* maturity. Mental maturity
often follows physical maturity by a number of years. And mental
maturity is variable; one person may be psychologically ready to handle
the responsibility of sexuality and child rearing, while others of that
age are not. Society, therefore, ever concerned with concrete numbers,
set a threshold age at which most people (men and women) should be
sufficiently mature enough to handle adult relationships and child
rearing.

Therefore, as a society, considering we are ***smarter*** than our
Neanderthal ancestors, we recognize our physical urgings for what they
are, and we don't follow our urgings further.
