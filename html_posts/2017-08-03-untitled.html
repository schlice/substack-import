Actually, that's not true. The courts have ruled that an officer may not
detain you longer than it would take to conduct a traffic stop. They
cannot detain you while you wait for a drug dog. And they definitely
cannot detain you while they wait to get a warrant. Anything like this
happening would mean that the search, and anything found during the
search, would be thrown out of court.

Remember, this won't stop the action at the side of the road. It would
only invalidate anything found during the search. That's why you do what
you're told at the scene, and then get a lawyer to help you with the
legal parts.
