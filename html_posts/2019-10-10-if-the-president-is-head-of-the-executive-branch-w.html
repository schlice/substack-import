**If the President is head of the Executive Branch, which includes the
Justice Department, why is the Justice Department arresting people who
work for the President\'s personal lawyer?**

The Department of Justice works for the Executive Branch. However, the
Department of Justice is not Trump's personal attorneys.

If people who work for the President's personal lawyer commit crimes (in
this case, campaign finance related crimes), the Department of Justice
is right to pursue charges against those men. They are alleged to have
set up a fake nonprofit to funnel money to the America First Action
super PAC as well as a \$15,000 donation to a super PAC supporting
Patrick Morrisey, West Virginia's Republican attorney general. It
appears that their illegal activity is unrelated to Giuliani or the
Ukraine investigation.
