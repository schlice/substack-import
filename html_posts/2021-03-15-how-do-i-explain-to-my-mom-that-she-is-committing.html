**How do I explain to my mom that she is committing human rights
violations and violating child labor laws by taking me to Lowes and
making me look at flowers with her?**

*(US Answer Only)*

You don't, because she's not.

Until the day you turn 18, she owns you. Yes, you have agency. Yes, you
are an individual. Yes, your opinion should be respected.

But ultimately, unless she is harming you, she can make you go to Lowe's
and look at flowers.

You are not an indentured servant. You are a *child*.

If you already have a job which allows you to support yourself, you
should ask your parents for emancipation. If not, you're fresh outta
luck.

Maybe try talking with your mom about how you feel instead of posting on
Quora.
