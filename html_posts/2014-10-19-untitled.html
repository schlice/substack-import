<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [Your statement is fundamentally flawed. The religious
ceremony of marriage has existed for thousands of years before any
government or legal entity tried to regulate it.\
\
Why, then, did the government step in and force people in their
localities to get licenses for marriages? Originally, it was because
there were rules criminalizing sex outside of marriage. Remember those?
Yes, ladies and gents, adultery used to be a crime. Why?\
\
In actuality, it\'s the same reason we still have marriage licenses even
though adultery is no longer a crime. The reason is pretty
straightforward: **sex between men and women regularly produces
children.** It\'s a known fact. No other type of sex produces children.\
\
The government, based on whatever reasoning they use, still believes
that children growing up in intact families consisting of the parents
that made them will have the best (not the only, just the best) chance
for succeeding in adulthood. They use studies of criminals, studies of
kids in and out of the foster system, etc, and they find that these kids
don\'t do as well in life as kids from households which contain their
biological mother and father.\
\
So the government used to license those people to make lives together so
that they can have kids. Those licenses came with incentives, like tax
breaks, that you couldn\'t get anywhere else. This is what the
government does: they give tax breaks when you do things they like, and
they raise your taxes when you do things they don\'t like. That\'s the
best means they have to control you: through your wallet/purse.\
\
Do you have to have kids in order for a marriage to be valid? No, a
marriage is not a \"requirement\" to have kids. It\'s simply a means of
dealing with kids when and if they come along.\
\
So a \"marriage license\" for a gay couple simply doesn\'t make sense.
That marriage will never bear children, so there is no need for the
contingency for the generativity that such a union would provide. So as
far as the state is concerned, there is no need for such an agreement,
because it doesn\'t make sense.\
\
Gay couples argue that marriage licenses signify an important
recognition of their loving bond. I would agree, this is a good that
comes out of marriage. But understanding the fundamental purpose of
marriage reveals that gay couples are asking for a symbolic right that
currently has no basis in the reality that it was originally supposed to
espouse.\
\
So should we change marriage? Does the traditional understanding of
marriage have so little to be said for it that it needs to be changed?\
\
I think that if the state wants to provide benefits to families who are
parents of children (natural, adopted, or otherwise), they should tie
the benefits to the children, not to the marriage. In this way, churches
can marry whomever they want to (many churches offer marriage to gay and
lesbian couples), and the state can still provide benefits to parents
who raise children. The deciding factor should be the children, and the
benefits should follow the adoption/birth of those children. You
shouldn\'t get a benefit just for being married. If the state wants to
provide benefits, provide them to any couple who has kids. Then remove
the marriage licensing requirements and let the churches handle
marriage.]{.rendered_qtext}
