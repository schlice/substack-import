<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [Your statement is fundamentally flawed. The religious<br>ceremony of marriage has existed for thousands of years before any<br>government or legal entity tried to regulate it.\<br>\<br>Why, then, did the government step in and force people in their<br>localities to get licenses for marriages? Originally, it was because<br>there were rules criminalizing sex outside of marriage. Remember those?<br>Yes, ladies and gents, adultery used to be a crime. Why?\<br>\<br>In actuality, it\'s the same reason we still have marriage licenses even<br>though adultery is no longer a crime. The reason is pretty<br>straightforward: **sex between men and women regularly produces<br>children.** It\'s a known fact. No other type of sex produces children.\<br>\<br>The government, based on whatever reasoning they use, still believes<br>that children growing up in intact families consisting of the parents<br>that made them will have the best (not the only, just the best) chance<br>for succeeding in adulthood. They use studies of criminals, studies of<br>kids in and out of the foster system, etc, and they find that these kids<br>don\'t do as well in life as kids from households which contain their<br>biological mother and father.\<br>\<br>So the government used to license those people to make lives together so<br>that they can have kids. Those licenses came with incentives, like tax<br>breaks, that you couldn\'t get anywhere else. This is what the<br>government does: they give tax breaks when you do things they like, and<br>they raise your taxes when you do things they don\'t like. That\'s the<br>best means they have to control you: through your wallet/purse.\<br>\<br>Do you have to have kids in order for a marriage to be valid? No, a<br>marriage is not a \"requirement\" to have kids. It\'s simply a means of<br>dealing with kids when and if they come along.\<br>\<br>So a \"marriage license\" for a gay couple simply doesn\'t make sense.<br>That marriage will never bear children, so there is no need for the<br>contingency for the generativity that such a union would provide. So as<br>far as the state is concerned, there is no need for such an agreement,<br>because it doesn\'t make sense.\<br>\<br>Gay couples argue that marriage licenses signify an important<br>recognition of their loving bond. I would agree, this is a good that<br>comes out of marriage. But understanding the fundamental purpose of<br>marriage reveals that gay couples are asking for a symbolic right that<br>currently has no basis in the reality that it was originally supposed to<br>espouse.\<br>\<br>So should we change marriage? Does the traditional understanding of<br>marriage have so little to be said for it that it needs to be changed?\<br>\<br>I think that if the state wants to provide benefits to families who are<br>parents of children (natural, adopted, or otherwise), they should tie<br>the benefits to the children, not to the marriage. In this way, churches<br>can marry whomever they want to (many churches offer marriage to gay and<br>lesbian couples), and the state can still provide benefits to parents<br>who raise children. The deciding factor should be the children, and the<br>benefits should follow the adoption/birth of those children. You<br>shouldn\'t get a benefit just for being married. If the state wants to<br>provide benefits, provide them to any couple who has kids. Then remove<br>the marriage licensing requirements and let the churches handle<br>marriage.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Why-are-gay-people-asking-for-the-right-to-marry-If-it-is-legal-stuff-they-are-asking-for-cant-they-go-to-some-separate-setup-for-partners/answer/Eric-Mour<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
