What they really mean when they say "mandatory evacuations" is that
**services will not be available during the evacuation period.**

If you call the police, they will not come. If you call the fire
department, they will not come. If you call for an ambulance, you're not
getting one.

Officials declare a mandatory evacuation when they cannot safely provide
essential services in the evacuation zone. They want you to move to a
place where they can provide you with essential services.

So do you have to leave during a mandatory evacuation? Can you be
arrested if you stay? No. You can choose to "ride it out" if you want.
**But the point is that if you do, you're on your own.**
