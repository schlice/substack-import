It's true that the Old English style of the KJV is a bit...foreign to us
today. But that's not the real problem I have with the KJV. And I'll get
to that objection in a moment. To me, that's a secondary issue.

The main problem I have with the KJV is that *the choice of words
changes the meaning of some Bible verses.*

For example, **only** the KJV translates the 6th Commandment as "Thou
shalt not kill." Every other modern translation (including the New King
James Version) correctly translates *rasach* as "murder," not "kill."

From gotquestions.org:

That error alone has caused a massive amount of confusion among
Christians. It has caused confusion about whether to serve in the
military during war time, to use deadly force as a police officer, or
even to protect their own families from attackers who wish to *actually
murder them*. And all from one overly broad choice of word which was
actually inconsistently translated, even within the KJV itself.

Additionally, the KJV correctly used the Masoretic Texts as the source
for the Old Testament, but then included the Apocrypha from the
Septuagint. The Masoretic Texts specifically left the Apocrypha out
because they were never written in Hebrew, meaning they were additions
to the Jewish Holy Scriptures. Their omission from the Masoretic Texts
was a *feature,* not a *defect.*

In some cases, KJV includes whole verses which are not found anywhere
else. An example of this is what is referred to as the \"Comma
Johanneum\" in 1 John 5:7, which in the KJV reads, "For there are three
that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost:
and these three are one." The earliest and best manuscripts read, "There
are three that testify." Those three are then identified in the next
verse as the Spirit, the water and the blood. The verse has nothing to
do with the Trinity, but the King James Version added a complete and
unique thought to Scripture. Not only are we not supposed to take away
from the Bible; we shouldn't add to it either.

And then there's the most glaring issue of the Old English. The English
language has changed quite a lot over the last 400 years, so there
shouldn't be a real reason why we *need* to read the Bible in Old
English. This changing over the years means that some words, as they
were translated in Old English, actually convey a different meaning
today. For example, in Matthew 19:14, the KJV reads, "Suffer the little
children to come to me." No one wants little children to suffer. It
should be translated "Allow the little children to come to me." But the
archaic language of the Old English leads to confusion, such as where
the KJV uses the word "conversation" when it actually means "conduct" or
"lifestyle." There have been good faith efforts to correct these issues,
and the New King James Version (NKJV) tries to do this. It's actually an
excellent translation.

But there is one group of people who believe that there is only **one**
translation of the Bible which anyone should be reading, and that's the
KJV. These people are part of the "KJV-Only" movement. They say things
like, "All modern translations have taken verses out of the Bible. The
KJV is the only one that preserves all the Scripture. The KJV is the
only true Bible. Don't use any other." Besides the NKJV, other attempts
(such as the KJ21 and MEV) have been made to make minimal updates to the
KJV, only \"modernizing\" the archaic language, while using the exact
same Greek and Hebrew manuscripts. These attempts are also rejected by
KJV-Only activists. This proves that KJV-Only activists are loyal to the
King James Version itself, not necessarily to the original manuscripts.

If we're going to be loyal to any writing, it should be to the original
manuscripts of the Old and New Testaments, written in Hebrew, Aramaic,
and Greek. Only the original languages are the Word of God as He
inspired it. A translation is only an attempt to take what is said in
one language and communicate it in another. As we all know, language
translation is imprecise, because of structural differences in language
(I detail this [[in another
answer](https://www.quora.com/Is-there-an-original-version-of-the-Holy-Bible-that-has-not-been-altered-by-any-church-If-so-which-version-is-it-and-where-can-it-be-obtained/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container}
about Bible translation philosophies). Loyalty to any text outside of
the original manuscripts is textually fraught.

Here's the bottom line, in my opinion. Modern translations are based on
the earliest and best manuscripts of the Bible and use understandable
contemporary language. Most importantly, they do not add to the Bible.
The King James Version uses archaic English (which causes confusion),
uses overly broad words in some cases (which also causes confusion) and
occasionally adds entirely new thoughts to the text of the Bible. But
still, if you like the KJV, feel free to keep reading it, but just keep
those particular caveats in mind. Just don't hang on the idea that it is
the **only** translation anyone should be reading.

To be honest, I'm just glad that people are reading the Bible. I am far
less concerned with *what* version they read.ยน

version was translated by the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, and is
the first intentional, systematic effort at producing a complete version
of the Bible that is edited and revised for the specific purpose of
agreeing with a religious group's specific doctrine. The Jehovah's
Witnesses and the Watchtower Society realized that their beliefs
contradicted the Bible. So, rather than conforming their beliefs to the
Bible, they altered the Bible to agree with their beliefs.
