**Content:** [Follow all of the basic rules for dealing with police
officers in general. These rules will also protect you against the
corrupt cops.\
]{.rendered_qtext}

- Start by following the law. If an officer, corrupt or not, has no
  reason to make contact with you, he won\'t waste his time.
- If you do get stopped, comply with all directives of the police at the
  scene. Note that I said \"directives,\" not \"requests.\" Unless an
  officer has probable cause or a search warrant, he can\'t search your
  car. That would be a request. \"*Will you consent to a search of your
  car?*\" That\'s a request. The correct answer is \"*Not without
  probable cause or a warrant.*\" \"Will you consent\" means \"will you
  give up your right to privacy voluntarily\". \"*Move over to the curb
  and give me your driver\'s license*\" is a directive. If you were the
  driver, you\'re required to have a license. Give it to him.
- Do not argue at the scene. Save your arguments for later. As many of
  us have said on Quora for a very long time, you have many avenues for
  redress of your complaints. NONE of those avenues take place at the
  scene. Arguing with the officer at the scene, even if you are right,
  will probably just cause more headache for you in the long run.\
- Do not answer questions without a lawyer.
- If you are not arrested and you are free to leave, write down
  everything that happened, to the best of your ability.
