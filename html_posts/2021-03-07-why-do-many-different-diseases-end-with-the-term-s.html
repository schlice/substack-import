**Why do many different diseases end with the term sclerosis?**

Because many different diseases produce "scars," otherwise known as
*scleroses*. Thus, **multiple sclerosis** means "many scars."

In MS, when the myelin sheath is destroyed by the immune system, it is
replaced with a plaque made of cholesterol, primarily. These areas of
*demyelination* cause nerve signals to be attenuated, so they don't
travel at the same pulse frequency, causing the muscle response on the
distant end to be a different intensity than when it was launched from
the brain. This causes the various symptoms of MS.

Another disease which ends in "sclerosis" is ALS, or amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease). In this disease, a very
similar disease process occurs, but instead of in the Central Nervous
System, motor neurons are attacked, and scars are produced. The
difference in ALS is that eventually, the motor neurons affected will
die, and the person with ALS will eventually be unable to move that
muscle.

When a disease process produces a "scar," the disease may be referred to
with the term "sclerosis."
