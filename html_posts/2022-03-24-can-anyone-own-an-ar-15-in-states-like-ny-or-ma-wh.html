You've already heard that there are no special exemptions for former
military members when it comes to state laws regarding firearms
ownership.

NY and MA have some of the strictest firearms laws of any of the states.
While you *can* own an AR-15 in those places, there are indeed state
laws which limit your ability to own certain cosmetic features on the
firearm, and there are many, many hoops to jump through in order to be
able to legally acquire, store, transport, and use these firearms in
those states.

None of us are going to even attempt to list the applicable laws
(although
[[Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=091c70&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_laws_in_the_United_States_by_state){.external_link

You should always check with a gun shop in your local area or a law
enforcement officer to find out what the current laws are regarding any
particular weapon you wish to purchase where you live.
