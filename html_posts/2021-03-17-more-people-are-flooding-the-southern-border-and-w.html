**More people are flooding the southern border and watch list terrorists
are coming across. How is this Biden\'s fault?**

Biden campaigned on loosening immigration controls. He also indicated
that he would halt construction of the border wall, would end Trump's
policy of "wait in Mexico" for asylum, and would halt all deportations.
Since he has been elected, he offered an immigration bill that would
give them a path to citizenship, which has only exacerbated the problem.

Predictably, this signaled to many migrants that it would be easier to
get in to the United States if he were elected, and they would be less
likely to be deported and would be more likely to be able to stay
permanently now that he has been.

Doing this **without addressing the need for increased security at the
border** has, again predictably, led to a border crisis. Yes, many
voters wanted a better approach than what Trump offered. But trying to
placate his base while ignoring the need for more enforcement, without a
solid plan for the (predictable) increase in migrant activity at the
border has only made this problem worse. More migrants are now
attempting riskier desert crossings, placing more people at risk.

Surges in immigration tend to be coupled with hope. Biden gave hope of a
kinder, gentler immigration process, without addressing what to do when
the surge actually took place.

**TL;DR: The current crisis at the border is 100% caused by Biden's
campaigning promises and subsequent policy initiatives.**
