**What happens if I call tech support and speak a foreign language?**

Generally, the auto attendant you reach before you talk to a person asks
if you want to speak using any of the languages that Tech Support is
able to speak in at that time. I'm sure you've heard it:

*For English, press one. Para continuar in Espa√±ol, oprima ocho.*

You're placed into the correct queue based on your choice.

If you want to use a language besides the supported phone languages, you
can choose to use our award-winning eSupport services, including online
chat and email.
