<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [You would be looking for a good property rights attorney<br>who also has experience with local governments.\<br>\<br>However, getting together with your other neighbors to petition the<br>government to take action before taking legal action is probably a great<br>idea. There really is no need to pursue a legal channel until the city<br>makes it necessary. However, I would recommend you get together with<br>your homeowners and an attorney to discuss your rights should the<br>situation come down to a class-action lawsuit.\<br>\<br>I think you should approach your neighbors and lay out a strategy. You<br>need to write a certified letter to the city and tell them that you have<br>a valid legal claim based on tort trespass, and their inaction is<br>precipitating the trespass. You would like them to take action to<br>prevent damage to your respective properties because if it does, you<br>will be forced as a group to begin legal action. Then have all the<br>affected homeowners sign it.\<br>\<br>Believe me, homeowners are far more powerful as a group than they are as<br>individuals. As an individual, you\'re \"that crazy lady next to the<br>ditch.\" But as a group, you\'re trouble for them and they better jump<br>on it before it gets out of hand. I have actually been a party to, and<br>wrote up, such an action, which all my neighbors signed and we sent to<br>the respective city and private organizations. They do respond, and<br>quickly, when they get a letter with that many signatures on it. You<br>also get to see the quality of the organizations you petition based on<br>the quality of the response.\<br>\<br>Because the media will certainly take notice of a group of homeowners as<br>well, you can also try the local news media if the city doesn\'t get off<br>of their collective arses and get going. Your TV station\'s \"call for<br>action\" team is always looking for good stories to follow up on, and<br>this one is a slam dunk, a drop in the bucket, shooting fish in a<br>barrel.\<br>\<br>Good luck to you!]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Can-residents-sue-the-city-they-live-in-because-they-have-not-installed-a-proper-stormwater-runoff-canal-directly-adjacent-to-their-property-and-it-is-now-or-will-be-causing-foundation-issues-in-the-future/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
