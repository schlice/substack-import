**Content:** [You would be looking for a good property rights attorney
who also has experience with local governments.\
\
However, getting together with your other neighbors to petition the
government to take action before taking legal action is probably a great
idea. There really is no need to pursue a legal channel until the city
makes it necessary. However, I would recommend you get together with
your homeowners and an attorney to discuss your rights should the
situation come down to a class-action lawsuit.\
\
I think you should approach your neighbors and lay out a strategy. You
need to write a certified letter to the city and tell them that you have
a valid legal claim based on tort trespass, and their inaction is
precipitating the trespass. You would like them to take action to
prevent damage to your respective properties because if it does, you
will be forced as a group to begin legal action. Then have all the
affected homeowners sign it.\
\
Believe me, homeowners are far more powerful as a group than they are as
individuals. As an individual, you\'re \"that crazy lady next to the
ditch.\" But as a group, you\'re trouble for them and they better jump
on it before it gets out of hand. I have actually been a party to, and
wrote up, such an action, which all my neighbors signed and we sent to
the respective city and private organizations. They do respond, and
quickly, when they get a letter with that many signatures on it. You
also get to see the quality of the organizations you petition based on
the quality of the response.\
\
Because the media will certainly take notice of a group of homeowners as
well, you can also try the local news media if the city doesn\'t get off
of their collective arses and get going. Your TV station\'s \"call for
action\" team is always looking for good stories to follow up on, and
this one is a slam dunk, a drop in the bucket, shooting fish in a
barrel.\
\
Good luck to you!]{.rendered_qtext}
