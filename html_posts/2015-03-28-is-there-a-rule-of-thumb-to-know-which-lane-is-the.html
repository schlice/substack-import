**Content:** [There is no law that distinguishes unmarked lanes. For
example, when you\'re at a traffic light on a 4-lane road (two straight
lanes in both directions and no road markings), you can go straight from
either lane.\

In this street view, it\'s clear that the left lane is a turn lane. But
the next two lanes (the one that says Lexington Dr and the right lane)
can both go straight across. Legally, you can go straight from either
lane. However, I tend to move left (into the lane that says Lexington
Dr) if I\'m going to go straight. I do this because I know that people
can turn right from the right lane, and I don\'t like to impede them. I
know I don\'t like to be impeded from turning right on red, even though
I know it\'s not an exclusive turn lane. However, I DO know that I
can\'t go anywhere but straight in the left lane (not the turn lane) at
the red light, so I move left. I\'m not impeding any traffic at the red
light because you can\'t go anywhere from that lane on red. The same
would hold true if there was no turn lane there; you can\'t go anywhere
on red, where you can turn right from the right lane on red.\
\
So in that situation, if I\'m going straight, I do move left, but it\'s
out of courtesy, not legal obligation.
