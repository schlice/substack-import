Excellent question! And this question points to the one big elephant in
the room:

***If God didn't want man to be tempted, why create such a tree in the
first place?***

Why did the tree exist at all?

The answer is really unrelated to the tree, or its name, or its fruit,
or what benefits it *could* provide to Adam or Eve, because we are
actually unsure about those specifics. We do know that once they ate of
the fruit, they realized they were naked. This is an indication that the
human condition changed, when sin entered the world. Man now had the
ability to know *shame*.

But the details about what happened when they ate the fruit are mostly
unimportant, except for the one where they realized that they were naked
(we'll get there in a bit). In order to really answer the question of
why the tree existed at all, we have to step back and look at the big
picture. And that answer is something we've talked about a lot in this
Space, and it's a really confusing but still important concept: ***free
will.***

And it boils down to this: **if we are to truly have free will, we must
be able to choose evil.**

If we are told that we have free will, but there is no evil to choose,
do we really have free will? Remember that God is a god of love. He *is*
love. God created man with free will because He wants man to choose Him
freely, for love can only be freely given and freely chosen, it can
never be coerced. So God can never demand love, He can only woo.

To that end, if we are to be truly free, ***we must be able to choose
something over God.*** And that choice must be compelling enough that it
could stand up to whatever God was offering. Appealing to the selfish
side of man, appealing to man's frailty and ego, the serpent was able to
tempt man into committing the first sin and choosing something over God.
Ultimately, this was the sin which caused God to have to send Jesus to
redeem us.

So remember when we were talking about Adam and Eve realizing that they
were naked? This is where it becomes exceedingly important. Because
after they sinned, God shed the first innocent blood to cover their sins
in the Garden, when He killed an animal to make clothes to cover their
nakedness. The significance of that action should not be lost on us:
*God shed innocent blood to cover man's sin.* Man had to continue to
offer blood sacrifices and burnt offerings to God to cover their sin,
*as a foreshadowing to the shed blood of the sinless Christ*.
Essentially, their offerings in obedience to God were a "prepayment," if
you will, kinda like putting your expenses on a credit card, to be paid
at a later date. When Christ took on the sin of all mankind while He
hung on the cross, God turned away from Him, as God cannot even gaze
upon sin. It was then that Christ, hearkening back to Psalm 22, called
out, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" The mystery of the
actual workings of that separation are too deep for the human mind to
comprehend, but we've been given the basics. Jesus became sin to be the
*propitiation* for our sin. His shed blood washes us clean. He died
once, for all.

Original question:

Doesn't "God not wanting his human creations to eat the fruit from the
tree of the knowledge of good & evil" show that "'humans getting
knowledge of everything' even if they'll eventually get to directly
request it from God" isn't part of God's plan?
