***Answer which reflects the tenor of the question:***

They do. In a recent survey (highly controversial, since Galapagos crabs
felt very underrepresented), nearly 80% of crabs thought humans walked
sideways. Around 15% of crabs thought they walked sideways, and around
5% of crabs didn\'t really care to answer.

***Answer required to make this answer not a \"joke\" answer:***

Crabs do not \"think.\" They have a brain the size of a peanut. They
cannot form rational thoughts about their environment. They do not
possess higher-order thinking, and therefore do not have the mental
capacity to form opinions about their environment.
