No one has priority. First off, most agencies say that you can\'t just
blow through an intersection at full speed; you must slow down to check
for traffic which may not have noticed the big flashing lights or heard
the siren. So they both should have stopped and worked it out like big
boys and girls. That\'s what grown ups do.
