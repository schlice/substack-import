So let's look at "current trajectory."

Since this question was posted in the "Christians and Christianity"
Space, it's fair to look at Christianity. Therefore, "current
trajectory" is *increasing* worldwide. In 2023, the Christian population
was estimated to be around 2.604 billion, a 44.5 million increase from
mid-2022. By 2024, the Christian population is expected to grow to 2.63
billion. And by 2050, the Christian population is projected to reach 3
billion or more.

So given current trajectory, the concept of organized religion will
never disappear.
