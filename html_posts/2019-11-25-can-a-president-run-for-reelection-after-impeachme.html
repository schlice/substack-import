**Can a president run for reelection after impeachment?**

After *impeachment from the House*, yes.

After *removal from office by the Senate*, maybe.

The Senate trial will consist of several votes. They will vote primarily
on whether or not the person impeached should be removed from office.

If the Senate votes to remove the impeached person from office, they
will *then* vote on whether or not the impeached person will be
disqualified from holding Federal elected office in the future.

If the person is disqualified from holding office in the future,
***then*** they will not be able to be re-elected.

Unless all of that happens, then yes, an impeached (and even possibly
removed from office) president can run for re-election, and can be
re-elected.
