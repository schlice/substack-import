*The military mindset is starting to conflict with my Libertarian
worldview.*

There is nothing wrong with this! Patton said, "If everyone is thinking
alike, then someone isn't thinking." We ***need*** differing opinions on
everything (when presented correctly and respectfully, of course). I
always told my enlisted troops that my door was always open. That meant
that if they needed to question something, needed to talk about
something, needed advice about something, I was always willing to
listen. If I'm wrong, I'd rather know up front than when senior
leadership is shitting down on me because I screwed the pooch.

*Is it the AF's business how clean I keep my room?*

Assuming you live in the dorms, it is absolutely the Air Force's
business how clean you keep your room. Keeping a clean room means that
you do not attract vermin which can affect the quality of life and
sanitary living conditions of your space, and your neighbor's spaces as
well. Additionally, you are a tenant in your room, you do not own it.
The property manager (i.e. the Air Force) has every right to ensure you
are providing basic upkeep so that he does not have to endure costly
repairs when you leave. Additionally, since you did actually "sign up
for it," the Air Force can do MWH (Morale, Welfare, and Health)
inspections to ensure you are mentally okay. This is more than what
might happen in an off-base apartment, but you're living in the dorms,
so "their house, their rules."

*Who cares if I'm a shut-in?*

The aforementioned MWH inspections ensure that your mental health is
stable. Being a shut-in may simply be your nature, or it may be the
early signs of depression, perhaps caused by PTSD, and you may be headed
down a bad path which can be corrected with early intervention. It may
be nothing, or it may be something. Expect the Air Force to follow up to
ensure it is nothing.

*Why can't I question authority when Science tells me to question
everything?*

As I previously mentioned, in general your commanders want you to
question almost everything. **There is always an appropriate time and
place for appropriate questions**. Every good commander knows this. And
dare I say, if your commander tells you they accept no questions, then
my previous sentence stands, and I would challenge any commander who
accepted no feedback. However, remember there is an ***appropriate***
time and place for appropriate questions. On the battlefield, when lives
are on the line, is not the time to be questioning orders. Unless you
**know** that an order is illegal, your only question should be to
request an altitude vector when your commander tells you to engage in
vertical ascent (in other words, when I say "jump", you say "how high").
Now later on, pull me aside and say, "Captain, can I have a word in
private?" and then we discuss what your concerns are. And since I am one
of the aforementioned "good" commanders, I will listen thoughtfully to
your concerns. I've had folks question me on all sorts of things, an
usually explaining things to them helped. I could explain things when I
had the opportunity to do so. I did not always have that opportunity. In
those cases, I appreciate when my orders are followed without question.
Remember the old saying, "Ours is not to question why, ours is just to
do or die." It also reminds me of the poem, "The Train":

> It's not my place to drive the train,\
> The whistle I can't blow.\
> It's not my place to say how far\
> The train's supposed to go.
>
> It's not my place to shoot off steam,\
> Or even clang the bell.\
> But let the damn thing jump the track,\
> And see who catches hell.

*And saying that, "I signed up for this," doesn't answer the question.*

In most cases in the military, it does. Like I said, every **good**
commander knows that they have to accept feedback in order to grow.
Emphasis is on "good." Not all commanders are good. I know, I've worked
for plenty of less-than-good commanders. I've also worked with some
amazing, stellar commanders who I'd follow to the gates of Hell if I was
asked.

That said, if I was your commander, I would expect you to ask for a
conference where I could address your concerns. ***You must be prepared
to be told no.*** Will you be satisfied if you are merely heard? Or must
your changes be implemented? This is up to you to decide, and you will
have to decide how you will proceed beyond that. Remember, you have a
term of enlistment. You are under no obligation to sign up for an
additional term of enlistment once your current one is complete.
