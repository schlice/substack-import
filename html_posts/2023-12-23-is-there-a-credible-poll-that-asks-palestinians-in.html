Since it would be virtually impossible to find a reputable pollster to
conduct such a poll, you should look at history.

The first opportunity that the people in the new Palestine region had to
elect a government, and they chose Hamas as their leaders.

Think about that. The supposedly innocent, peace-loving people of
Gaza...***chose*...Hamas**.

When given a choice, they chose the openly terrorist organization to be
their leaders.

What does **that** tell you?
