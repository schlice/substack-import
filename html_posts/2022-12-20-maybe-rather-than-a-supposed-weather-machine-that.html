First, there is no sane person who believes that Democrats have a
weather machine that keeps the evil minorities from voting. Sheesh, get
a grip.

Second, God isn't angry at us for sinning. He's sad, but He knows we are
***ALL*** sinners, and that means me, *and you too*. Yes, you reading
this answer, you're a sinner, too. We have ***ALL*** fallen short of
God's glory. None of us deserve God's grace. Every one of us deserves
nothing less than to be cast into Hell.

But the two greatest words in the Bible: ***BUT GOD***

We deserve nothing less than Hell. ***BUT GOD*** showed us grace when we
deserved damnation.

God doesn't cause bad weather when we vote Republican, just as He
doesn't cause bad weather when we vote Democrat, or Independent, or any
other way conceivable. Voting is our civic duty.

> God couldn\'t possibly like such hateful people that republicans are?

God loves you *despite* the hate in your heart. Know that. But God wants
you to be *better*. God wants you to ask Him for forgiveness and for you
to live *better*.

And as difficult as it may be to believe, there are hateful people of
*every* political affiliation, even no political affiliation at all.
Simply being a Republican doesn't make you hateful. Ultimately, God
doesn't care who you vote for. God cares *why* you voted the way you
did. God cares that you have repented of your own sins and accepted
Christ as your savior.

Voting is not a sinful act. Voting is actually fulfilling God's command
for us to submit ourselves to the government that He put in place, since
all of our government leaders are still subservient to His authority. No
one ascends to power who wasn't placed there by God. God allows all this
to happen in accordance with His plans.

Voting doesn't make you sinful. Having sinful thoughts and doing sinful
things makes you sinful. Can you vote sinfully? Sure, if your goal is to
use your vote for sinful purposes. But I'm pretty sure that everyone who
votes believes that the people they vote for will do the best job they
can in the best way they think it can be done.
