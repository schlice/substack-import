**What are some possible causes for rapid muscle wasting?**

The main reason for muscle wasting is lack of physical activity.
Sometimes an injury or a disease makes it difficult or impossible to
move a muscle, and the muscle begins to shrink.

> - dermatomyositis, causes muscle weakness and skin rash
> - Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome, an autoimmune disease that leads to nerve
>   inflammation and muscle weakness
> - multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease in which the body destroys
>   the protective coverings of nerves
> - muscular dystrophy, an inherited disease that causes muscle weakness
> - neuropathy, damage to a nerve or nerve group, resulting in loss of
>   sensation or function
> - osteoarthritis, causes reduced motion in the joints
> - polio, a viral disease affecting muscle tissue that can lead to

> - polymyositis, an inflammatory disease
> - rheumatoid arthritis, a chronic inflammatory disease that affects
>   the joints
> - spinal muscular atrophy, a hereditary disease causing arm and leg
