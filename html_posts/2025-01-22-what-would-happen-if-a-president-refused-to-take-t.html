If the President-elect fails to take the oath of office, then he does
not become President. Section 3 of the 20th Amendment says that the Vice
President, who took the oath just before the President-elect, would
serve as the President, and he would appoint a Vice President.

In theory, the President-elect should be able to **later** take the oath
and assume the office of the President to which he was elected, but this
is untested territory.
