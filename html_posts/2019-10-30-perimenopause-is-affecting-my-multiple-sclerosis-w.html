**Perimenopause is affecting my multiple sclerosis. Would a hysterectomy
be beneficial?**

Unlikely.

Menopause interacts with MS by way of estrogen, or the lack thereof.
Estrogen depletion can cause MS symptoms to worsen. Indeed, during the
pregnancy years, when estrogen flourishes (especially during active
pregnancy), MS symptoms subside, and then worsen again after the baby is
born. The link between estrogen and MS is well documented.

The loss of estrogen is the key driver in MS worsening after menopause.

A hysterectomy would not change your level of estrogen. Hormone
replacement therapy, on the other hand, might.

You should talk to your gynecologist about adding HRT to your health
regimen. You might just find that your MS symptoms improve as
well.[\[1\]](#hzBng){#cite-hzBng .citation_link}
