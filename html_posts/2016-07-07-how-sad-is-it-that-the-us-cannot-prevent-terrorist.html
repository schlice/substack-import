It's not illegal to *be* a terrorist. It's illegal to *do terrorist
things.* This dichotomy is what often trips people up in terms of their
logical thinking. I can be a terrorist sympathizer and I haven't broken
any laws. I can *like* terrorists and I can *morally support* their
cause (financing terrorists is actually doing something, which is
illegal). Does that make me a terrorist? More importantly, does it break
any laws? Until we come up with a *Minority Report* machine and thought
crimes, I can support the actions of terrorists without being one. There
is a certain line which must be crossed, and in this country, that line
is actually doing terrorist things, or plotting to do terrorist things.
Supporting terrorists with more than just my good wishes (i.e.
financially) is indeed illegal, but if I'm a rah-rah squad for a
terrorist, I haven't violated any laws.

If you are a terrorist who hasn't ever violated any laws (i.e. you just
think like a terrorist), you can buy a gun.

It's an interesting problem. How do we stop US citizens from exercising
their fundamental rights as citizens because *they believe in a
particular ideology?* Well, you can't. Because that act alone would also
violate their fundamental rights as citizens.

It's a tough balance to strike, but it can be done. For example, if a
person is suspected of being a terrorist, you can ***delay*** the
purchase of a gun and give the government the opportunity to charge the
person in court (thus preserving his rights as a citizen and also
keeping guns out of his hands). If the government chooses not to charge
(or fails to charge), the purchase is allowed to proceed.

(EDIT) In order to make the corollary to dogs, the *owner* would have to
be licensed to own a dog. In most municipalities, the *dogs* are
licensed. And they're not really "licensed," they are simply
"registered" as having received appropriate immunizations. We call it a
"license" but it's really nothing more than registration.
