It depends on what you call a Christian church.

\

**TRIGGER WARNING: Before we begin this discussion, we must agree that
women are equal to men when we discuss value as human beings. The Bible
is also abundantly clear about this point. There is no ambiguity: women
and men have equal value.**

**And we are not discounting the ability of women to succeed in many
areas of life, just as men do. Women are exceedingly capable, and have
proven that over the decades.**

**In other words, it's not me denying a woman because I'm a misogynist.
It's the Bible which lays out the hierarchy which speaks against it.**

In other other words, *don't shoot the messenger.*

\

*That said, there is a* ***hierarchy*** *laid out in the Bible.*

Some Christian denominations denounce the clear teachings of the Bible
which indicate that there is clear, Biblical reasoning against females
being pastors, or in any rulership position. And yes, in those
Bible-denying "Christian" denominations, women can be pastors.

But the Bible itself speaks clearly against it. **Women are not to
exercise headship in the assembly.**

> *Let a woman learn quietly with all submissiveness. I do not permit a
> woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; rather, she is to
> remain quiet. \-- 1 Timothy 2:11--12 ESV*

This is a difficult one to wrap our modern, woman's equality, inclusive
American minds around, so remember that this is a Biblical exegesis,
only applicable to those who believe in, and pattern their lives after,
the truth of the Bible.

Here's the exegetical analysis of 1 Timothy 2:11--12:

> Verse 11 presented what at first appears to be a controversial
> statement. Viewed in full context, however, Paul has simply stated
> that women should not be flagrant or excessively loud or frenzied
> during a church gathering. Just as clothing should reflect a
> controlled, reasonable person, so too should behavior in a church
> service reflect godly peace.
>
> How, then, is this phrase \[in verse 12\] regarding women and teaching

> that with Apollos in Acts 18:26. Phoebe also served in some type of

So again, we see here that the admonition against women leading church
services is not because women cannot lead well, it's because men are
*supposed to* lead well.

People often get hung up on this point about leadership, and for
context, they point back to Genesis at the creation of woman and they
note how God called her a "helper." But it's not exactly as you think.
When God said He was going to create a woman, He said:

> *Then the LORD God said, "It is not good that the man should be alone;
> I will make him a helper fit for him." \-- Genesis 2:18 ESV*

Now, a lot of people get hung up on the English word "helper," because
at least in English, the connotation is *secondary* to the *primary*
person. The "helper" in English is more like the "assistant."

But not so in Hebrew.

The Hebrew word used to describe Eve is *ezer*, which means a
counterpart, someone who completes, someone who strengthens.

That
[[word](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=328874&url=https://biblehub.com/hebrew/strongs_5828.htm){.external_link

times** in the Bible, and ***in every case*** is used to describe how
God relates to us. God is our helper, someone who completes us, someone
who strengthens us.

And God used that word to describe Eve. Does that sound like someone who
is an "assistant"? Would God describe himself as "second place?"

That has *radical* implications, no? The same word God uses to describe
Eve is the same word God uses to describe ***Himself in relation to
us.***

That's the level of importance God ascribes to the woman.

\

So yes, the woman is very important, but is still commanded to not
*lead*. At this point, the smart Christian woman would ask the one
relevant Biblical question:

***But what about Deborah?***

The case of Deborah fits exactly what we were discussing. Deborah's rule
shouldn't have been seen as wrong because Deborah didn't lead well.
Deborah's rule should have been seen as wrong because *men were supposed
to lead, and they did not, to Israel's lasting shame.*

So is bringing up Deborah a fair counterpoint to what we already
addressed as the Biblical patriarchy?
