**What advances have been made in the treatment of Multiple Sclerosis?**

In the realm of advancements in treatment of MS, we made a *massive*
leap in the 90's, and we've made incremental leaps since then.

In the 90's, a class of drugs formerly used to treat cancer patients was
approved to treat MS. That class of drugs is called *interferons*. Two
interferons, interferon-1A and interferon-1B were marketed as Avonex and
Betaseron respectively. This was the first time we had a medication
which could actually slow down the progression of the disease and lessen
its impact. This was *revolutionary* in the treatment of the disease.

But its effects were limited. Interferons only seemed to be effective on
relapsing forms of the disease, and efficacy was not wonderful. Those
with progressive forms of the disease were still out of luck.

We have advanced since then. We now have some medications which are
approved to treat progressive forms of MS. We even have one medication
specifically designed for a symptom of MS (Ampyra is specifically
designed to help MS patients who have difficulty walking), and that's a
first. All of our other treatments for symptoms were originally targeted
at other diseases.

Our medications have advanced beyond interferons. We have synthetic
proteins (Copaxone) and medications which prevent immune cells from
crossing the blood-brain barrier (Tysabri). We have oral medications now
(Tecfidera, Aubagio, Gilenya), rather than just IM or SC injectables.
The newest infusion-based medication (Ocrevus) is administered by
infusion once every six months.
