It's not really that simple though.

Just looking at today's poll numbers, one poll conducted by Research
America of 1000 likely voters in Virginia has the race at a dead heat.
But according to 538, she has a 6 point lead, and according to RCP, she
has a 4.8 point lead. Rasmussen gives her a three point lead.

*So it sounds like what you're saying is that on average, she's leading.
So she's going to win, right?*

Not so fast. Joe Biden won the state by a ***double-digit margin*** just
four years ago. This means that her current performance in Virginia is
*abysmal*. In fact, Biden's double-digit win in Virginia was the best
performance for the Democrats in Virginia since ***1944***. Hillary
Clinton won Virginia by 5.3 points, even considering she ran with Tim
Kaine on her ticket, a representative from Virginia.

And in comparison, in **every state in the country**, she is polling
**way below** where Joe Biden was just four years ago.

The "seven" swing states are Nevada, Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan,
Pennsylvania, Georgia, and North Carolina. But given what I just said
about Virginia, I'd argue that Virginia is also going to be very
competitive. Don't forget that Virginia experienced its own "red wave"
electing Younkin by just under 2 points, and that was the first time
Republicans won a state race since 2009. Before he dropped out of the
running, Biden was *losing* to Trump by 0.4 points average. In a state
where Republicans rarely win, Trump is polling really well.

*Yeah, but she's still leading Virginia by three points.*

Right, but that's no guarantee she's actually going to win in November.
Joe Biden was polling 8 points higher than Trump right up until the
election in Wisconsin, but then ended up winning the state by just **0.6
points.** This is just one illustration of how polling overestimates
Democrats.

Trump was doing much worse in polling in 2016 and 2020, and those
polling numbers were not borne out on election day.

So as for the swing states, Trump is likely to win NC, GA, AZ, and NV.
The former Blue Wall states WI, MI, and PA are currently leaning Trump
in the polls ("lean" states are states which a candidate will win by
between 2 and 6 points). Given that Biden won them by such slim margins
in 2020, and given that Harris is less popular than Biden was, and given
that conditions were ripe for a Democrat to win (recession plus COVID)
and those same conditions are not in play now, it's likely that Trump
will win the former Blue Wall by anywhere from 2 to 6 points.

And that's it, we really don't need to talk about much else, because if
Harris doesn't win the ENTIRE former Blue Wall states, she has no chance
of winning the election. Pennsylvania is the most desired of the Blue
Wall states with its 19 electoral votes, which is why they are both
campaigning so hard there, and are pouring buckets full of money into
campaign ads.

**TL;DR: Some nebulous social media slogan someone made up isn't going
to win multiple hundreds of thousands of voters across all of the swing
states.**
