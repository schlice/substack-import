Flying as a passenger on a military transport is no more or less
dangerous than flying on a commercial airliner from an aircraft safety
point of view, but there are several factors that make military travel
slightly safer in other respects than civilian air travel.

On military transport, when you are not sitting in jump seats, you are
seated backwards. Studies have shown that sitting facing rearward is a
safer position to sit, as it minimizes blunt force traumas which may
occur if the aircraft lurches during landing, or if there is
a...ahem..."sudden deceleration" from an "unscheduled landing." If that
particular unscheduled landing is survivable, you have a better chance
of minimizing injuries by sitting facing rearward. But John Q. Public
likes to ride in their airplanes the same way they ride in the bus or in
the car: facing the front, even though it is demonstrably safer to face
the rear while flying.

Additionally, military airfields are significantly less crowded than
commercial airports, so you are less likely to encounter ground
impingement at a military airfield.

Finally (and not to be terribly underestimated), because the general
public does not ride on military aircraft, there is far less threat of
nefarious or unruly characters on board than on a civilian passenger
plane.
