So you have two totally separate questions here (unless you were trying
to tie the Trinity into Jesus' death and resurrection, but I don't see
it. So I'll take your questions one at a time.

> **Is there even a little, common sense logical connection between
> Jesus\' death and human resurrection?**

Certainly.

If you have to *die* before you can be *resurrected*, Jesus' death,
**followed by His resurrection**, paved the way for us all to be
resurrected. Someone had to be *the first*, right? Jesus was the first.

His death is important, because He had to die before He could be
resurrected. The Bible talks about this in several places, but one I can
think of off the top of my head is in Genesis:

> *Then the Lord God said, "Behold, the man has become like one of us in
> knowing good and evil. Now, lest he reach out his hand and take also
> of the tree of life and eat, and live forever---" therefore the Lord
> God sent him out from the garden of Eden to work the ground from which
> he was taken.*

After Adam and Eve ate from the tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil,
God made this statement. But why wouldn't He want Adam and Eve to eat
from the Tree of Life, and live forever? Because if man becomes
immortal, Jesus wouldn't be able to die. And if Jesus can't die, He
can't be resurrected. Jesus defeated **both sin AND death** by dying on
the cross and being resurrected.

> **Can one be three at the same time?**

This is literally one of the toughest concepts in the Bible to
understand. But just because we can't comprehend it doesn't mean that it
isn't true. Just imagine yourself talking to a pregnant mother's belly:

"Listen baby, it's gonna be so cool when you get here. There's this
stuff called ice cream, you're going to love it. And then there's this
stuff called trees and grass and sunsets and clouds and..."

Can that baby even comprehend what you're saying? No, because at that
time, the baby's brain isn't developed enough to comprehend it. In a
similar way, our brains can't even comprehend the mind of God or what He
has in store for us.

The Trinity is just the same. Yes, God is three unique, individual
persons. Yes, at the same time, He is one God. And it's really difficult
for us to wrap our brains around that fact. That doesn't make it any
less true.
