**Can local sheriff detectives legally go to my neighbors and ask them
if they can use their property to surveil my property because they were
told by my vindictive ex that I was committing crimes?**

The short answer, as my esteemed colleagues have mentioned, is **yes**
they can.

If they are legally permitted (by the owner) to be in a place, and they
can see your property from that place without violating any privacy
laws, then they are absolutely allowed to be there and to watch you.

suggested, if you're truly in this situation, you should hire an
attorney and discuss your options with him/her.
