**Is it true Gen. Kristin Goodwin was removed as Commandant of Cadets at
the USAFA for supporting SRS for trans cadets or just because she was
openly gay herself?**

Neither.

While we don\'t know the exact nature of the charges against her which
led to her removal as Commandant, it is not a violation of UCMJ to have
an opinion. It\'s not even a violation of UCMJ to publicly announce your
opinion.

It may be a policy violation to speak on behalf of the Air Force when
you are not authorized to do so, but that still doesn\'t rise to the
level of a crime.

Since it\'s not illegal to be openly gay, not is it illegal to have an
opinion about SRS, neither qualify as a reason to relieve a decorated
officer from her job.
