Because that's the definition of repentance.

The word \"repent\" comes from the Greek word metanoeō, which means \"to
change one\'s mind.\" Its literal translation combines two Greek words,
"meta" and "noieo" which means to "think differently." From Strong's
Concurrence:

> **Repent**\
> Μετανοήσατε (Metanoēsate)\
> Verb - Aorist Imperative Active - 2nd Person Plural\

In order to repent, you must think differently about sin. It's a literal
turning away from the thoughts of sin.

It is sometimes conflated with another Greek word:

> **turn back**\
> ἐπιστρέψατε (epistrepsate)\
> Verb - Aorist Imperative Active - 2nd Person Plural\
> [[Strong\'s

> ]{.qlink_container}From epi and strepho; to revert.

But that's the word which literally means "to turn back." We can see it
in Acts 3:19, where both Greek words are used together:

> *Repent therefore, and turn back, that your sins may be blotted out,
> \-- Acts 3:19 ESV*
