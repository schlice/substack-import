Your use of the term "statute of limitations" is incorrect. A statute of
limitations limits the amount of time an agency has to charge you with
an offense.

There is no "statute of limitations" on unpaid speeding tickets. There
is a point (again, varies by state) at which if you fail to pay, you can
no longer pay and you are required to go to court. If you fail to go to
court, a bench warrant is issued for your arrest.

In Colorado, the bench warrant is also delivered to the DMV, who sends
you a nastygram telling you you have an Outstanding Judgement Warrant
(OJW) open against you and how to address it. If you fail to do so,
usually within 30 days, your license is automatically suspended.

If you are subsequently stopped, you can be arrested for driving on a
suspended license, have to pay fines, and probably have your license
suspended further (usually an additional year).

Also, license suspensions are communicated between states using the
National Driver Registry, but whether or not the particular department
that stops you has instant access to that data depends on how connected
their systems are. Most large cities and state agencies will have that
information available in-car to the officer when he scans your license.
Smaller jurisdictions may only have that lookup capability with the
dispatcher, or not have instant access to it at all.
