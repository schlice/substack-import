**Are red flag laws constitutional?**

Red Flag laws (or Extreme Risk Protection Orders, ERPOs) probably can
fit within the 4th and 6th Amendments. They may even fit within the 2nd
Amendment (which is dubious, but for now we'll let it slide).

Where ERPOs clearly and unarguably fall is the 5th Amendment.

> ...nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process
> of the law.

So the question becomes: *does the process of the ERPO comport with the
5th Amendment's requirement for due process?*

While there has been much variability over the decades, "due process"
has, pretty universally, involved a hearing in a court where the actual
person whose rights are to be curtailed may present evidence,
cross-examine witnesses, and have an opportunity to be represented by
counsel

...***before the rights are curtailed.***

This is where ERPOs fail Constitutional muster. Because if a person is
dangerous enough to have their 2nd Amendment rights limited, they're
still dangerous enough to have their 2nd Amendment rights limited when
they are in court represented by counsel. And ERPOs remove
Constitutional rights without the accused being present or being
represented by counsel or having any opportunity for due process at all.

And yes, the argument is absolutely true that a dangerous person may win
in court and not have his 2nd Amendment rights curtailed when he
probably should. But remember Blackstone's Ratio: "It is better that ten
guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer." In other words, we
would rather see the man who should have his gun rights revoked go home
with his guns than to have someone falsely accused lose his guns.

The risk is not enough to deprive citizens of their due process rights.
