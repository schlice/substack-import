**If we\'re going to require teachers to be armed to fight school
shooters, why don\'t we just require students to be armed as well just
in case the teachers get shot?**

A common misconception. We're not ***requiring*** teachers to be armed.

We're ***allowing*** teachers ***who choose to be independently licensed
and certified*** to do so.

You might find it interesting to know that many teachers, on their own,
are already gun owners and are already concealed carry holders, but they
are not authorized to carry their firearms in a school. What we're doing
is allowing them to exercise the rights they already have within their
state, within a school.

Arming students is therefore unnecessary.
