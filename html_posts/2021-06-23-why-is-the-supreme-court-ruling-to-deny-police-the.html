So it seems you're talking about *Lange v. California*. In the *Lange*
case, the court ruled that a fleeing **misdemeanor** suspect (known as a
*misdemeanant*) who flees into a home may not always be pursued without
a warrant.

This is a victory for Fourth Amendment Constitutionalists, as it limits
the exceptions to its protections. But it also leads to a quagmire of
legal decisions for an officer, and will eventually lead to *every* case
where someone suspected of a misdemeanor who was followed into his home
ending up as a lawsuit. So it's a win for lawyers, too.

Taking away bright-line rules for police officers is never a good idea.
