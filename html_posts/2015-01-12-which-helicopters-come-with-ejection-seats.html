**Content:** [Helicopters very rarely have ejection seats, as it\'s
challenging to get a person up and out through the arc of spinning
blades waiting to chop them to pieces. However, the Ka-50 \"Black
Shark\" and the Ka-52 \"Alligator\", with their distinctive
counter-rotating blades, is one model of helicopter with ejection seats.
When the ejection handles are pulled, the blades are blown away from the
central rotor disc by explosive charges, and then the canopy is blown
off, also by explosive charges. Finally, the crew is ejected.\
\
Some work was done in the US in fitting a similar system to the Russian
ejectors in the AH-1 Cobra attack helo, but this was never
completed.]{.rendered_qtext}
