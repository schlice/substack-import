Sure, some would. But Christians would not. Why? **Because he didn't
show up the way Jesus is going to show up.**

How is Jesus going to show up? Check the Spark Notes (or if you're a
Gen-X'er, the Cliff Notes). We Christians call them "the Bible," but I'm
trying to be inclusive here...

This was the scene right after Jesus was assumed bodily into Heaven. So
the Bible is clear that when Jesus returns, He will descend from Heaven
in exactly the same way as the disciples saw Him assumed into Heaven.

The Bible also tells us about all the events that will take place
***before*** Jesus comes back, and if those things didn't happen in the
world, then it's unlikely that the person standing there is actually
Jesus.

Finally, when Jesus comes back, *a whole lotta stuff is going to start
happening*, and you won't need this guy telling you he's Jesus in order
to know that he's Jesus. Like, this stuff will pretty much dwarf any of
us. Cataclysmic type events across the globe.

You'll know. He won't even have to say it.

In fact, ***everyone in the world will know it.*** Again, to reference
the Spark Notes:

> *so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on
> earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ
> is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. \-- Phillipians 2:10--11 ESV*

When He comes back, ***every*** knee will bow, and ***every*** tongue
will confess that Jesus is Lord, whether they do so willingly or
unwillingly. And you can guess what the Spark Notes say about those who
are not willing to bend the knee, but are *made* to bend the knee.

I don't really have to say it, do I? Oh, very well...

> *And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous

Always check the Spark Notes...
