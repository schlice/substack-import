They tell you "I have a hidden disability."

Other than that, the point is that the disability is "hidden," which
means it doesn't produce any visible symptoms.

Which generally produces the response, "Wow, ***but you look so
good..."***

The dichotomy that then goes on in the mind of such a disabled person
is, "It's strange that I **look so good on the outside,** when I **feel
so bad on the inside.**"

The short answer is that you cannot identify someone with a hidden
disability unless they tell you.
