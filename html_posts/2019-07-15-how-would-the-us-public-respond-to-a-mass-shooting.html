**How would the US public respond to a mass shooting by the military of
those civilians storming Area 51?**

Oh, there will be plenty of outrage. But it won't change a thing.

Make no mistake, the security of our classified assets is no joke.
Defying orders of military police tasked with protecting these
facilities can indeed lead to getting yourself shot. Anyone thinking of
storming Area 51 must understand that they place their own life in their
hands.

But I can tell you, *it will never get to that point.*

No one will be able to get *anywhere near* Area 51. Doesn't matter how
many of them are there.

There is a buffer zone around the facility, patrolled routinely by
military contractors. Anyone approaching the buffer zone will be dealt
with by the local sheriff. I think the sheriff's office will be able to
deter the largest majority of civilians before they ever breach the
outer border.

Beyond the buffer zone, it is even classified if, and how many, people
have been killed by the military. We probably ought not to think about
that kind of stuff. Because I'm sure it won't get to that.
