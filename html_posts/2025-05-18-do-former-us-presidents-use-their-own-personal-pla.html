Former US presidents, ever since Dwight D. Eisenhower, can fly on
government aircraft after they leave office, including military VIP
transport (like the Air Force C-21) as well as the same air transport
fleet used by the current president, including the Boeing VC-25 (which
is commonly known as Air Force One when the current President is on
board).

Additionally, US presidents can charter an airplane, the cost of which
is covered by the government under the Former Presidents Act.
