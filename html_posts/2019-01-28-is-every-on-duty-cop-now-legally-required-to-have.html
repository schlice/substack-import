**Is every on duty cop now legally required to have a body camera?**

In the context of this question, I'll assuming you're referring to the
nearly one million police officers in the more than 18,000 law
enforcement agencies across the country. And in that context, I can
emphatically say **no**, not every cop is legally required to have a
body camera.

Maybe every cop in a single city, or maybe even every cop in a single
state, *may* be required to have a body camera, but that would require
levels of funding that not every department or every state has, and it
is highly dependent on the state or the city.

In fact, there are scant few *laws* that require body cameras anywhere
in the country. Use of body cameras is generally regulated by the
department, at the direction of their governing body. It is not
generally mandated by law. Mostly this is due to the aforementioned
funding issues surrounding use of the cameras.
