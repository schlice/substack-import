The first thing the government would have to do would be to repeal the
2nd, 4th, 5th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution, as well as
Article 1, Paragraphs 9 and 10 (they could accomplish such a major
re-write during a Constitutional Convention, but because it would be so
easy to make wholesale changes to large swaths of the Constitution,
states will never authorize such a measure). Specifically, problematic
areas of each of those Amendments:

- 2nd Amendment: Right to Keep and Bear Arms
- 4th Amendment: Right to be Free from Unreasonable Search and Seizure
- 5th Amendment: Due Process clause
- 14th Amendment: Applied Due Process to states
- Article 1 Paragraphs 9 and 10: Prevent *ex post facto* laws

So assuming that they could pass a Constitutional amendment that would
repeal the above-listed Amendments and repeal Paragraphs 9 and 10 from
Article 1, they could then pass a law making all guns currently owned by
citizens illegal. Since you are criminalizing behavior that was
previously illegal, you would have to repeal Article 1 Paragraphs 9 and
10 to allow you write such an *ex post facto* law. Once you have made
gun ownership illegal, you can force citizens to turn in their guns and
you wouldn\'t have to reimburse them for the guns, since you repealed
the 5th and 14th Amendments. That will save you tons of cash. Which is
good, because you\'ll need it for the next phase.

If there were still guns in circulation (you might, on a good day, get
5% of guns turned in voluntarily), you could then authorize the police
to go door-to-door to search every house for weapons, and confiscate all
the ones you find (your repeal of the 4th Amendment would make this
legal). The military is specifically prevented from enforcing any
civilian laws under the Posse Comitatus Act, so only local police can
accomplish this task. The National Guard can only enforce state laws, so
unless a state repealed its own gun protections and outlawed guns (also
no guarantees there), the National Guard could also not enforce such a
law.

The police would be heavily stretched as they would have to employ
off-duty officers, working overtime, to perform all the confiscations,
and that funding would need to come from the Federal government. The
cost for the overtime alone would be in the hundreds of millions of
dollars. Then the weapons would have to be shipped somewhere and
destroyed, another cost in the tens of millions of dollars.

This wouldn\'t stop the illegal flow of weapons into the country, and
also wouldn\'t prevent some gun nut from burying his guns (I assume many
would), so you still would go through all this effort and 1. criminals
would still have and acquire guns, 2. you\'d never get them all, and 3.
you\'d instantly create criminals out of formerly law-abiding citizens,
many will choose to remain that way (look at the mandatory registration
in Connecticut as an example). All of those hundreds of millions of
dollars spent and guns will still be there.
