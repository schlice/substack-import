I think that when you say Section 504, you are talking about the
equality in education section of federal law. Basically, that section
says that regardless of your disability, you have the right to equal
access to education. Your church is not an educational institution under
the control of the state, therefore Section 504 does not apply to your
church.

However, if you told the leaders of your youth group that you had a
disability and you would benefit from an accommodation in order to
equally participate with everyone else, I am absolutely certain that
they would go out of their way to accommodate you, so that you could
have an equal experience to everyone else.

If you actually meant something else, please reply and let me know, and
I\'ll see if I can help you.
