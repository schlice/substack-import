**Do Home owners Associations really have any authority?**

Thanks for the A2A. The answer is it depends on the state.

In Colorado, for example, the state legislature passed the Colorado
Common Interest Ownership Act (CCIOA), which gives HOAs broad authority
to act with in the areas they control.

An HOA has an "ownership interest" in your house; they don't "own" it
outright. An ownership interest means they can place a
"[[lien](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8065ef&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lien){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}" on your house.
Generally, only organizations which have a
"[[nonpossessory](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=434748&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonpossessory_interest_in_land){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} security interest" in
your property can place liens.

Interestingly (and why it works in Colorado), while the *legislature*
seeks to give HOAs broad control over their areas, the *judiciary*
limits HOAs to the most narrow possible definition of the law that they
can get away with. So while it may be legal for something to happen
under the law, the courts will apply as strict scrutiny to the HOA as
that law will permit.

Other states will be different.

Only a licensed real estate attorney in your area who specializes in HOA
law can tell you for certain what any implications will be for your
particular situation.
