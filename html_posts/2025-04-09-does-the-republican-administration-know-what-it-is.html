The world is playing tiddly winks while Trump is playing 4-D chess. At
the same time that the administration delayed some tariffs for 90 days,
they imposed a 125% tariff on Chinese products. So they're suspending
tariffs on other countries, but raising tariffs on China.

Do you see what's happening here? **This isn't about tariffs. It's
about** ***China.*** China has been systematically stealing our stuff
for decades. They steal our intellectual property, produce cheap
knock-offs of our stuff, and sell it back to us, in our own marketplaces
(ahem, Amazon), and undercut the people who actually created the stuff.

They've been part of the World Trade Organization for decades, and they
have **never** abided by any of the rules *they agreed to* for all of
that time.

Could this cause a short-term rise in some product prices? Sure. But
China will back down. President Xi can only stay in power so long as his
people are employed. Once tariffs get so high that people stop buying
Chinese products and Chinese workers start losing their jobs, they're
going to start looking for new leadership in Beijing.

Once we raise tariffs high enough, Xi will start negotiating. We cannot
crack down on the theft of IP in China. China has to crack down on the
theft of IP in China. We just need to give China the right "motivation"
to start playing by the rules.

This is how we protect America. This is how we put American workers and
American entrepreneurs first. This is how we put American businesses
first. Love him or hate him, Trump is doing ***exactly*** what he was
elected to do.

Making it up as they go along? Hardly. *They're the only ones with the
plan.*
