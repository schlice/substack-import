To answer the specific question:

> **Can I file a lien on someone's property if they committed fraud and
> theft by deception?**

In specific, **no.**

Fraud and theft by deception, especially in the scale in which you are
discussing, are **crimes** which are prosecuted by the district
attorney. *You* will not receive anything from that prosecution, as you
are not the prosecution, the state is. If prosecuted, the defendant will
most likely spend time in jail.

Once the crime has been prosecuted, you can *sue* for theft and fraud.
You will have to provide the bill of sale and proof that you paid, and
then you'll have to show that you never received the property.

There are several types of damages you can receive:

- **Compensatory damages**. You can be compensated for the actual
  financial loss you suffered.
- **Loss of revenue.** If the 11 mobile homes were to be rental
  property, you can receive the rental income you were going to get had
  you gotten the property and rented it out.
- **Punitive damages.** These are damages designed to punish the
  defendant for outrageous conduct and/or to reform or deter the
  defendant and others from engaging in conduct similar to that which
  formed the basis of the lawsuit.

*(You may be entitled to others; your legal team will help you sort that
out)*

It's unlikely that you'd actually receive the property *directly* when
all is said and done, but you can still get it, and it depends on
whether or not there is a mortgage on the property. If the property is
mortgaged, the property will revert ownership to the mortgage holder,
and if it is not, the state will take ownership of the property. The
mortgage holder will re-sell the property, and the state would auction
off the property. Once you receive all the money from your lawsuit, you
can use some of it to re-purchase the property.

While none of these outcomes are guaranteed, this is the most likely
outcome for a case like this.
