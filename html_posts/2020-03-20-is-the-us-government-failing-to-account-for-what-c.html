**Is the U.S. government failing to account for what could be thousands
of additional infections because of ongoing problems with testing?**

Clearly, we will miss some infection by only testing those with
symptoms. Remember, **people can be contagious with no visible outward
symptoms of disease**.

However, while this does impact our accounting, it has no effect on the
spread of the virus. Only isolation and social distancing can prevent
the spread of the virus.

Testing does not prevent or cure disease.
