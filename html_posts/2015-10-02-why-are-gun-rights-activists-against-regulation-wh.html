**Content:** [Well-regulated does not mean \"an abundance of good rules
and regulations.\"\
\
Well-regulated means \"well-functioning.\" Think of a grandfather clock.
Its \"regulation\" allows it to keep time accurately. A well-regulated
grandfather clock will keep time accurately for years.\
\
Well-regulated, in terms of guns, means that their guns are serviceable,
and able to be employed at a moment\'s notice.]{.rendered_qtext}
