The media hates Donald Trump with a fiery passion. They will do anything
and everything they can to discredit, destroy, and utterly annihilate
him. They will even re-work their core principles so that they buddy up
with other groups which also hate Trump. No more "centrist to a fault,"
the media now gleefully jumps into bed with the DNC so that together,
they can destroy Trump. Hasn't worked so far, but they won't stop
trying.

So it's no surprise that the media gets behind any effort to sideline
Trump and make him insignificant, including backing certain Republicans
who think the party should distance itself from Trump in order to win in
2022. They excitedly scream, "Yes! Yes! Do what he says!" while pointing
at the Republicans who want to sideline Trump, bouncing up and down like
giddy schoolgirls.

I will be completely honest: I don't know whether or not the Republican
party should distance itself from Trump. I don't know if that would be
beneficial or harmful to the party. I haven't really decided yet.

But why the media wants Republicans to distance themselves from Trump is
an easy answer.

Original question:

Why does the media want the Republican Party to distance itself from
Donald Trump in order to win in 2022 when many GOP like Lindsey Graham
feel that they can't move on without him?
