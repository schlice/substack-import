**How do I get the med I chose, insurance denied it twice?**

First, you *and your doctor* should choose your medication together.

Secondly, there is likely a reason that your insurance company is
denying the medication. Perhaps they feel that there is a cheaper
medication which would produce the same results. Your doctor should be
fighting for you to try to convince insurance that you need the
medication you are trying to get.

Finally, there are other ways to get your medication paid. In the case
of MS, contact your [[local chapter of the National MS
Society](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2ebc99&url=https://www.nationalmssociety.org/Chapters){.external_link

direct you to resources which provide assistance for medication costs.
Look for an affinity group for your disease to see if there are any
assistance programs which can help with medication costs.
