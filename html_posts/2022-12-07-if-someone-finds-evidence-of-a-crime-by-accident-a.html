No. They *could* only be charged with a crime if they were committing a
crime when they discovered the evidence of another crime.

They tell a story in the police academy of a burglar robbing a business
when he stumbles on a 55-gallon drum filled with drugs. He reports this
to the police, and honestly tells them that he was in the process of
robbing the place when he found the drum. He reports that he ceased his
robbery and immediately vacated the premises and reported what he found
to police.

*Could* he be charged with a crime? Yes he could, he could be charged
with the breaking and entering he admitted to. But would he be charged
with a *drug charge*? No, he would not.

Similarly, if you *accidentally* find evidence of a crime and report it
to the police, so long as your accident is verified (you weren't
actually committing another crime at the time) and you weren't involved
in the crime you are reporting, you won't be charged.
