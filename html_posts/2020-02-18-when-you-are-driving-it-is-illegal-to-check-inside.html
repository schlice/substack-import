**When you are driving, it is illegal to check inside of your car. Can
police do an illegal check on your car?**

First of all, you begin with an erroneous statement. You said that it is
illegal for police to check inside of your car. This is incorrect.

What makes a search legal or illegal is the **probable cause** upon
which the search is based. If the officer has probable cause, he can
search your car. He doesn't have to tell *you* what probable cause he
has. He only has to tell the judge. He doesn't need your permission.

Also, you didn't clarify what "check inside of your car" means. Does
that mean a search, or does it mean looking through the window with a
flashlight? I've been talking about search, but can an officer check for
threats by looking in the window? Absolutely. And if he ***sees***
something illegal while checking for a threat, is that admissible? Under
the **plain sight** doctrine, the answer to that is also yes.

Finally, you asked the question: **Can police do an illegal check on
your car?** And the answer to that is **yes**, the police can illegally
search your car. While it's not a frequent occurrence, sometimes the
police do search vehicles illegally.

But what happens when they do?

You work with your lawyer, you get the search thrown out, and you walk
free. Then if you choose, you sue the department. But that's between you
and your lawyer.
