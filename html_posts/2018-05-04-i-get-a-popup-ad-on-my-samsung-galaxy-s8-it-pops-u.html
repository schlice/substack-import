**I get a popup ad on my Samsung Galaxy S8+. It pops up no matter what I
am doing and even on a locked screen and I hear sudden sounds from my
phone. How do I get rid of it?**

You downloaded an app which places popup ads on your screen. It doesn't
necessarily have to be a "hacked" app; some apps just do this as a
matter of course. By downloading and installing the app, you agreed to
allow it to place ads on your phone. That's part of that End User
Agreement that no one ever reads before just clicking OK.

While you can't directly find which app is causing the popup, you can
examine all of your apps and see the kind of ad services they use, and
which ones might be causing full-screen ads to appear. I would suggest
downloading
[[Anti-Adware](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8f2205&url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id%3Dcom.keerby.adaware%26hl%3Den_US){.external_link

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="google.com"}]{.qlink_container} from the Google Play Store
and performing a full system scan. Once it's complete, examine each of
the apps which can show ads and look for the "High-Risk" apps (they will
show up in red) which can show ads outside of the app itself, such as in
the notification area and full-screen ads outside of the app. I'd start
by uninstalling those, and see if the situation improves.
