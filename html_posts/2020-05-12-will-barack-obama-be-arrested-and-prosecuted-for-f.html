**Will Barack Obama be arrested and prosecuted for framing Michael
Flynn?**

Of course not.

But it does belie the statement that Obama was not involved in the
process of opening the counterintelligence investigation into the Trump
campaign. He was involved. Heavily.

When Obama makes the statement that his administration was the most
transparent, the most scandal-free in history, that is another
bald-faced lie. When the meeting in the Oval Office on January 5th took
place with Obama, Clapper, Brennan, Comey, Biden, Sally Yates, and a few
others, they discussed how to get the Steele dossier covered by the
media. It was already public knowledge, and they all knew that it was a
steaming pile of turd. The media didn't cover it very thoroughly though
because it wasn't really newsworthy. They needed to get some power
behind it, so they put the plan together, and implemented it the very
next day. They went to Trump Tower and briefed Trump about the dossier,
and then leaked to the media that Trump had been briefed about it.
*This* made it newsworthy, because the President had been briefed about
it.

We knew intuitivey that the whole Russia collusion thing could not have
happened without Obama knowing about it.

Now we find out that not only did he know about it, but he *spearheaded*
it. Now that the full, unredacted documents have been released, we see
that not only did Obama know about it, but he coordinated it. He
approved it.

Then, after that meeting, he kept Comey and Yates around discussing
Flynn and his call with Kislyak and about how they could trick him into
lying so that they could pursue criminal prosecution or get him fired
(both of which happened). Yates brought up that maybe they could get him
on the Logan Act. And Yates said (paraphrasing), *Oh my goodness. Look
at this! What are we trying to do? Are we trying to get the guy fired or
are we getting him to lie for a perjury trap?*

Obama knew about that as well. None of this would have happened without
his knowledge, and it did not happen without his approval.

Will he ever be held to account for this? Probably not. But it's all out
in the open now.

*Sorry, no comments on this one.*

*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is
grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,
downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora
is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply
going to comment to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" then you're
the reason why I disable comments. Well done, Karen. You ruined it for
everyone.*
