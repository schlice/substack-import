As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."

In this case, it depends on whether or not the movie is going to *make
money.*

For example, if the movie in question is a public service announcement,
or a news story, you may not need to get permission, even though it is
highly recommended.

The question turns on whether or not the movie is using someone else\'s
name, likeness, or other personal attributes without permission *for an
exploitative purpose.*

Don\'t get hung up on terminology here, "exploitative purpose\"
essentially just means where somebody makes profit from the movie. This
doesn\'t mean that if a nonprofit corporation makes money at all, the
movie "made money." A non-profit corporation can make a movie that
doesn\'t sell tickets. The non-profit corporation can still make money
from their advertised nonprofit endeavors without making money from the
movie.

Nevertheless, as a general rule, if you use anyone\'s name or likeness
in any sort of media production, it is always best practice to get their
permission.

If you have experienced a situation in which someone has used your name
or likeness in a movie without your permission, and you think you may
have a claim, it is imperative that you contact a licensed attorney in
your area who specializes in copyright law, to assist you with
determining whether or not you have a claim for invasion of privacy
through misappropriation of name or likeness (\"misappropriation\"), or
violation of the right of publicity.
