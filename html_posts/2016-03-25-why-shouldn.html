The article and video leave massive gaps in the story. We don\'t know
what really happened here. We have a partial story from the defendant.
We do not have any official police statements. We don\'t even have the
full official testimony of the defendant. Were there witnesses to what
happened before the video? Was there any other video evidence? Is there
dashcam video? It\'s impossible to even partially analyze the situation
without the full accounting of what happened.

That\'s what court is for.

Update us after the mailman has his day in court, and we\'ll see.
