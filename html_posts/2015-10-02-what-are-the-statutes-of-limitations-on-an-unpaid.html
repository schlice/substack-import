**Content:** [You have asked a specific legal question, and you need to
once again consult an attorney to get actual, actionable advice.\
\
In general, in New York, the statute of limitation on debts is 6 years
(or so Google tells me). This is for oral, written, promissory, or
open-ended debts (like credit cards). So yes, it\'s still appropriate to
consult with an attorney to seek repayment of the
debt.]{.rendered_qtext}
