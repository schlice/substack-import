Nope. I mean he can try, which he may do for publicity, but it won't
win.

Calling someone a name is not against the law. It's protected speech
under the First Amendment. Defamation of character has a pretty high bar
to meet before it can really be seriously looked at. She would have to
have:

- Made a false statement. The statement must actually be false; truth is
  always a defense to defamation. She's got this one nailed; I doubt she
  has details of a crime when prosecutors for years have been unable to
  find them. And if she does know something and didn't tell anyone,
  she's going to be looked at pretty skeptically.
- Broadcast that statement. Clearly, if this question is being asked,
  she's done that.
- Acted with actual malice. Because Trump is a public figure, the
  standards for defamation are higher. It would have to be proved that
  she acted with *actual malice,* meaning that she knew the statement
  was false or that she acted with reckless disregard of the truth.
- Damaged his reputation. This false statement would have to be shown to
  have been harmful to Trump's reputation. But given
  Trump's...colorful...reputation, I doubt AOC could even move the
  needle on that front.

So while he *can* sue her, he won't, because he won't waste his time on
the likes of her, and even if he did, there's no way in The Hot Placeâ„¢
that he'd win.
