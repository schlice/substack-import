Whether they do or not, the outcome will be the same. Trump is still
going to take office in January.

If anything at all comes of this investigation, it will happen after
Trump is inaugurated. At worst, Trump would be indicted, and then the
Senate would have to impeach him. If they do, the vice president will
then become president.

However, to be fair, I don\'t see any of that happening. To me, the
timing is just too coincidental. For an incident that happened over 25
years ago to be coming to light right now seems a bit too sketchy to me.

She should\'ve come forward a year ago, and derailed his entire
presidential election campaign. It\'s a bit too late to stop his
election now.
