I just finished reading a book series by David Simpson called,
collectively, the \"Post-Human Series.\" If you like sci-fi, dystopian
future stories, limits of human intelligence, etc., you\'ll really like
that series.

One of the overarching themes in that series was the following:

*\"Feelings are never wrong. Acting on those feelings may be, but
feelings themselves are never wrong.\"*

So with that in mind, let\'s answer your questions:

*Can a happily married man fall in love with someone else?*\
I would have to say, within the bounds of this question, **no**.

Why? Because if he\'s a truly happily married man, he won\'t get
involved with another woman to such an extent that he has an opportunity
to fall in love. Love is more than skin-deep, so \"love at first sight\"
is a misnomer. You can\'t love someone you don\'t know. You can find a
strong physical attraction when you visualize someone (and men are
highly visual creatures), and thus the phrase is more accurately said as
\"lust at first sight,\" but in my opinion you have to truly know
someone to love them. If you truly love someone for everything they are,
you would have to really know them to love them.

In this context then, if a \"happily\" married man falls in love with
another woman, he needs to do some serious soul-searching about what it
is in his marriage that makes him \"happy\" and why he finds it so easy
to fall in love with someone else. My guess is that he will find that
he\'s not quite as \"happy\" in his marriage as he thinks.

Once that analysis is completed, he\'ll have a better understanding
about what to do. Is he truly unhappy in his marriage? If he is, he
needs to give his wife a chance. He needs to talk to her and explain
what he is feeling and what he has discovered is missing from his
marriage. Remember, the key to a happy marriage is communication. When
communication breaks down, everything else falls like dominos.

But the discovery that a \"happily\" married man can fall in love with
someone else is a signal that the man is not actually \"happy\" in his
marriage at all.
