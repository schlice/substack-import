This pretty much sums up what it means:

Specifically, it means several things:

- We don't have to worry about calls for repeal of the PLCAA (Protection
  of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act), which protects gun manufacturers from
  liability and lawsuits simply when properly-functioning guns are used
  illegally
- We don't have to worry (quite so much) about calls for "common-sense
  gun regulations" which, as we've learned under an Obama
  administration, are really calls to reduce access to guns for
  law-abiding citizens to try and control lawlessness, and for silly
  regulations that govern cosmetic changes and limitations on
  standard-sized magazines.

And the big one:

- We don't have to worry that our government will support hate groups
  like Black Lives Matter and their defense and encouragement of open
  murder of police officers. We can be certain that if anything can be
  done to crack down on those types of ideas, it will be done. Don't get
  me wrong, if they have legitimate complaints, we'd be happy to hear
  them, but so far they have spewed nothing but lies, hate, and vitriol.
  We don't need that.

Some other pro-2A legislation we may see:

- Congress may propose "nationwide concealed carry" or "national
  reciprocity" such that any state would recognize the concealed carry
  permits issued in any other state, assuming a minimum level of
  training and background checking is performed by every state (which
  also, by extension, standardizes currently disparate training and
  background check requirements across the states).
- Congress may seek to standardize punishments for using a gun in the
  commission of a crime, making those charges mandatory and not subject
  to plea bargaining.

What it will also mean:

- Declining gun sales. When there is no threat that "guns will be taken
  away" or severely limited, sales of new guns will go down. Fear is a
  great motivator. When there is no fear, there is little motivation.
