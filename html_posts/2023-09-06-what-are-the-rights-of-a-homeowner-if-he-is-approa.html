The homeowner in possession of the title deed to the property (or the
named individual on the mortgage) retains ownership of the property
while the claimant hires an attorney and attempts to make a claim on the
property. The process works its way through the courts until either the
claimant or the title holder is successful.

If the claimant is found to be the rightful owner, the current deed will
be declared null and void, and new lawsuits will ensue because the
current residents have been paying for a property which they are not
entitled to own, and they will want just compensation for that error.
The two parties will work out a suitable arrangement which will allow
the current residents to vacate the property in a reasonable amount of
time.

If the title holder is found to be the rightful owner, the claimant goes
away.
