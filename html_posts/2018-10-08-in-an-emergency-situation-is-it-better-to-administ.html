**In an emergency situation, is it better to administer first aid or
avoid it at all costs in case of being sued?**

While my first instinct is to tell you to always assist because "Good
Samaritan laws," the reality is that there is no Federal Good Samaritan
Law. These laws are all state laws, and they vary by state. You should
be thinking about what you might do should you find yourself in this
situation, and you should think about that now. Research your state's
laws and how they might apply to you.

The bottom line is that *as long as you act reasonably when you help,
you should not be liable in a state which has Good Samaritan laws.*
Reasonableness is determined partly by what you do for a living. If you
are a medical professional, your standard of reasonableness is different
than someone who is not involved in medicine. If you're not involved in
medicine, it may be reasonable to simply call 911 and to ensure that no
one is hurt *further*. If you *are* in medicine, you should also know
that Good Samaritan laws are not applicable while you're at work.

It's also important to note that even if a Good Samaritan law exists,
this does not mean you cannot be sued. If you act recklessly or
unreasonably, you can still be sued for damages, even if your state has
Good Samaritan laws in place. Finally, Good Samaritan laws don't apply
to your *employer*. If you act, or fail to act, you may not be able to
be sued or be criminally liable, but your employer can take action if
your response doesn't match their expectations. For example, if you are
told to always call the employer's security team for medical care, and
you fail to do that, you can still face disciplinary action from your
employer for violating their rules, even if the victim can't sue you in
that state.
