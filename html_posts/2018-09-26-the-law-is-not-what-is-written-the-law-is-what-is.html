**"The law is not what is written, the law is what is revealed to you
when you follow your conscience." To what extent do you agree/disagree
with this statement?**

I fully and wholeheartedly disagree with this statement.

The law *exactly is* what's written, it can't be any other way, and it
can't because **when I follow my conscience, and when you follow your
conscience, we may not arrive at the same place.**

Following your conscience is great. Having a sound moral compass is a
feature of a well-fashioned life. But not everyone has that feature in
their lives, and *basing a system of law on following conscience means
that there is no common baseline* for people to point to.

In short, follow your conscience, but the law is the law, and it can
only be what is written, so that it applies equally and similarly to all
people.
