One exception to the Double Jeopardy clause that I know of is the
concurrent jurisdiction of the military and civilian authorities.

In such a case (where a military member commits a crime recognized in
both jurisdictions), one jurisdiction will try the individual first
(usually the military is given preference). That jurisdiction can try,
convict, and sentence the individual to prison (and in military prison,
they still do hard labor, turning big rocks into little rocks). At the
conclusion of the sentence, when the person is released from military
prison, civilian authorities can arrest the individual and try him again
***for the exact same crime***. He can be tried, convicted, and
sentenced to civilian prison and serve a second sentence in a civilian
prison for the exact same crime for which he was just released from a
military prison.

In this instance, double jeopardy does not apply.
