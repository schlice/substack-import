- Selling one car is a personal transaction.
- Continuously selling cars is running a business.

You can sell **a** car from your driveway. That's a private transaction,
and regardless, by the time anyone got wind of it, you'd have the car
sold (nothing to see here, move along.

Selling **multiple** cars, or receiving and reselling cars on an ongoing
basis, is a **business** and will rightly be regulated by the HOA and
your local zoning laws. The problems are numerous: increased traffic in
a residential area, danger to property, among others.

So it's not only your HOA you'd have to convince, but your local
government too. I wouldn't expect to get real far with that. They'll
tell you to open a storefront.
