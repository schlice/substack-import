<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Piggybacking on Steve\'s answer, Dick met an Israeli tank<br>driver named Moshe Yanai, who had a great idea for an integrated cached<br>disk array, and the Symmetrix was born. For more than 20 years,<br>Symmetrix has been the gold standard by which other disk arrays are<br>measured. The design has been refined and improved over the years (most<br>recently incorporating a Direct Matrix architecture, eliminating the<br>delay in the data busses), but it still remains the uncontested champion<br>of the storage array world.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
