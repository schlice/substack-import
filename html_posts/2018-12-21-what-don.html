**What don\'t people tell you about living with Multiple sclerosis?**

*You have MS?* ***But you look so good...***

UGH! If I hear that sentence again, I think I'll scream.

When you get MS, it doesn't matter what your symptoms are or how long
you have lived with the disease, it is guaranteed that you will hear
that phrase at least once, from some well-meaning person who only knows
MS because they know Carrie Fisher or Richard Pryor or someone else who
was in a wheelchair or who had to use a cane.

Or they follow up that sentence with, "All of the guys I know who have
MS just look terrible and they never did very well, but not you! *You
look so good!*"

I always want to say, "So what, exactly, is a person with MS *supposed*
to look like?"

And if you are like me and you have issues with fatigue, it may be that
the walk through the hot parking lot will be the difference between
whether or not you can have dinner with your family that night, or that
you'll have to go to bed early because you're just too tired. Hanging a
handicapped parking tag and then walking in to the store will elicit
more than one dirty look from people who judge you because you don't
"look" handicapped.

The fundamental reality of MS is that in the vast majority of cases,
**how you look on the outside will not correlate with how you feel on
the inside.**
