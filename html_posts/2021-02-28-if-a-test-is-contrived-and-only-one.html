**If a test is contrived and only one "religion" is allowed to pass,
does that violate freedom of religion and other rights afforded under
the US Constitution? If so, should Christians engaged in unlawful
testing be prosecuted under the RICO statute?**

Only if it was the government that administered the test, and if by
"failing" the test, you were denied equal access to some government
service or benefit, then yes, this test would be illegal. The government
cannot show *preference* for any one religion.
