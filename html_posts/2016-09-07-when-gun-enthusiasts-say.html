You've heard that violation of these laws is rarely charged. The result
at the prosecutor's table, when they are actually charged, is that they
are used as bargaining chips in plea deals. Prosecutors will agree to
drop the gun charges in exchange for guilty pleas on the actual crime.
So even when the charges are actually levied, they are not treated with
much seriousness, because prosecutors appear to be more worried about
"wins" than charges.

In order to fix this, we would need to change the law. We would need to
make it so that when a crime is committed with a gun, the gun charges
must be applied (not optional). We would also have to specify that the
gun charges cannot be removed via plea bargain. Finally, we must set a
**minimum** mandatory sentence, not a simple mandatory sentence. We must
set a floor below which a sentence could not go for that charge.

(EDIT) Also, we have to ensure that the sentence for the gun charge runs
*consecutively* with any other sentences, not *concurrently*. So if you
do a crime with a gun, you're getting a minimum of five years in jail,
regardless of what other charges are filed or what other sentences are
handed down.

Until we do this, we will never see criminals be serious about the fact
that they commit crimes with guns. They will use guns with impunity,
knowing that in plea bargain, they can usually get the gun charges
thrown out. They do a minimum amount of time in jail, and they walk
free.
