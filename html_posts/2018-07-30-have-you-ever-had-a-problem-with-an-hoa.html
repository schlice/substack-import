I spent three years as the president of our neighborhood's HOA, and
I\'ve had problems with other boards, especially on the boards that
I\'ve not been a part of.

Specifically, I have a problem with the board when it doesn\'t follow
its own policies. As a legal type person, I spent a lot of time writing
and revising the HOA's rules and regulations. Our most controversial
rule is the one that says that all owners and long-term guests must park
their cars in a driveway or in a garage, not on the street. You have 10
days as a guest that you are allowed to park in the street. After that,
you are considered a long-term guest, and you are required to follow the
parking rules that are laid out for homeowners.

if that is the case, then why would I receive a courtesy notice about
parking in the street after just one day of any vehicle's presence?
Either their parking enforcement procedure has become highly efficient,
or they\'re sending their courtesy notices just a little bit too early.
I should only get a notice in the mail if you see my car in the street
for more than 10 days.

To be fair, our managing agent changed at the same time that I left the
board. So I can understand if a few policies are not being implemented
exactly the way that I would have. Nevertheless, I still expect the
board to follow its own policies.
