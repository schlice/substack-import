**How exactly will Trump\'s executive order prevent children of illegal
immigrants from being separated from their families? How does it jibe
with existing law? Why wasn\'t this done before? What is the background?
What are the implications?**

I will be quite honest: Trumps EO is *patently illegal.*

The law (which is a combination of ICE policy and case law) says, quite
specifically, that children shall not be incarcerated for more than 20
days. The 9th Circus upheld this rule, clarifying that both
*accompanied* and *unaccompanied* children are all covered by this rule.
20 days, no more. See the *Flores* decision for more information.

After 20 days, the children must leave incarceration.

Beginning in the Bush Administration, and continuing into the Obama
Administration, when an illegal immigrant entered with a child in tow
and claimed asylum (which forced a hearing with an immigration judge),
the parent and child would be incarcerated together. However, if they
were unable to get in to see an immigration judge within 20 days, the
policy was to give them a court date, and release them *together* into
the United States. This policy was known as "catch and release." Most of
the time, the illegal would make it back for their court date. Some
unscrupulous illegals would take advantage of this, and not return for
their hearing, being loose in the United States as an illegal alien.
They would bring children *who were not theirs* across the border with
them so that they would be treated as parent and child. They'd pay for
children to pretend that they were actually their children so that they
would get out of incarceration because of the way the law was being
implemented. Basically, the United States was encouraging lawlessness
and child slavery purchases to enable unscrupulous illegals to enter the
country as "parent and child." This is a perfect example of a
well-intentioned policy with disastrous unintended consequences. Yes, it
worked some of the time, but not always. Just ask Angel Moms how well
this policy worked.

Trump's policy change was the implementation of a "zero tolerance"
policy when it comes to adherence to the law, which said that we would
end the practice of "catch and release." To that end, if the above
scenario happened and we got to 20 days without a hearing, the illegal
would not be released into the country. However, the child would have to
be removed from incarceration because of the law barring children from
remaining in incarceration for more than 20 days. Nothing changing the
law happened with Trump, only how the law was enforced. Trump did not
make the policy. He simply enforced it.

Democratic lawmakers attempted to capitalize on this for political
points, insisting that the President should change the policy by
Executive Order. They knew **full well** that the problem was theirs to
fix, but they were banking on stupid voters to believe that this was all
Trump's doing. Trump was ripping families apart for his own amusement,
they said. It fits their "Trump is a monster" narrative, so it works, so
long as you can suspend your understanding of the situation and the law.

Under growing pressure, Trump issued an EO which said that children
would not be removed from incarceration despite passing the 20 day mark.
The law has not changed. Therefore, this is indeed, illegal. What he
*also* did was to have the Justice Department petition the 9th Circuit
for a change in the case law. This might allow his EO to be legal, if
it's done soon enough. We'll have to wait and see how that works out.

For now, parents and children get to stay together, which is what
everyone wanted. Interesting that Democrats were not satisfied, because
ultimately they wanted a return to "catch and release." They were not
really concerned about the welfare of children, or they'd be satisfied
that children are not being ripped for their mommy's arms, so to speak.
Trump is not going to re-implement catch and release.

Trump was in a bad situation here, and to be fair, his administration
did not handle this incident in the most stellar way, when you have
senior administration officials saying that the policy was intended to
"send a message." What they meant to say was that the change in policy
was to close the loophole we mentioned above regarding illegals buying
children to use as their own so that they'd be released from custody in
20 days; essentially, a "free pass" into the country. That's the message
they wanted to send. However, it came out totally wrong, and they made
it sound like Trump was ripping children from parents as a deterrent.
Terribly poor handling all around. Trump needs a communications director
who will actually set communication policy for the administration, and
hold administration officials' feet to the fire on it. Alas, they all
run their mouths and they have inconsistent messaging.
