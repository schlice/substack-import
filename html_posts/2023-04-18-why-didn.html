**Because bad things happen to good people, all the time. The fact that
you think God** ***should have*** **prevented it is your problem, not
His.**

Seriously, where do non-Christians get this idea that God is responsible
for preventing all the bad things in your life? Like He skips ahead of
us through our life's journey with his great cosmic leaf-blower, blowing
away all of our troubles. Where did this idea even come from?

Best I can tell, your reasoning (or at least the reasoning of people who
think like you) is something like this:

> Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not
> omnipotent.\
> Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent.\
> Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil?\
> Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God? --- Epicurus

You've assigned God to these arbitrary categories based on your own
feelings. God is certainly able to prevent evil, but He has not done it
yet.

You: (stomping feet like a petulant child): *Why why why why? I want it
NOW!*

Yeah, stomping your feet and screaming like a child are good looks
before the All-Powerful Creator of the Universe.

We know two other things: God has good plans for us, even if we can't
see them, and God has never broken a promise He has made, ever.

God has promised that He will destroy evil, **in His time, not ours.**
Humanity has absolutely zero patience. God *will* destroy evil, and
every knee *will* bow, and every tongue *will* confess that Jesus is
Lord on that day, when everyone sees God destroy evil.

But good luck to those who did so unwillingly.
