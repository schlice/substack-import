I see the logical fallacy.

In one respect, we treat the fetus as a person, with rights against
being harmed or killed. In the other, we treat the fetus as a collection
of cells, the fate of which can be arbitrarily determined by the mother.
So in one sense, the fetus has rights, and in another sense, the fetus
does not.

The question is not about the rights of the mother. Those rights never
change. *Roe* supporters, please stop now, save your digital breath.
This has nothing to do with the ability of a woman to determine what
happens with her body. The question is about legitimizing the fetus as a
person simply because it is "wanted" or it is "not wanted." If it is
"not wanted," it is a collection of cells. If it is "wanted," it is a
person with rights which need to be protected. You can't have it both
ways. The fetus is either a person or it is not. We need to have an
objective standard to determine that the fetus is or is not a person in
order to create law which can be equally applied. The feelings of the
mother cannot change the personhood status of the fetus.

Eventually, this will be challenged when someone is charged under this
statute, and they will say that the personhood clause is
unconstitutional because of *Roe*. If the mother can destroy the fetus
at will, it does not have any rights, and therefore cannot be protected
under the law. Indeed, scholars have wondered if the definition of a
person in section (d) of the Unborn Victims of Violence Act will trigger
the "collapse clause" in *Roe* by establishing what the decision said
must be established in order for legal abortion to end. (For those who
don't know, section (d) defines all unborn babies as "members of the
species homo sapiens").

The "collapse clause" in *Roe* reads (**emphasis** mine):

> The appellee and certain amici argue that the fetus is a \'person\'
> within the language and meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. In
> support of this, they outline at length and in detail the well-known

> 113, 157\] for the fetus\' right to life would then be guaranteed
> specifically by the Amendment.** The appellant conceded as much on

I think the Unborn Victims of Violence Act tipifies why *Roe* is bad
law.

Again, *Roe* supporters, this doesn't mean that I believe a woman
shouldn't have the right to choose what happens to her body. I simply
assert that the legal basis on which *Roe* was decided was terrible.
They could have done much better by defining an objective standard at
which a fetus becomes a person (i.e. brain activity, heartbeat, etc) and
make that the "cut-off" point after which abortion can only be performed
if it is deemed to be medically necessary to preserve the life of the
mother. Before that point, elective abortions and abortion-on-demand is
legal. Defining a point at which "life" begins separates when the fetus
is a fetus and when it is a person. Then, both decisions can live
together.

You actually don't need to re-argue *Roe* for that to happen. Just pass
a "smart" personhood amendment which says that life begins at the first
sign of brain activity, or at the point at which the fetus can survive
outside the womb, or whatever they decide. It would also supply a legal
definition to state that the phrase "the unborn" used anywhere does not
apply to a fetus. Then *Roe* would collapse when the fetus becomes a
person, and the Unborn Victims of Violence Act would attach at that
point as well, but not before, as it only attaches to the unborn, and a
fetus is specifically excluded from the category of "unborn."

Now all we have to do is define when a fetus becomes a person. Yeah,
simple...
