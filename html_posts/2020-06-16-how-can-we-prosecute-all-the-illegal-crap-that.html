**How can we prosecute all the illegal crap that\'s been going on under
Trump if we get an honest new PRESIDENT?**

So long as you're talking about after Trump is out of office, you find a
US Attorney in Federal district court (preferably the Southern District
of New York, since they've got an ax to grind), give him the facts, and
let him bring charges if he has sufficient standing to do so. Once Trump
is no longer president, he can be prosecuted for any criminal activity
he may have committed while president.

But good luck finding any actual crimes with enough evidence to make a
solid case, and good luck making them stick.

And hopefully you've got *lots of money*, because Trump will have the
best attorneys money can buy. The [[Dream

to any legal defense Trump could mount.
