**Can someone hack my phone through my Gmail if it is opened on my
phone?**

**YES!!! If your Gmail account is open and accessible on your phone (and
someone has access to it on your phone), they can reset ANYTHING!!!**

Your Gmail account (if it is your primary email) is your **skeleton
key** to every other account you own, and not just your phone. It's your
bank accounts, your work accounts, your school accounts, your doctor's
office account, *literally everything*.

How? If I have access to your Gmail account, *I can reset any of your
passwords.*

PROTECT YOUR GMAIL ACCOUNT! If you don't have *two-factor
authentication* turned on, do it. In fact, stop reading this answer and
go enable it now. If you don't know how, seriously go look it up and
enable it.

Then if your Gmail is logged in to your phone, add a passcode to your
phone. Set your phone to auto-lock after a certain time. Never leave
your phone unattended.

That's the quickest way to ruin your life in a big hurry.

Let's assume you're thinking, "Can they hack my phone *just because
Gmail is logged in on my phone?*" If that's the question you're asking,
then no, just because Gmail is logged in on your phone doesn't mean your
phone can be hacked.

Someone has to be able to access your Gmail before your phone can be
hacked. But if you have an Android phone, there is a lot you can do
through your Google account to mess with your phone. So maybe not
"hack," but how about "remote wipe?" That's no fun either.
