In criminal cases, you are allowed to "plead the Fifth" and your silence
cannot be used against you. In civil cases however, such as divorce
cases or cases over orders of protection, you can still claim your Fifth
Amendment right if necessary, but the judge or the jury is allowed to
assume that by "pleading the Fifth," your answer would have been bad for
you. This is called an *adverse inference*.

So while pleading the Fifth doesn't necessarily mean that you are
guilty, and doing so never amounts to an admission of guilt, in civil
cases, pleading the Fifth creates an adverse inference, which may not
help your case.
