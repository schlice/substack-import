*Note: US-based answer. Other nations are different*

Not at all.

If the entire police force *en masse* decided to quit, the Governor
would call in the National Guard to take their place.

If the fully-constituted forces of the National Guard could not keep the
peace, the Governor would appeal to the President to invoke the
***only*** exception to the *Posse Comitatus Act* and the *Insurrection
Act* and activate the US Military to assist the National Guard.

The peace *will* be kept, one way or another.
