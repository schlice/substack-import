The short answer is **yes**, that's the whole purpose of the toleration
clause. Essentially, it means you know of an honor violation, you've
already addressed the cadet, and the issue was not resolved to your
satisfaction.

Once you've reported the incident, your job is done, and you're not in
violation of tolerating an honor violation. Whether or not an honor team
decides to bring an honor incident forward is not your concern. Once you
have reported, you're done.

The toleration clause is important to both the accused and to the
tolerator. If you go in front of an honor board and someone else knew
about it, they go down for tolerating, so it's in their best interest to
deal with you first rather than dealing with their own honor board
later.
