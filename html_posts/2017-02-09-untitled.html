Several things in your comment differ from the question:

1.  High-speed chase. In a chase, the officers do not expect the vehicle
    to stop, so officers are not generally looking for that. They expect
    the motorcycle to gain some distance (using the aforementioned
    acceleration) and for the driver to bail. They're not expecting him
    to stop, and they're certainly not expecting him to stop hard.
2.  Better braking. A motorcycle can definitely stop in a much shorter
    distance than a car.
