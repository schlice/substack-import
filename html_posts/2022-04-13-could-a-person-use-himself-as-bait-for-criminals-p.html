The problem here is that you *planned* on baiting criminals and then
*planned* on killing them, *planning* on citing self-defense as an
excuse.

All of this *planning* is what is commonly referred to as
**premeditation*,*** and it is one of the things needed to support a
murder charge.

So what's likely in this scenario is that you would be arrested and
charged with murder.

Sometimes, police do this in what is known as a "sting" operation. So if
you really want to do this, work with your local police department.
Otherwise, you risk being arrested yourself.
