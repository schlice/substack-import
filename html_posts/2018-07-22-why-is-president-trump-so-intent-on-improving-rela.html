**Why is President Trump so intent on improving relations with Russia?**

*\[PLEASE NOTE: This answer was written during Trump's first term, but
it seems to have aged very well, into his second term.\]*

There are a lot of answers here
[[Judy](https://www.quora.com/profile/Judy-Hulen)]{.qlink_container},
but two quotes seem to stick out for me, and they're not
politically-charged quotes (i.e. apply more to one side than the other).
They're more life lessons that seem to fit well here:

*"Keep your friends close, but keep your enemies closer."*

and

*"The enemy of my enemy is my friend."*

We spend a lot of time talking about Russia, but the biggest threat to
the United States right now is **China**. I'm FAR more worried about a
Chinese invasion than I am about a Russian invasion. China has made
billions of dollars through special economic zones such as exists today
in Shenzen, incentivizing companies to come in and manufacture goods for
far cheaper than they could do at home. In the process, China has been
stealing the very same intellectual property (IP) and creating virtual
copy knock-offs and has made billions more. Through the injection of
other companies' IP, they have now started developing their own,
non-IP-stealing tech that rivals some of ours in terms of actual build
quality and design. It doesn't beat it yet, but it rivals it. They've
used that infusion of cash to invest in US businesses and real estate to
the point where they control vast swaths of real estate in major cities.
If they ever called any of those loans, we'd be in some serious hot
water.

If China ever decided to stop being so friendly and start attacking, we
need whatever allies we can get, and a China-Russia alliance *could*
spell the end of the United States. I know it's hard to see that because
we haven't successfully been invaded in, well, ever, but discounting the
possibility simply because it hasn't happened before is a mistake we'll
only make once. That's because we'll only have the opportunity to make
it once, and from then on, we'll be Annex 8 to China and we'll all be
learning Mandarin in school instead of English.

Making sure that Russia remains *our* ally and not China's ally takes a
lot of work over a long period of time. President Trump realizes that
being allies with Russia only benefits the United States.
