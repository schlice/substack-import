Herein lies the problem. You\'re never going to know that there is a
medical emergency, because the flight deck is locked from the inside.
Nobody is ever going to know that there is a medical emergency on the
flight deck, if both the pilot and the co-pilot are incapacitated. By
the time the rest of the flight crew realizes that there is a medical
emergency on the flight deck, the plane has already crashed.

This is why we have both a pilot and a co-pilot. Bear in mind, the
co-pilot is fully certified and capable of flying the aircraft all by
himself. The only thing he lacks is the hours needed to be considered a
pilot.

Take, for example, the Lufthansa plane which recently had a mid-air
medical issue on the flight deck. The pilot stepped out of the flight
deck to go to the washroom, and while he was there, the co-pilot passed
out. The pilot tried to regain access to the flight deck by calling the
co-pilot, and when that failed, the pilot entered the emergency override
code on the keypad outside of the flight deck door. At that time, the
copilot regained consciousness. The co-pilot was diagnosed with a
neurological condition and lost his pilot\'s license.

But the likelihood of both the pilot and the co-pilot suffering medical
emergencies at exactly the same time? Not very likely.

So do we really want to make it easier for average passengers to land a
commercial jumbo jet? No, that\'s an expenditure that really doesn\'t
pay dividends. We already have sufficient "two in the box\" redundancy
on the flight deck.

This is a solution in search of a problem.
