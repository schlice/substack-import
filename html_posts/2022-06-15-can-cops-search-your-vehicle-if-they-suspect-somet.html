The answer is *maybe*. And it depends on what you mean by "suspect." Why
do they suspect something illegal is in it? Their suspicion must amount
to what we call "probable cause."

When it comes to anything besides cars, probable cause must be the basis
for obtaining a search warrant. But there is an exception for cars. The
police can search your car without a warrant if they have probable cause
to believe that evidence or contraband is in the vehicle. Cars are
excepted because there is "a lower expectation of privacy because of the
regulations under which they operate. Also, the ease of mobility creates
an inherent exigency to prevent the removal of evidence and
contraband."[\[1\]](#SlscF){#cite-SlscF .citation_link}

However, and any time a police officer wants to search a car, he must
have **probable cause**. Probable cause is "a reasonable amount of
suspicion, supported by circumstances sufficiently strong to justify a
prudent and cautious person\'s belief that certain facts are probably
true\"[\[2\]](#PYYrA){#cite-PYYrA .citation_link}

So **if a police officer** **orders you to get out of the car so they
can search**, allow them to do so and then tell your lawyer.

**But if a police officer** ***asks*** **if he can search your vehicle,
he does not have probable cause.** If he had probable cause, he'd yank
you out of the car and search it. If he's asking you for permission, he
does not have probable cause. You can politely tell him to go pound sand
and to get a warrant.
