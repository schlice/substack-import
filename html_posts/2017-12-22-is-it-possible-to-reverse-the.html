**Is it possible to reverse the \"Trump\" tax debacle when the Democrats
come into power in 2018 and 2020?**

The pleading in your question which states "when" the Democrats come
into power in 2018 and 2020 did not go unnoticed.

So let's assume what you *really* meant to ask was "Hypothetically, if
the Democrats retake both Houses of Congress in 2018, and the Presidency
in 2020, can these tax cuts be reversed?" Since you're asking about the
tax cuts themselves and not whether or not Democrats have a chance at
re-taking Congress or the White House, we will focus exclusively on
that. If you're curious, there have already been numerous askers who
have asked about whether or not the Democrats can re-take Congress and
the White House in 2018 and 2020 respectively.

The answer to your (revised) question is that while it is physically
possible to pass another bill that restores taxes to the way they were
in 2017, **history tells us that when Republicans pass tax cuts, even if
Democrats rail against them, they rarely repeal them.**

The last time Republicans got a tax cut passed was in 2003, and
Democrats complained about it for years. But when the cuts were set to
expire in 2010, Obama, even though he claimed that those tax cuts hurt
the deficit and that it was a huge problem, cut a deal to extend them
for two years. Then in 2012, he cut another deal which made most of the
tax cuts permanent and only raised taxes on those who made more than
\$400,000.

So while Democrats *en bloc* voted against the tax bill, and will likely
try to use it as political fodder for the foreseeable future, it's
unlikely that they will repeal it.
