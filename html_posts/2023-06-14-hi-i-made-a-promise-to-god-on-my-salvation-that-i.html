Woody Allen once said, "If you want to make God laugh, tell Him about
your plans."

Said in another way, *you* told *God* that you planned on not sinning?
Yeah, I'm betting He laughed when you said that.

When you made your promise, did God say, "Okay, I'll hold you to your
promise"? I'm betting He didn't. **Because He's going to fulfill**
***His*** **plans in your life, not** ***yours*.** God knows that you're
a sinner. I know that you're a sinner. I'm a sinner. We all are. We all
are human, and we all fall short of God's glory.

The beauty of this arrangement is that God has forgiven us for our sin.
Accepting Him as our savior, and **repenting** of our sin (turning away)
is all that He requires.

When you "broke your promise," did you do it willingly? Did you say, "I
know I made a promise to God, but I don't care, I'm going to do what I
want anyway"? Because if that's what you did, you might want to question
your actions. It might also lead others to question whether or not
you're actually saved *at all,* **because this is not what a saved
person does.**

No, you probably unintentionally broke your promise, because you are a
sinner, just like all of us are. On occasion, our humanity wins out and
we unwillingly sin. We can't help it sometimes, regardless of how
willing we are to avoid sin.

With that understanding, let's answer the next question:

> Will he take away my salvation? Did I lose eternal life?

No. **Once saved, always saved**. You cannot "lose" your salvation by
doing something.

- Believers believe in a process called *regeneration*. Back in the day,
  we were called "Born-Again" Christians, but the process is the same
  (cf John 3:3, Titus 3:5). Believers are "born again" (or regenerated)
  when they accept Christ. In order to lose salvation then, they would
  have to be "un-regenerated" and there is no indication in the Bible
  that such a thing exists.
- The Holy Spirit indwells all believers (cf John 14:17, Romans 8:9) and
  baptizes all believers into the Body of Christ (cf 1 Corinthians
  12:13). In order to lose salvation, they would have to be
  \"un-indwelt\" and detached from the Body of Christ, and there is no
  indication in the Bible that such a thing exists.
- John 3:15 says that whoever believes in Jesus Christ will \"have
  **eternal** life.\" But if you believe in Christ today (and thus have
  eternal life) but you can lose it tomorrow, then it was never
  \"eternal\" in the first place. Therefore, if you can lose your
  salvation, the promises of eternal life in the Bible would be in
  error.
- Along with that, if you are "saved" but then you "lose your
  salvation," you were never "saved" in the first place.
