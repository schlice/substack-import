**Will Trump now support abortion since he was cured by a cocktail of
antibodies developed from the cells of aborted fetuses?**

No.

And the statement "he was cured by a cocktail of antibodies developed
from the cells of aborted fetuses" is only slightly inaccurate.

So that you don't think the technical explanation is something I made
up, I'll quote it directly from MIT Technology Review:

The Trump administration has sought to block funding of research which
uses newly-acquired tissue from ***recently-performed abortions***, not
old tissue from abortions decades ago. The goal in blocking such
research is to prevent the creation of a fetus-acquisition supply chain
in which women get pregnant and abort their babies in order to earn
money when selling the aborted fetal tissue to laboratories who use the
tissue in medical research.

Because these materials were harvested so long ago, the medical
community claims that the tissues used to test Trump's treatments have
been reproducing in the lab for so many decades, that they transcend the
abortion debate and are no longer thought of as part of abortion
politics.

The discussion is a lot more nuanced than a simple "abortion helped
Trump, Trump loves abortion." That's way too ham-handed of an analysis
to be even remotely workable. The truth is far more nuanced than that.
