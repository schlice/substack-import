**Content:** [If you can find the person, you can file a copyright
infringement lawsuit against him/her. You won\'t likely be sending
anyone to jail, but you\'ll be compensated for the use of your images
(since you say that the thief is using your photos for commercial gain),
as well as receiving damages.\

I suggest you retain the services of an IP attorney.]{.rendered_qtext}
