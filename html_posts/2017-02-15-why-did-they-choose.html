**Content:** []{.rendered_qtext}

Think about the preamble:

*"We, the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect
union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the
common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of
liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this
Constitution for the United States of America."*

The first three words indicate who is authoring this document. It
indicates where the power in this new nation is vested. It doesn't say,
"We, the new government" and it doesn't say, "We, the executive branch."
It says "We, the people." "We the people" are the foundation of the new
country. We the people are the source of the authority vested in
government. Government serves "we the people," not the other way around.

It is because we the people are at the foundation of this new country
that they began the Constitution with "we the people."
