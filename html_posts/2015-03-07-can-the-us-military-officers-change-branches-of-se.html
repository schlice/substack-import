**Content:** [Almost everything that [[David
Rishel](https://www.quora.com/profile/David-Rishel)]{.qlink_container}
said was absolutely correct, except that officers will retain their
ranks upon changing services. Each branch of the service has programs in
place for personnel to do so, and each program is different, depending
on the from/to branches, and whether or not the person is officer or
enlisted.\
\
For example, to answer your specific question, there has been in place
for quite some time \"[[Operation Blue to
Green](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5e59fe&url=http://www.goarmy.com/careers-and-jobs/current-and-prior-service/continue-serving/transitioning-services/blue-to-green.html){.external_link

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="goarmy.com"}]{.qlink_container}\" which allows Air Force and
Navy officers and enlisted personnel to transfer their eligible
commissions or grade to the Army. I recall as I was leaving the Air
Force Reserves that such a program existed, and that was nearly 10 years
ago, so I know this program has existed for some time. Officers will
retain their rank, and they will either directly enter a MOS that
matches their AFSC or Rate, or will receive MOS-specific retraining to
enter a new MOS.\
\
The Air Force has a similar program, allowing officers to perform
\"interservice transfer,\" but not for enlisted personnel. There is a
Prior Service enlistment program that allows eligible Prior Service
enlisteds to transfer into the Air Force. They may not be able to retain
their exact rank, it is different for each person.]{.rendered_qtext}
