No, the HOA cannot arrest you. And the things that will cause you
trouble in an HOA are unlikely to be things that send you to jail.

At worst, your house can be foreclosed on by the HOA. I suppose if you
refuse to vacate your house after foreclosure, you could be arrested,
but the HOA is not "sending you to jail." The HOA merely foreclosed on
the house, and you refused to leave.
