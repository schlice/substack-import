NORAD does not have a "secret mission." [[NORAD's
website](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2b65ac&url=http://www.norad.mil/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="norad.mil"}]{.qlink_container} spells out pretty clearly
what they do.

There were also a number of TV documentaries, like this one...

or [[this
one](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c30842&url=http://www.history.com/shows/modern-marvels/season-3/episode-9){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="history.com"}]{.qlink_container} which detail the history,
construction, and modern use of the facility.

The only big difference which none of the TV shows captured: in 2006,
primary day-to-day operations were moved from NORAD to nearby Peterson
AFB, where the NORAD Headquarters building sits. The correlation center
comm lines and data processing are still performed within the Mountain,
and the facility remains active with a skeleton crew as well as comm,
facilities, and technical support personnel, and sits ready as an
alternate facility.
