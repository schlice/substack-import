**Content:** [In the military, the \"ready position\" is thumb break
open, hand on the backstrap. Military police remove their weapons from
their holsters for one of two reasons: to clear it and give it back to
the armorer, or to fire it. Otherwise, the weapon never leaves the
holster. Research upon which the military relies tells them that an
officer can draw and shoot fast enough for situations which require you
to shoot, and leaving the weapon in the holster as a matter of policy
prevents accidental discharge because some airman who is bored to tears
in a remote guard shack decides to play \"quick draw.\"\
\
Note that this policy works for the military. This policy would
**never** work outside the gate.]{.rendered_qtext}
