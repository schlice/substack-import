**Content:** [A low-grade fever is definitely an uncommon symptom. Most
people taking beta-blockers (Avonex, Betaseron, Rebif, etc) will feel
flu-like symptoms after injecting their medication, but a low-grade
fever during periods of fatigue is a new one on me. I am certain it\'s
related, but exactly how, I can\'t say.]{.rendered_qtext}
