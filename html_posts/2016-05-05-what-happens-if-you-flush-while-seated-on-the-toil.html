Correct answer: nothing.

- The seat does not make a perfect seal. Even when you remove the shroud
  around the seat, you still can\'t get it to make a perfect seal.
- A properly working vacuum toilet only creates suction for a few
  seconds.
- The amount of suction it produces, 21 kPa or 3 psi, is not at all
  difficult for the human body to overcome.

So in an extraordinary and implausible set of circumstances (the seat
somehow makes a perfect seal with your butt, the vacuum pump fails and
produces 30 psi instead of 3, and the vacuum pump somehow gets stuck in
the on position), it is conceivable that you could be stuck to the seat.
But with modern vacuum toilets in good working order, nothing at all
will happen.
