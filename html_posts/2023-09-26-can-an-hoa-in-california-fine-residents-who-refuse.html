If the HOA has within its Governing Documents the requirement to have an
EV charger on your home, then they can issue fines for failing to follow
that provision.

But if they arbitrarily decreed that all homes must have an EV charger
installed, and there is nothing in their Governing Documents that
permits them to make such a decree, they may not have the authority to
do so.

You should consult with a real estate attorney in your area who
specializes in HOAs to find out if this is legal.
