**Is it legal to issue my DL a red light camera violation if the car was
never stopped by an officer?**

It depends on the state and the rules for how a ticket is "served" to
the registered owner of the vehicle.

We use red light cameras in some cities in Colorado. It's not actually a
recorded violation until you are served. Here, you can be served in a
number of ways:

- Being handed a ticket by a peace officer
- Being handed a ticket by a process server, or the process server
  delivering the ticket to someone over 18 at the residence of the
  registered owner
- Being delivered the ticket via registered mail, return receipt
  requested

We have reports of the city sending process servers to residences at 6
AM to try to catch people at home, so Colorado residents should be aware
of this.

Once the ticket is issued, it has 90 days to be served by one of the
above methods, or it is invalid. If it is not served within 90 days, the
violation expires.

Also note that a red light camera violation is civil, not criminal. It
will never add points to your license. If you are properly served and
you don't pay, they will send the ticket to a collection agency which
could negatively impact your credit.
