**Can an apartment leasing company in Texas send you a text message to
advise you of an eviction?**

Usually, while the text message may be a convenience, it is not
considered legal notification of eviction. I'm unaware of any
jurisdiction where text message is the only form of notification
required to process an eviction.

The eviction notice will be attached to the door of the unit, such that
you cannot enter the unit without seeing the notice. It will be attached
in such a way that you will have to remove it to enter the unit.
