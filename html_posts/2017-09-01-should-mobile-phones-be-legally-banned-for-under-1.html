So let's answer the question: **should** mobiles be banned for people
under age 18?

In order to answer that question, we have to determine if there is any
appreciable harm caused by mobile phones to people under 18.

You would also have to determine if there are any *benefits* provided by
mobile phones to people under 18.

If the harm outweighs the benefits, then maybe you have something there.
Maybe you can convince your lawmakers in your state to make it illegal
to possess mobile phones by those under 18.

But as with most things for people under 18, it is normally left up to
their **parents** to determine what is in their best interest. The only
time that this is not true is if something is detrimental to the public
at large, or it is so inherently dangerous that *even parents* should
not be allowed to approve their U18s to possess or use it.

So I think that passing a law is probably not the way to go, as there
are definitely benefits provided by mobile phones (as many of my
colleagues here have already answered). Therefore, it is probably in
everyone's best interest to keep allowing parents to make those
decisions.

However, you might think instead of mounting a public service campaign
to inform parents about the dangers of teen mobile phone use. Note that
you'll probably get a lot of pushback from the mobile phone industry,
which will release counter campaigns to show just how beneficial a phone
in the hands of a teen can be. I bet their ads will include the rape
scenario thwarted by a mobile phone. Heck, my phone even has an SOS
feature (if I enable it) that allows me to click the power button three
times in rapid succession and send a text message to 911 with my
location.

I think you'll have a difficult time getting any traction on your
proposal.
