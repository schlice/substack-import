**How does the media conclude that banning guns is the answer, while
ignoring the massive disparities in health care and minimum wage between
nations they claim are a success and the USA?**

The media has been corrupted. They no longer deliver the news. They
deliver *opinion*, thinly disguised as journalism (in some cases, there
is no attempt at thin disguises even made). This is true regardless of
what side of the aisle you fall on (either all the mainstreams and CNN
on the left, or Fox News and conservative talk radio on the right).
Finding actual journalism usually means coalescing various sources of
"news" and forming your own opinion about what really happened. Actual
journalism is difficult to find anywhere.

Therefore, the media concluded that banning guns is the answer for two
reasons:

1.  It's the platform position of the political left
2.  It gets more eyeballs on their screens for longer than discussing
    actual statistics and disparities in mental health care and minimum
    wages around the world. It's inflammatory.

Mainstream media is hemorrhaging viewers daily. They know it. But
they've fully thrown in with the left; they're in the tank for all
things Liberal. They can't back out now and start practicing "real"
journalism, or the scant few viewers they have left will abandon them.
As far as viewership, they simply have decided to do more with less by
hanging on to that position for dear life.

With the internet gaining prominence over broadcast television for the
delivery of news and entertainment, it probably doesn't matter much
anymore. "Mainstream" media is on its last legs.

We're witnessing the death throes of an industry. They won't be able to
re-tool themselves in time; they can't make the elephant dance. This is
their final opus.
