The answer is **hypocrisy.** Let me give you an example of similar
hypocrisy that explains the difference.

In 2011, 8583 people died from handgun-related violence. That\'s a big
number, certainly nothing to dismiss. But in the same year, the number
of people who died from \"alcohol-related death, not attributed to
accident or homicide\" was over 25,000.

To put this in perspective, over **three times** the number of people
were killed by alcohol-related illness (not accidents or homicides) than
were killed by guns. Add in the number killed in alcohol-related car
accidents (14,000), and the likelihood that at least half of those
deaths from handgun-related violence were probably fueled by alcohol,
and you find that it\'s likely that over 40,000 deaths were in some way
related to the consumption of alcohol. Why are we spending our time
worrying about guns (which, by the way, are protected by the
Constitution) when alcohol destroys far more lives than guns ever could?

How many kids go to sleep at night not terrified that they will
accidentally be shot, but terrified that a parent on a drunken bender
will decide to take out his or her frustrations on that child\'s face?
How many kids live in abject fear of what adults who use alcohol will do
next? The number of kids killed by violent or haphazard parents \--
their actions magnified by alcohol abuse \-- is orders of magnitude
greater than the number of kids killed in freak school shootings, and
their agony lasts far longer.

Alcohol provides no benefits at all. None. Guns at least protect me from
others with guns. But what good does a bottle of whiskey do in
protecting me from a drunk driver? There are no medical benefits to
alcohol. Studies in the late 70s which showed a link between red wine
and heart benefits were never proved, and were likely due to other
lifestyle advantages rather than a consumption of wine. Alcohol is an
*intoxicating* substance, that is, introducing toxins into your body.
Any perceived benefits can\'t be voiced with a straight face: it makes
ugly people pretty, annoying people tolerable, and at best, helps you
have a really good time that you\'ll barely remember. At worst, it will
provide you with \"liquid courage,\" removing your inhibitions (which
keep you safe), allowing you to do something foolhardy which will get
you hurt or killed.

Considering the fact that alcohol kills far more people than guns, and
provides no real benefits at all, why do we waste our time arguing to
ban guns, when logically we should first be banning alcohol? Because we
tried it before? Yes, Prohibition was an abject failure, and the people
attempting to ban guns fail to realize that a ban on guns would do
**exactly the same thing**: spur crime of all kinds (not just organized
crime) and enhance and reinforce the black market trade in guns. There
are over 300 million guns in this country; you can\'t hope to remove
them all simply by changing a law. Prime example: the \"War on Drugs.\"
We made it illegal. Did we actually stop people from getting it? Nope,
we just emboldened criminals and created a massive black market which
essentially funds the entire GDP of Mexico.

More importantly, if you have one of two things to ban, wouldn\'t you
ban the one that has absolutely no benefit whatsoever, contributes
nothing to society, and causes nothing but misery and pain? Wouldn\'t
you ban the one that is demonstrably more harmful? Especially when the
less-harmful one is protected by the Constitution?

I don\'t personally advocate for a ban on alcohol. I just point out the
hypocrisy of those who use statistics like the President did in his SOTU
address last night as a call to ban guns, when there are things that are
far more harmful and far less useful that no one is even thinking about
banning. The utter hypocrisy is palpable.
