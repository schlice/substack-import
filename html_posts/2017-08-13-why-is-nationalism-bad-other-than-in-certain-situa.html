I've answered this a few times already, but you're conflating two terms
which are actually very different: **patriotism** and **nationalism.**

*Patriotism* is a love of country. Patriotism is necessary because to be
proud of one's country is the basis for independence.

*Nationalism*, on the other hand, is patriotism run amok. Nationalism
stems from a belief that your system is not *better* than other systems,
but is *superior* to other systems, and deserves to be *forcibly
exported* to the rest of the world.

Patriotism causes freedom; nationalism causes wars.
