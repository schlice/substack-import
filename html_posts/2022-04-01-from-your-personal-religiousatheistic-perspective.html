So you removed "religion" from the question, but it was asked in the
"Christians and Christianity" forum. So even though I answer Christian
questions and am a creationist and not an evolutionist, I'll do my best
to answer the question from a non-religious perspective.

The problem for evolutionists is not so much explaining how all life
forms are related (even though this still has some serious issues). The
big problem with macroevolution as the source of human life is the
**first life**.

Evolutionists, as well as creationists, tend to speak as if they know
how the first life came into existence. Both cannot be right; either the
first life was created by some kind of intelligence, or it arose
spontaneously from nonliving chemicals. But the truth is that *no one
was there to see the creation of the first life, so no one knows for
sure.*

So the \$64,000 question is: ***how can we tell?*** What scientific
principles can we use to help us understand what caused the first life?

***Forensics***.

The central principle in forensic science is the [[Principle of
Uniformity](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=34723a&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniformitarianism){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}. It basically says that
causes in the past are the same as causes today. In other words, we
assume that the world worked the same in the past as it does today. If a
message requires intelligence to produce today, then a message in the
past also required intelligence to produce.

For example, look at the Grand Canyon. Was anyone around to see it being
formed? No, but we know from the Principle of Uniformity that water
erosion can cause canyons, because we see it happen today. Compare that
with Mount Rushmore. What caused that? No one would ever suggest that
natural forces caused presidents' faces to appear in rocks. Since we
have never observed natural laws carving faces in rocks today, we can
presume that natural laws have never done so in the past either.
Therefore, we conclude that intelligent creatures (sculptors) carved the
faces in the rocks.

In the same way, when we look at the first single-celled life, we can
presume that natural forces did not create the DNA which contains the
equivalent of 1,000 encyclopedias of specific messages. Natural laws
have never been known to create even simple messages today, much less a
message 1,000 encyclopedias long.

So why do evolutionists still tell us that the first life spontaneously
generated from nonliving chemicals? Nonliving chemicals have never
produced life today, and we cannot *apply intelligence* to make them do
so. Spontaneous generation of life has never been observed. What we have
observed is that all life arises only from similar existing life. And
even if they could create life in the lab, it would prove creation,
because it would prove that it takes *a lot of intelligence* to create
life.

**TL;DR:** Make sure you're looking at the correct question. The
question isn't whether or not evolution could have occured. The question
is how the first life came to be.

From your personal perspective, what are your thoughts on the evolution
