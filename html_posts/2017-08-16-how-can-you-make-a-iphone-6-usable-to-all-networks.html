You can't.

Mobile phones will only work on the networks for which they contain
radios. They will typically only work on certain networks so that they
don't have to cram in unneeded radios. So for example, phones which work
on the Verizon network (CDMA) will not work on the AT&T or T-Mobile
(GSM) network. It's because the radios work at different frequencies and
use different network technologies.
