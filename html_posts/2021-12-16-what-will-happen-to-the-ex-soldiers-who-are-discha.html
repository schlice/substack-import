The same thing will happen to them as will happen to any person who
refuses a direct order.

Mandatory vaccination has existed in the military for many years. No one
in the military has ever been under any disillusion that they were
somehow immune to this. They are free to *disagree* with the
vaccination, but they are not free to *refuse a direct order* to be
vaccinated.

If their discharge is anything other than honorable, they will face
consequences throughout the remainder of their life, especially as they
try to find gainful employment. This may drive them towards
less-than-ethical lines of work, or may encourage them to become
radicalized and join militia groups.
