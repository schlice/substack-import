**Content:** [No, the logic doesn\'t follow.\
\
Republicans claim that Democrats who vote **against** tax **cuts** are
voting **for** tax **increases**.\
\
The logical corrollary for gun control laws would be that Democrats can
claim that Republicans who vote **against** gun **control** are actually
voting **for** gun **rights**. They could then claim that Republicans
are voting to support the rights of mass shooters.\
\
But they would then have to prove that mass shooters acquired their guns
legally, following all the laws that Republicans voted to enact.\
\
Conflating Republicans with accomplices to mass murder is a logical leap
which is invalid.]{.rendered_qtext}
