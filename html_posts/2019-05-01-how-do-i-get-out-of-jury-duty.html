**How is one to get out of jury duty legally?**

Before we get started, let's be clear. If you have a driver's license,
you can be selected for jury duty. Jury duty is one of your civic
responsibilities. That means, if you're a citizen, it's one of your
responsibilities to participate in the justice system.

Here's the important point to remember: Don't forget **the Golden
Rule**. If you'd want a jury of your peers should you end up behind the
defendant's table, then you have to do your part and serve as a "peer"
for someone else. The system only works when we all participate.

OK, now that the duty part is out of the way, how do you legally get out
of jury duty? There are a few methods you can use.

1.  **Get a doctor's note.** I'm not telling you to lie, but some
    medical conditions are disqualifying for jury duty. Check with the
    county or city where you've been summoned and see what is a
    disqualifying condition. If you have one of those conditions, you
    may not need to serve.
2.  **Go back to school.** In some cities, full-time students don't need
    to serve on a jury. But make sure this is an exemption where you
    live before you start enrolling in college courses just to get out
    of jury duty.
3.  **Plead hardship.** While you do receive a stipend for sitting on a
    jury, it's not your usual paycheck. If you're the sole provider in
    your household and you get paid hourly, the stipend may not cover
    your family's needs, and you can rightly claim a hardship because
    you'd be unable to work.
4.  **Request a postponement**. You can legally request to postpone your
    duty until another time. Generally, there is a limit to the number
    of postponements you can request in a single calendar year, but if
    it's simply inconvenient to be on a jury at your scheduled time (or
    you actually have a conflict, like travel you've already arranged,
    or a function you can't miss, like a wedding), you can request to
    postpone your service.
5.  **Be honest during jury selection.** If you can't be impartial, or
    if you hate cops, or whatever might make you a bad choice for a
    juror, make sure you tell them. Being honest is important. If you
    truly can't be an impartial juror, you'll naturally be removed.

In summary, *try* to attend jury duty if you can. But if you can't, this
may help. Check the website for the jurisdiction in which you're
scheduled to serve. They have listings of all of the disqualifications
for duty. You may meet one or more of those criteria already. Many
jurisdictions even allow you to request an excusal or a postponement
online.
