**Why do religious people (of all faiths), lie about what their
scripture says, when the text is outdated (i.e. when a follower of an
Abrahamic faith, Islam or Christianity for example) says that a murder,
or rape is always forbidden?**

I get where you're coming from.

But what you have to understand is that there are different Greek words
for "killing" and "murder."

In Christianity and in the Christian Bible, rape is not discussed as a
crime. Adultery is considered a crime, as well as murder.

So while killing is sometimes allowed (and sometimes prescribed), murder
is not.
