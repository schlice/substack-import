<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [Wow, you must work for the IRS. You seem to have a lot
invested in our current system of taxes, which is regressive and full of
cheaters and loopholes. It\'s estimated that almost 16% of Americans are
out of compliance with our current system because they unknowingly did
something incorrect when filing taxes.\
\
You can cheat the FairTax system much less easily than you can cheat the
current system. And with fewer taxpayers (businesses only), there\'s
lots more eyes on them, so it\'s much easier to ensure compliance.\
\
I\'m not even going to go into each one of your responses because most
of them are just flat-out wrong or have no facts or say silly things
like let\'s open up our borders. Gah, it\'s like arguing with a two-year
old.]{.rendered_qtext}
