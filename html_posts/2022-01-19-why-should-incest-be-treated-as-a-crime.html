**Incest is treated as a crime because the state has a compelling
interest in protecting children.**

We already know that incest greatly increases the risk of birth defects
in children. The problem with having sex with close relatives is that
there is an astonishingly high chance that the child will be born with
birth defects.

Because the state has a vested interest in ensuring that children have
as great a chance for success as we can give them, preventing children
being born with birth defects is within the state's set of compelling
interests.

Since there is a high correlation between incestuous behavior and birth
defects, incest is outlawed.
