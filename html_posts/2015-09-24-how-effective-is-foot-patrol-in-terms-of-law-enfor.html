**Content:** [Foot patrol is awesome. It allows officers to get out,
know the area that they patrol, interact with citizens, and be \"in
tune\" with the community.\
\
However, foot patrol is *expensive*. It is very manpower-intensive, and
thus requires more officers to cover the same area. And in today\'s
shrinking-department-budget era and increased scrutiny over the cost of
providing police services, departments simply can\'t afford this type of
policing.\
\
This is where I get to shine, because I get to extoll the virtues of
*reserve officers.* Reserve deputies in my department are titled as
\"highly-trained, community-minded volunteers.\" Reserves receive all of
the training that their full-time paid counterparts receive, but they do
so at night and on weekends since they have full-time jobs. Reserves are
fully certified in firearms, vehicle operations, arrest control, and
local and state statutes. They are fully POST-certified as Reserve Peace
Officers, and are sworn as deputies by the Sheriff. They are completely
indstinguishable from their full-time counterparts with the exception of
the \"RESERVE\" rocker above the shoulder patch. Interesting side story,
when the department re-worked the uniforms a few years ago, they asked
the Reserves if they wanted to wear regular shoulder patches as the
\"RESERVE\" rocker is not required by law. The Reserves opted to keep
the rocker. Reserves are volunteers, as I mentioned, and receive only
their training, firearms, Tasers, ballistic vests, and other uniform
accoutrements paid by the department. They pay for everything else,
including all their leathers, out of their own pocket.\
\
Reserves have a proud history, formerly being \"organized\" as the
Sheriff\'s Possee. The formalized Sheriff\'s Reserve is now
fully-supported, well-trained, and legal. The Reserves are highly
motivated, and save the department millions of dollars a year in pay and
operating expenses. Expanded use of reserves could \"fill the gap\"
where departments need to save money on officer deployment.\
\
Our problem is that we simply don\'t have enough of them. We have about
300 sworn officers, and only about 30 of them are Reserves. We just need
more.]{.rendered_qtext}
