Yes. I was on natalizumab for 18 months, and it was the only time in my
MS journey that I had lesions *shrink*. In other words, we were
suppressing MS so well, that my body was beginning to heal itself. As
far as MS goes, Tysabri has one of the highest *efficacies* of any MS
drug.

But you can't really stay on natalizumab (brand name is Tysabri) for too
long. There is a very dangerous risk which comes along with Tysabri. It
is a disease called **progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
(PML)**, which can be fatal. PML is caused by the activation of the [[JC
Virus](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4ede7e&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_polyomavirus_2){.external_link

system normally suppresses the virus, but on Tysabri, that suppression
is weakened. The JC virus can activate, and it can induce PML. This
virus is common; estimates say anywhere between 70 to 90% of the
population has been exposed at some point, likely in childhood or early
adolescence.

While you are on Tysabri, you will routinely be checked for JC. If you
are JC Positive, you can still take Tysabri, but you will have to be
closely monitored. There will be special onboarding and offboarding
procedures so as to avoid having two MS medicines in your bloodstream at
the same time, a major factor in determining whether or not JC will
activate.

I was fortunate in that during my entire treatment with Tysabri, I
remained (and am to this day) JC Negative.
