Firstly, if you ever do think about suicide again, there is help. As
most everyone else said, there is always someone to talk to. Use the
resources at the top of the answer section to contact someone who you
can talk to.

Most folks mentioned that you should talk to your parents, or at lest
try to. The link that [[Gauri
K](https://www.quora.com/profile/Gauri-K-27)]{.qlink_container} posted
is an excellent resource about talking to your parents about depression.

If that doesn't work, try talking to a teacher you trust, or a coach, or
a school counselor. If you have any close friends, you could even try
talking to their parents.

The bottom line: try talking to your parents. Use the resources on that
page to help. If that doesn't work, find someone else you trust to talk
to, but ***please*** talk to someone.

Depression is a vicious circle. It feeds on itself and makes itself
worse. It is a cycle which is very difficult to get out of on your own.
Needing help for depression is not a bad thing, and it doesn't make you
a bad person. You are a better person than most in your situation
because you recognize that you need help, and that's the first step.

Good luck!
