As with any legal question, the answer is "it depends." Laws regarding
video recordings vary from state to state. But realistically, if you
stop and think about it, if she can see the same view of your yard from
that window that she can see from the camera, she's really not seeing
anything more than she would have by just sitting in front of the
window.

If it's a security camera, and she can show that it's looking at things
she is responsible for protecting (even if it also sees stuff in your
yard), this is legal.

What may be actionable is what she intends on doing with any footage she
gets from such a camera. For the most part, these actions are pretty
similar across states.

If she intends to file a lawsuit against you, the video "evidence" she
presents from that camera would not be admissible, as it was obtained by
violating privacy. You have a reasonable expectation of privacy in your
yard, that's why you have a 6 foot privacy fence (they call it a privacy
fence for a reason, btw). Looking over such a fence to gather "evidence"
has already been adjudicated to be an invasion of privacy.

If she tried to make a documentary and get monetary gain from that
documentary, this too would be illegal. Your likeness cannot be used for
commercial gain without your consent.

She could give the footage to the local news, which would be fine. She
could write a scholarly paper at the local university and include stills
from the camera, although they would likely attempt to get some
permission from you before they publish, even though it's technically
legal. She could even publish stills here on Quora, as long as she was
not attempting to acquire any money for her post. Educational uses do
not violate the privacy exceptions. And finally, if she just loves your
yard and keeps any video to herself, this is also not likely to be too
much of a concern either.

Although it is really creepy.
