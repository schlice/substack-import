Have you ever baked a cake?

Usually, the timer goes off, and the cake *appears to be done*. But you
stick a toothpick in it, or a fork, to see if it is done on the inside
(as an aside, that phrase, "stick a fork in it, it's done" came from
this practice).

Or, have you ever grilled a steak?

It can look done on the outside, but depending on what temperature it
was when it started cooking, it is only a meat thermometer (or feeling
it for tenderness) which can tell if the steak is done on the inside.

In other words, something may appear to be done on the outside, when it
still needs time to "cook" on the inside.

The same holds true of believers.

Some people say they are Christians. They go to church regularly. They
read the Bible. They sing the songs. They greet people warmly. *But
inside, they have never truly accepted Christ as their Savior.*

Ultimately, they are "fake Christians."

Scripture indeed talks about those who appear to be good Christians, but
later fall away from their faith. In the parable of the sower and the
seed, some of the seed sprung up quickly, only to wither away or be
choked out by weeds.

> As for what was sown on rocky ground, this is the one who hears the
> word and immediately receives it with joy, yet he has no root in
> himself, but endures for a while, and when tribulation or persecution
> arises on account of the word, immediately he falls away. As for what
> was sown among thorns, this is the one who hears the word, but the
> cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and
> it proves unfruitful --- Matthew 13:20--22 ESV

For some "fake Christians," the heart is still a heart of stone, so the
Word lands and the people sing and worship, but as soon as their life
circumstances change, they fall away from the faith, because that Word
had not taken root. The seed which was choked out is the "fake
Christian" who hears the Word (the seed is planted), but the "cares of
the world and the deceitfulness of riches" cause them to not accept what
they hear. But the seed sown on good soil (when the heart is ready)
brings forth fruit for harvest.

\

Scripture also tells about what happens to a person when they truly
accept Christ into their lives.

> And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within
> you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you
> a heart of flesh. --- Ezekiel 36:26 ESV

This new heart is *incapable of* ***not*** *loving God.*

In other words, **a true believer can** ***never not love God. A true
believer cannot "lose his faith."***

And remember, we didn't do this to ourselves. God called the believer
out of death and into life:

> And you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once walked,
> following the course of this world, following the prince of the power
> of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of
> disobedience---among whom we all once lived in the passions of our
> flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by
> nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. But God, being
> rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, even
> when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with
> Christ---by grace you have been saved --- Ephesians 2:1--5 ESV

One of the top ten great phrases of the Bible is right there: **But
God**. We were **dead** in our sin. Can a dead man save himself? No!
Only God can save him. We were dead, **but God** saved us. Even when we
were dead in our sin, God made us alive. And it is God's grace which did
that.

God removes that dead heart of stone through His grace, and replaces it
with a heart of flesh. He does this when we truly accept Him; we are
**regenerated** (born again).

> Jesus answered him, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born
> again he cannot see the kingdom of God." Nicodemus said to him, "How
> can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his
> mother\'s womb and be born?" Jesus answered, "Truly, truly, I say to
> you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the
> kingdom of God." --- John 3:3--5 ESV

\

So can someone be a "Christian" and not believe? Yes, happens all the
time. This is why we are sometimes confused when someone we thought was
a strong Christian falls away from the faith. They may have *appeared*
"cooked" on the outside, but they were still "raw" in the middle.
