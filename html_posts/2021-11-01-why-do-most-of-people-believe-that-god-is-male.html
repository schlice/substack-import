God is neither male nor female. God does not have a physical form, so he
can be neither male or female.

But we *refer* to God as male because that's how he has chosen to reveal
himself to us.

God refers to himself using several masculine qualities, including
fatherhood, protection, direction, strength, etc. Metaphors used to
describe him in the Bible include: King, Father, Judge, Husband, Master,
and the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Original question:

Why do most of people believe that God is male?
