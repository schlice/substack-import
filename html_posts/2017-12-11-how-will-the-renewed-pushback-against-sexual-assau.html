**Will the renewed pushback against sexual assault hurt Trump in light
of the 16 women who have now stepped forward to name him as their
victimizer?**

It is well known that public figures are targets of malicious lawsuits.
I'm not saying that's what is happening here, but Trump isn't a
politician, he's a public figure (TV star, rich businessman). And
today's climate of "get an accusation and have your life destroyed" puts
way too much emphasis on the victim and not enough protection for the
accused.

*(Before you SJWs get started, I'm glad that women are feeling empowered
enough to step forward and tell their stories. But I'm a law guy; not
only is this exceedingly unfair to the accused, it's going to royally
backfire on women, and that makes it all the more sad)*

So I say let the legal system handle it. It won't hurt Trump in the
slightest. Trump's base won't think any differently about him. Heck, if
the *Access Hollywood* audio tape didn't make a difference in the
election, what difference will this make?
