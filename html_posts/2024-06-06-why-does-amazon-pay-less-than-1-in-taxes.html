First of all, I don't know how much Federal income taxes Amazon pays,
and neither do you. And if you are one of the few people who *does*
actually know how much Federal income tax Amazon pays, you are likely
not authorized to talk about it, and doing so would be a Federal crime.

So let's assume that you use whatever public data you can get your hands
on and you come up with this 1% figure, and let's assume that it is
pretty close. Why this happens could be for a number of reasons:

1.  Amazon could be carrying over net operating losses to the following
    tax year. For example, if you lost \$1M in one year but then made
    \$1M dollars the next year, you would have a net zero operating
    income, and you would pay no taxes.
2.  Amazon pays little taxes despite high income due to their use of
    *restricted stock.* Amazon pays their employees using *restricted
    stock* as part of their total compensation. The tax code allows them
    to deduct the value of the restricted stock on the vesting date of
    that stock. At the same time, employees have to pay taxes on the
    market value of that stock, so the taxes are indeed properly
    accounted for for the full value of that stock. So let's assume
    Amazon grants \$10 billion of stock in 2020, and it vests in 2023
    with a market value of \$30 billion, meaning that the value of the
    stock increased about three times its initial value over that
    three-year period. Amazon gets a *tax deduction* for \$30 billion in
    2023, but only recorded an expense of \$10 billion. As a result, the
    value of the expense is understated, and the "book profits" are
    overstated, by \$20 billion. Book income is artificially high, so
    Amazon looks profitable for financial accounting, because the
    financial accounting does not capture the full economic picture. And
    the bottom line is that *this is all perfectly legal. C*ompensating
    employees is indeed a deductible expense, and just because financial
    accounting does not require the full cost of that compensation to be
    recognized does not mean companies are doing anything wrong.
