<p><em>Sorry, no comments on this one.</em></p>
<p><em>If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is
grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,
downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora
is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply
going to comment to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" then you're
the reason why I disable comments. Well done, Karen. You ruined it for
everyone.</em></p>
