Gays have way better fashion sense than I, and they literally have a
better sense of humor than any straight person I know except for
professional comedians whose job it is to have a great sense of humor. I
feel like they just have way more fun than straight people. The gay men
I know certainly seem like they are much happier than many of the
straight people I know, and while that's certainly anecdotal on my part,
it's my experience.

I absolutely love them. Is that gay? Yeah, it is a little gay. But I'm
okay with that.

Oh, that's not what you were asking? Were you asking how a Christian
views the lifestyle choices of a gay person? That's not specifically
what you asked, though.

As a Christian, I believe that any person's choices (gay or straight or
anything else) are between himself and his God. Which means **I don't
care what they do.**

If they were to *come to me and ask me questions about religion and sin
and salvation*, I'd answer them as best I could. But as far as I can
tell, no gay person is here asking me questions, and as of yet, no gay
person has ever come to me asking religious questions. So I'm not going
to opine about my religious beliefs regarding their lifestyle choices.
Nor am I going to impose my will on them. Nor am I going to give them
any unsolicited religious advice. I'm here if they want to talk, I'm a
ghost if they don't. And I like it that way. Why should it be any
different with a gay person than a straight person who is also a sinner?
News flash: we're all sinners and have all fallen short of God's
standards.

I believe that there will be a reckoning at the time of God's choosing
where He will lay out our actions and will judge us. But again, for me,
that's between me and God and no one else.
