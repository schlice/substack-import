It doesn\'t matter what I think. I don\'t live in Alabama.

The only people for whom Alabama\'s laws should matter are the people
who live in Alabama.

And clearly, the majority of people have voted for elected officials who
believe that no exceptions for rape or incest should be provided.

I\'m sure that not everyone in Alabama believes that there should not be
any exceptions for rape or incest. But enough people do believe it that
they were able to send officials to their state legislature who could
pass such laws.

Clearly, I think you can see that Alabama values life to such a degree
that they believe that the right to life of the baby trumps the right to
bodily autonomy of the mother.

I guess the women of Alabama who are raped will have to take advantage
of their Safe Haven laws. All 50 states have them. And, if you can\'t
have a baby, then clearly Alabama is the state to go, because they\'re
going to have lots of extra babies put up for adoption. That\'s good,
because the amount of people waiting to adopt a baby in the United
States outnumber the amount of babies available for adoption by a factor
of 24 to 1. So it looks like Alabama is going to provide a lot of
healthy babies to families that want to adopt.

I hope that Alabama strengthened their prenatal health care support at
the same time. If I were writing such a strict law, I would make sure
that all pregnant women have the ability to receive full prenatal health
care, at the expense of the state, for their entire pregnancy term. The
vast majority of medical conditions which threaten the life of a
pregnant woman can be mitigated with good prenatal health care.
