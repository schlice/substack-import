**Is NFL players\' ability to take a knee at games a constitutionally
protected right?**

There is a fine line we walk here. The First Amendment only applies to
the government making laws which restrict your right to free speech.
Your employer, on the other hand, can absolutely discipline you for your
speech if they don't like it, up to and including termination if they so
desire.

Of course, it gets a little more dicey if the government *is* your
employer, so there are rules and tests courts use for Federal employees
to determine whether or not their speech is protected.

But in this case, an NFL player is an employee of a private corporation,
and that corporation has the absolute right to determine exactly what
behaviors you will exhibit while you are working for them.

So in summary:

- *Do you have the Constitutional right to take a knee during the
  National Anthem?* ***Yes, you do.***
- *Do you have the right to be free from consequences from your employer
  for exercising your First Amendment rights while on the job?* ***No,
  you do not.***
