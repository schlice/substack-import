**Content:** [It does, actually.\
\
The Constitution also says that there will be no \"tests\" for holding
public office. A \"religion\" test is therefore also a violation of the
Constitution, as well as a violation of the First Amendment.\
\
I would suppose that an atheist would have to apply to run for office,
and then be denied, in order to bring a Constitutional objection to the
law.]{.rendered_qtext}
