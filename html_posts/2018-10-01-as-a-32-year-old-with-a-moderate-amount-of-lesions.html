**As a 32-year-old with a moderate amount of lesions from multiple
sclerosis, do you think there is hope within the next 10 to 15 years of
some type of brain repair?**

When I was first diagnosed, I had well over 20 lesions and only one of
them wasn't a silent lesion. So I fully appreciate your question.

I will answer with two points.

Prolactin, when used with an interferon beta, [[has been
shown](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=fedfd8&url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4367923/){.external_link

properties. But it also is a pro-inflammatory agent, so less ideal for
MS, in which the inflammation of the nerves precipitates most of the
symptoms. Not to mention (and especially important for me), pure
prolactin supplementation has been shown to produce male lactation. Um,
thanks but no thanks? Anyway, some groundbreaking work is ongoing right
now to understand prolactin's role in remyelination and to produce some
results in terms of repairing some of the lesions in the brain.

Secondly, I was on Tysabri for 18 months. It worked *so well*, that my
brain was actually able to repair itself. For the only time in the
history of my disease course, my lesions actually shrank while I was on
Tysabri. That's not anything that Tysabri did other than to shut down
disease process so thoroughly as to allow the brain the opportunity to
heal.

So not only are we very close to having a medication which could
potentially aid in remyelination, we currently have approved MS therapy
drugs that work so well that the body can, in fact, heal itself.

So to answer your question: **yes**, I firmly believe that we will have
some restorative treatments within the next 15 years.
