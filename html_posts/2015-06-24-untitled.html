**Content:** [Police training includes an entire course of study (40
hours minimum in our department before an officer is sworn) called
**Arrest Control**. They are trained on techniques used to physically
restrain suspects and place them under arrest. The goal is to use the
minimum amount of force against a suspect and subdue them safely and in
a way which produces the least amount of injury to the suspect and to
the officer.\
\
Officers are trained on the use of every device or tool on their belts.
In most cases (except the baton and the firearm) they have to have the
device used on them. Every officer who carries a Taser has been hit by a
Taser (the full 15-second ride in my department). Now, they don\'t shoot
the barbs at us; they use a training Taser with electric leads and
alligator clips, but everyone gets to feel what it feels like and the
effect on the body, and the pain. They get to fire the Taser at practice
targets, so they can practice proper barb placement so as to avoid
injury and deliver the maximum effect to the suspect. Everyone who
carries pepper spray has been hit with pepper spray. We do have
paramedics available to help remove the oil from the skin, but we still
get hit with it and get to feel what it feels like on the
skin.]{.rendered_qtext}
