**I keep getting mail for someone that does not live in my home. I have
written \"return to sender\" on every mail piece but a lot of the
companies just resend the mail. Is there anything I can do to stop this
mail?**

Yes!

When writing "Return To Sender" stops working, or the senders won't stop
sending you mail, you have a number of options.

Your first option is to visit your local Post Office branch and fill out
a **change of address card** for them. You can't use the online form
because that requires a forwarding address. Simply fill out their name
and your address and then indicate "Moved, No Forwarding Address." Sign
it yourself, then write "Form filled in by current resident, \[your
name\], agent for the above." That last part is important, since you are
not the actual person in question. Hand the card to the postal worker,
or directly to the postmaster if you must. This should get the bulk of
the mail returned at the post office, before it ever gets to you.

If the problem is related to **junk mail**, you can address the issue
with the [[Direct Marketing
Association](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=716e0e&url=http://thedma.org){.external_link

Preference Service.

If this doesn't work either, you can **file a complaint** with the
Postmaster at your local post office. Do this by writing a letter and
handing it to the Postmaster, or you may need to set up an appointment
to talk to them. You can file a [[Prohibitory
Order](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2c9a7b&url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibitory_Order){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} against the mailer, which
if it is approved, would make it illegal for them to send you mail.

Also keep in mind, don't throw the person's mail away (unless it's just
junk mail). If it looks important, do continue to mark RTS on it and put
it back in your outgoing mail. I'm sure you'd want someone to do the
same for you if your mail was being incorrectly forwarded.
