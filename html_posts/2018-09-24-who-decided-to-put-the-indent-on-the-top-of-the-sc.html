**Who decided to put the indent on the top of the screen of the iPhone
X?**

Ah, the "notch," oh how we love thee...

To answer your specific question, phone manufacturers have two competing
priorities: create an edge-to-edge display, and also cram in a
front-facing camera and other components like retina scanners and
front-facing camera lights (and in Apple's case, all of the components
required for FaceID, like a dot projector).

So you have two choices: retain a bezel at the top of the screen (as the
Pixel and Galaxy series did), or incorporate a "notch" at the top of the
screen, like the iPhone X did (and the Essential Phone before it).

So why did Apple go with the notch? The notch approach allows the
manufacturer to claim a larger screen size, as Apple does. However, the
"notch and ears" look is cringeworthy from a design perspective. I'm
sure that if Apple could have done it, they would have hidden the
camera, the dot projector, and the face sensor underneath the display.
Indeed, they have a patent for hiding elements behind a touchscreen.
Apple tried to put their fingerprint sensor behind the display, but it
didn't work reliably, and they couldn't get it to work reliably in time
for the launch of the iPhone X. So they opted for the only other choice
that would leave them with the edge-to-edge display they had already
committed to, and still get the best screen-to-body ratio they could
achieve: move to FaceID and incorporate a notch for its sensors.

I am certain that in the future, we will see all of the elements hidden
behind a full edge-to-edge touchscreen. The Galaxy S10 will have an
in-glass fingerprint reader, so we are already headed in that direction.
For the iPhone X, the technology just wasn't there to support it.
