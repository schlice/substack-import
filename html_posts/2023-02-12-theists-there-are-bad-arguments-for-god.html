*The worst arguments for the existence of God begin with "The Bible
says...".*

This is a bad argument, not because it is untrue, but because it is
illogical. It is an example of **circular logic**.

The word "apologetics" means a systematic defense of religion. The word
is derived from the Greek word *apologia* (ἀπολογία), which means
"defense" in the classical Greek legal sense. From Wikipedia:

> In the Classical Greek legal system, the prosecution delivered the
> *kategoria* (κατηγορία), the accusation or charge, and the defendant
> replied with an *apologia*, the defense. The *apologia* was a formal
> speech or explanation to reply to and rebut the charges. A famous
> example is Socrates\' *Apologia* defense, as chronicled in Plato\'s
> *Apology*.[\[1\]](#UvGRT){#cite-UvGRT .citation_link}

Anyway, back to the argument. The argument basically says:

1.  The Bible is the inspired word of God
2.  The Bible says that God exists.
3.  Therefore, God exists.

The problem is Statement 1. This is a statement without proof. It's not
wrong, but it's unsupported with logic. It assumes facts not in
evidence.
