You are correct, in most countries, the military falls under the
president in terms of legitimate authority.

So the military can take over the government in only one way: illegally,
***by force***.

A military commander decides that the government is corrupt and that
there is only one way to deal with that corrupt government: oust them
from office at the end of a gun barrel. Literally. Walk into his office
and place him in military detention. Do the same for all of the other
governmental officials. Literally take over the operations of the
government by force.

It is, indeed, an illegitimate usurpation of power in most countries,
but if it is done by force, at the end of a gun barrel, who will stop
them?

The only people who can stop them are people with bigger/more guns, or
when they decide to turn the power back over to a civilian government
that they install or one that they allow to take over.
