**Am I required to identify myself if a police officer rings my doorbell
in the state of Florida, or can I just say I need a lawyer?**

You're not even required to open the door.

If you don't want to talk to the police at your door, don't. Just don't
answer the door. No law says you are required to answer the door.

Just know that if they have a search warrant, they can break your door
and then you have to fix it.

Hope they don't have a search warrant.
