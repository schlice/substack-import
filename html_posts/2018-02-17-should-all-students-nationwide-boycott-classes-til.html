Let's turn this back on you instead of trying to take issue with the
question.

**What does sensible gun control look like?**

Tell us what sensible gun control looks like and we'll discuss it. Let's
see some examples of what you would consider "sensible" gun control. We
can discuss what you think is "sensible."

(EDIT) Unsurprisingly, Anonymous hasn\'t answered the question. He or
she just spat a pointless and illogical question out, and didn\'t bother
to clarify. Meh.
