**If the hot water isn\'t available for a week (in an all utilities paid
agreement) and the landlord is responsible for fixing it, what are the
tenant rights in such situation?**

One of the things we like to say on Quora is that in legal situations,
it depends.

However, in this case, this is one of those things that is not dependent
on where you live.

In every jurisdiction, landlords are required to provide a safe,
healthy, and livable space. It doesn't have to be in your lease; rental
properties are covered under an *implied warranty of habitability.* One
of the items which is required in order to make a space safe, healthy
and livable is hot water. Because hot water is a requirement, it is
usually considered an emergency repair if the hot water is out.

Depending on where you live, you may have different remedies available
to you. In most cases though these are pretty much the same.

**First*, you should file a written request for hot water repair.*** If
the landlord has not repaired the hot water within 24 hours of notice,
you can do one of the following. You should check with your local
tenants rights group or an attorney to find out which one of these you
can legally do in your jurisdiction:

1.  Withhold your rent payment and make the repair on your own using the
    amount of your monthly rent to pay for the repair. Withhold only
    enough rent payments to repay the cost to repair the water. Document
    exactly how much rent you need to withhold and send your
    documentation instead of your rent payment.
2.  Instead of withholding rent, pay for the repair and then charge this
    cost to the landlord through an invoice. File a lawsuit if the
    landlord refuses to pay the invoice.
3.  File a lawsuit against the landlord for not providing conditions as
    indicated in the leasing agreement, and for not providing a safe
    living condition under the implied contract of habitability.

In some jurisdictions, you also may be able to break your lease without
penalty in such a situation. Again, check with your local tenants rights
organization or with a real estate attorney who specializes in
landlord/tenant law in your local area before you move out.
