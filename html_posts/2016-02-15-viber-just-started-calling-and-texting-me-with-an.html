really answered the question, but I\'ll add my \$0.02 anyway.

Viber is a pretty cool service. It allows you to share free calls, SMS,
and pictures with anyone, and it\'s cross-platform. You might [[check it
out](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=35590b&url=http://www.viber.com){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="viber.com"}]{.qlink_container}.

When you sign up, you enter your phone number. The system will then send
you a SMS message with a confirmation code you must enter back in the
site. This closes the loop, ensuring the number is correct, and ensuring
someone is not trying to sign you up for something without your
knowledge. It\'s a security feature.

Looks like in this case, someone was trying to sign themselves up and
they mis-typed their phone number. The mistype ended up being your
number.

It is **safe to ignore** those messages.

When the person discovers that he is not getting his SMS message, he
will check his information and discover his error.
