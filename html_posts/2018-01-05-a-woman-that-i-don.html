**A woman that I don't know left me a voicemail, "by law you have to put
me on the do not call list, by law". She then ordered me to put her on
the do not call list, and hung up. Is what she said true, or can I just
not pick up the phone?**

LOL, unless you are a telemarketer, I don't really think you have
anything to worry about. If you didn't call her, you're in good shape.

Feel free to ignore the voicemail, and have a good day.
