So in order to avoid "cheap grace," we have to understand what it is.

The term "cheap grace" was coined by Dietrich Bonhoeffer in his book,
*The Cost of Discipleship*. It is a result of a debate in Christianity
in the 80s and 90s over what is known as **Lordship Salvation**.

During that time, some evangelical pastors were championing a teaching
called "carnal Christianity." The idea behind it is that **once one
makes a confession of faith, they are saved,** ***even if there is no
immediate obedience to the commands of Jesus and the apostles to live a
life of holiness***

In other words, the idea says "We can have Jesus as **savior**, but we
do not need to have Jesus as **Lord**."

Bonhoeffer defines "cheap grace" as "the preaching of forgiveness
without requiring repentance, baptism without church discipline.
Communion without confession. Cheap grace is grace without discipleship,
grace without the cross, grace without Jesus Christ." Notice what is
emphasized in Bonhoeffer's definition of cheap grace and what is
de-emphasized. **It's called "cheap" because it de-emphasizes the true
cost of being a disciple.**

People who advocate for carnal Christianity, or "free grace" as it's
often called, do not deny the necessity of good works (i.e., holy
living) for sanctification, but they distinguish *the call for
salvation* from *the call to sanctification (or discipleship).*

Cheap grace masks the cost of discipleship from people. It asserts that
as long as we make a profession of faith, we are saved. While this is
indeed true, salvation by grace alone through faith alone is so much
more than simply speaking the words "Jesus is Lord."

So to avoid "cheap grace," we need to remember exactly what salvation
is, and everything that it involves:

> We are not saved by a profession of faith. We are not saved by praying
> the Sinner's Prayer. We are not saved by signing a card or walking an
> aisle. We are saved by a living and active faith (James 2:14-26), a
> faith that manifests itself in repentance, obedience and love of God
> and our neighbor. Salvation is not a transaction; it's a
> transformation. Paul says it best when he says we are "new creations"
> in Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17). There is nothing "cheap" about
> grace\![\[1\]](#gFyUE){#cite-gFyUE .citation_link}
