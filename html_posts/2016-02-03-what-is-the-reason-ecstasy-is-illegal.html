In the United States, drugs are classified on the Schedule of Controlled
Substances under the Controlled Substances Act. They are generally
classified using three categories:

1.  Accepted medical uses
2.  Potential for abuse, or how addictive it is
3.  Accepted safety standards for safe use, even under medical
    supervision

For drugs which have no accepted medical uses, have a high potential for
abuse, and have no established safety standards for their use, they are
classified as Schedule I. They cannot be prescribed by doctors, and they
cannot be legally sold. It\'s also illegal to even procure the drug in
order to test it to find accepted medical uses (which I never really
understood, but that\'s just me). The vast majority of our illegal drugs
fall into this category.

Depending on whether or not a drug meets any of the above standards, it
may be placed in a lower schedule, which might allow it to be prescribed
by a doctor, or be included in formulations with other drugs.

MDMA (or Ecstasy) has no accepted medical uses, has a high potential for
abuse, and has no accepted safety standards for safe use. Therefore, it
has been placed on Schedule I.

(Cue the people who believe it should be on Schedule III)
