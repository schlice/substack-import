**Why do some criminals never go beyond committing crimes such as
robbery, and others escalate to the biggest crimes, such as murder?**

Because even criminals have a line which they will not cross.

I know, you think that if you break one law, you break them all, but
that's hardly true at all. Almost everyone has a "line" past which they
will not go, even criminals.

Think about this: petty crime has petty consequences. Serious crime has
serious consequences. If you're in a state with the death penalty,
murder could get you the needle, and most criminals won't even go there.

Criminals aren't deterred by laws. Criminals are deterred by the fact
that breaking laws has consequences.
