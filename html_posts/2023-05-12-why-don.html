- There was a great answer that already addressed why Protestants do not
  have the Apocrypha in their Bibles:

[[R. Eric Sawyer\'s answer to Is it true that Martin Luther and John
Calvin removed the Deuterocanonical books from their biblical Canon
because 2 Maccabees 12 : 43-46 provides a scriptural basis to the
purgatory?](/Is-it-true-that-Martin-Luther-and-John-Calvin-removed-the-Deuterocanonical-books-from-their-biblical-Canon-because-2-Maccabees-12-43-46-provides-a-scriptural-basis-to-the-purgatory/answer/R-Eric-Sawyer)]{.qlink_container}

- Even without the Apocrypha, the Bible contains all the answers that
  any Christian may need.
