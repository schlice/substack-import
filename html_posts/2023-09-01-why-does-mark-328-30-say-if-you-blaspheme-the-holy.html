Ah yes, another question about the "unpardonable sin."

We do teach in Christianity that no one is beyond salvation. God's love
is infinite, and so **anyone** who has sinned can be forgiven. But yet,
this discussion of the "unpardonable sin" remains for us today. Let's
review.

First, you can't just look at Mark 3:28--30. You have to look at the
context to understand what happened here. **For text, without context,
is just pretext.**

So let's widen the scope of the passage to get a better understanding of
what happened. Let's instead read Mark 3:**20**--30:

> Then Jesus entered a house, and again a crowd gathered, so that he and
> his disciples were not even able to eat. When his family heard about
> this, they went to take charge of him, for they said, "He is out of
> his mind."
>
> And the teachers of the law who came down from Jerusalem said, "He is
> possessed by Beelzebul! By the prince of demons he is driving out
> demons."
>
> So Jesus called them over to him and began to speak to them in
> parables: "How can Satan drive out Satan? If a kingdom is divided
> against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. If a house is divided
> against itself, that house cannot stand. And if Satan opposes himself
> and is divided, he cannot stand; his end has come. In fact, no one can
> enter a strong man's house without first tying him up. Then he can
> plunder the strong man's house. Truly I tell you, people can be
> forgiven all their sins and every slander they utter, but whoever
> blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; they are
> guilty of an eternal sin."
>
> He said this because they were saying, "He has an impure spirit."
> (NIV)

So in this case, Jesus drove out an evil spirit, and "the teachers of
the law" (who we know to be the Pharisees) came down from Jerusalem,
*witnessed what Jesus was doing*, and **dismissed the miracles they were
seeing**. They instead blamed Satan for Jesus' ability to drive out a
demon.

Jesus told the crowd, "How can Satan drive out Satan?" Doesn't really
make much sense, does it? How can Satan oppose Satan? If Satan can
oppose himself, then he has no power at all. So it is simply illogical
that it is by Satan that Jesus could drive out spirits.

Therefore, Jesus continues, **you Pharisees are blaspheming the work of
the Holy Spirit**. Jesus knew their heart. He knew that they knew
exactly the source of His authority, and they *knowingly and willingly
denied it, in an attempt to slander both Jesus and the Holy Spirit.*

***THAT IS THE UNPARDONABLE SIN.***

*Witnessing Jesus perform a miracle and attributing His power to Satan,
or denying God's authority as personally witnessed.*

So how does this apply to us today? *It doesn't.* We can't see Jesus
performing miracles and then attribute Jesus' power to Satan, so *we
cannot commit the unpardonable sin*.

But is there a sin that we can commit which we cannot be pardoned for?
If God's love is infinite, we can ask to be forgiven of anything, and if
we truly repent and believe, we will be forgiven, right? Jesus even
says, "people can be forgiven all their sins and every slander they
utter," yet is there something that we can do (or not do) that cannot be
forgiven?

**We can fail to repent and believe before we die.**

This life is the only opportunity we have to give our lives to Christ.
If you know of Christ, and you believe in His salvific work, **and you
refuse to give your life to Him, you refuse to repent and believe,**
***and then you die*, you cannot be saved.**

This life is your one chance to be saved.

Don't miss it.
