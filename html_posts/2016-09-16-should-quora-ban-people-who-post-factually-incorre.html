Nope. They can't, because they don't employ doctors of every specialty
to fact-check every answer. Nor are they required to under the law.

**Quora should do a better job of drilling it into people's heads that
you shouldn't get actionable medical advice from a question and answer
site.**

I'm not a doctor, but I've spent so much time as a patient advocate that
I can speak partly intelligently about multiple sclerosis. I'm also an
MS patient, so I can speak about my experience with the disease.

That said, I make it a point to not give out medical advice. I
***always*** say "talk to your neurologist about xxx" or "you should
make sure you discuss this with your doctor" or "You can learn from my
experience, but don't change your diet/medicine/exercise routine without
talking to your doctor first." Because that's what I would do. But at a
certain point, I can only do so much. Can I make a mistake? Of course I
can, I'm not a doctor. But even if I was, I'm not your doctor. I don't
know your medical history. I don't know all the drugs you are taking, or
have access to your medical records. I wouldn't even be able to give
accurate, medically-relevant medical advice to one person.

People should also see the disclaimer on the message and take that to
heart. I've attached the disclaimer to this message, even though this
isn't a medical question, so that you can see it. We're already legally
protected when we provide medical answers. What more do you want?
Eventually, people have to be smart enough to know that you get what you
pay for, and *caveat emptor*. How much do you pay for medical advice on
Quora? Exactly my point. Remember the lyrics: "Talk is cheap, and free
advice is worth the price you pay."
