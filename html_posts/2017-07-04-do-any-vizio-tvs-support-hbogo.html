It looks like, from [[Vizio's
website](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=596ad3&url=https://www.vizio.com/via-chart){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="vizio.com"}]{.qlink_container}, that they do not.

My suggestion: don't work so hard to get a "smart TV." Get a great TV
with a great display and plug smart things into it.

Plug in a game console, or plug in a Chromecast, or a Kindle Fire TV
Stick, or an Apple TV, or a Roku, or any number of similar smart
devices. You will save more in the long run, and you will have better
support for apps on your device than you will on a "smart TV."
