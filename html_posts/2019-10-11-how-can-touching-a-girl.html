**How can touching a girl\'s arm be a sexual assault? A shy schoolboy
wanted to make a friend but was lost for words, so instead, he touched
the girl\'s arm, and he's now convicted of sexual assault.**

When they convicted him, the magistrates told him:

> The complainant\'s evidence was very clear, logical and without
> embellishment. We can think of no motivation for you to touch the
> victim other than sexual.
>
> Had she not taken evasive action the assault was likely to have been
> even more serious.
>
> The first assault can be recognised as opportunistic however there is
> more evidence of premeditation in the second.

Their conclusion comes, in part, from the victim assuming facts not in
evidence. He was attempting to touch her arm. She believed that he was
attempting to touch her breast, but she moved, and the touch ended up on
her arm.

Magistrates used that statement to *imply* that the defendant *actually*
wanted to sexually assault the girl. A sexual assault did not occur.
However, because the victim believed that the suspect actually wanted to
touch her breast, and it was only her movement that made it a touch on
the arm, the boy was convicted. Additionally, because it happened twice,
on two separate occasions. Put all this together, and the magistrates
find it to be a sexual assault.
