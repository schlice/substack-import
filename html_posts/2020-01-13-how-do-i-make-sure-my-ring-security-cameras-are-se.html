**How do I make sure my Ring security cameras are secure from hackers?**

[[You probably have heard news
reports](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0bce20&url=https://blog.ring.com/2019/12/12/rings-services-have-not-been-compromised-heres-what-you-need-to-know/?medium%3Dtsa%26gclid%3DCjwKCAiAx_DwBRAfEiwA3vwZYhfMSNlU8_zdBvcU5IrP92hG2-K8Q738WbQ6IIWicbCo81NTj6pwEBoCDjYQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds){.external_link

compromised.

This isn't exactly what happened.

Ring users re-used the same username and password for separate,
external, non-Ring services, and malicious actors gained access to those
credentials and used them to access Ring accounts. **Ring itself is
secure, it was never directly compromised.**

But in case you haven't heard this a million times before, let me say it
one more time:

***DO NOT REUSE YOUR PASSWORDS ACROSS WEBSITES!***

Oftentimes, your username is your email address, so malicious actors can
learn your username simply by scraping email addresses.

However, you should be implementing some smart, common-sense security
practices to keep all your accounts safe, not just Ring:

- **Never re-use passwords between websites.** Use a password manager
  like
  [[LastPass](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2813ec&url=http://lastpass.com){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
  qt-tooltip="lastpass.com"}]{.qlink_container},
  [[1Password](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=bb2366&url=https://1password.com){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
  qt-tooltip="1password.com"}]{.qlink_container}, or
  [[KeePass](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8b7a71&url=https://keepass.info/){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
  qt-tooltip="keepass.info"}]{.qlink_container}. Generate strong
  passwords for every one of your accounts on every website. Never
  re-use passwords between websites. LastPass even offers a "security
  challenge" where it checks over all of the stored passwords in your
  browser and looks for reused passwords, helping you reset them to
  strong passwords which it securely stores.
- **Use two-factor authentication (when offered).** Many web-enabled
  services now offer two-factor authentication: something you know, and
  something you have. Your two factors are usually your password
  (something you know) and a token delivered by mobile phone in a text
  message or by email, or by a token generator app (something you have).
  Ring offers the ability to secure your account with two-factor
  authentication. If a website offers you the ability to do so, I
  strongly recommend you do this.
- (Ring-specific) **Use "shared users" to give others permission to see
  your Ring account**. Ring offers you the ability to create authorized
  users who can access your account and view your cameras. They are
  called "shared users." If you need to give others the ability to see
  and control your Ring cameras, create shared users; **do not share
  your account credentials**.
