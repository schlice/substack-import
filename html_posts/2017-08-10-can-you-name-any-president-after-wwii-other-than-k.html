Nope. And Kennedy didn't make me proud to be American, either. He didn't
make me sad to be American, but he didn't make me proud.

Presidents don't make me proud to be an American. Ever. They can say
great words, but those come from speechwriters. Obama had masterful
speechwriters and he was a great orator, so he could evoke a great deal
of emotion. Good for him; he'll have a great career as a public speaker
now that he's left office.

I am proud to be an American because I have what the rest of the world
can only imagine, and some actively dream of: **freedom**. And there is
no one who will change that. No president will be able to take it away.
No one person will change it. My destiny is in my hands. Whether I
become a bzillionaire or whether I'll be a client at the soup kitchen
instead of a server is entirely up to me.

But we have to be vigilant, and *maintain* that freedom, or one day,
"...we will spend our sunset years telling our children, and our
children's children, what it was once like in the United States when men
were free." That was part of a speech that Ronald Reagan gave.

I'm proud to be an American because of the *Constitution.* I'm proud of
the Constitution and what it stands for. Politicians don't do anything
for me, as they all support and defend the Constitution, just like I
did. I'm proud of what the Constitution represents to us, and the
freedoms it guarantees. And I'm proud that I was, for a short time, part
of the band of brothers who was on the front lines "supporting and
defending" that Constitution and our way of life.

Maybe it's because it feels a little different when you've pledged to
give your life in your country's defense. Maybe it's a lack of
historical context that causes you to be proud of a country because it
has a great orator as its elected leader. But for me, the president is
just the head of the executive branch. There are three branches of
government, and none is supposed to be more powerful than any of the
others. This "balance of power" is what was originally designed to keep
our country from becoming a dictatorship or a monarchy or an oligarchy.
And so far, it's done a pretty good job. Did a president do that? Did a
Congressman or a Supreme Court judge do that? It is only the
Constitution that did that.

And it is only our *belief* in the ideals written there, and our
*willingness* to further those ideals, that keep the ship upright. The
fact that we've endured as a Constitutional Republic for more than 200
years is testament to the willingness of the population to do just that.

We don't support a President. We support a Constitution.

**THAT** is why I'm proud to be an American.
