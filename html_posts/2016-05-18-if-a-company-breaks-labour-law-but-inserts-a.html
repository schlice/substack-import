In this particular case, Disney was the first to violate the higher
statute (Federal immigration law) which specifically says that you can't
replace positions currently held by Americans directly with H1B
employees.

The part you're referring to has to do with termination clauses.
Normally, when you are terminated, you are offered a severance package.
Think of it as "X number of months that we'll continue to pay you as if
you're an employee, even though you're fired." They can then add a
clause in that termination agreement which says, "If you take this deal,
you can't talk to anyone about this issue, and you can't sue the company
over your termination." If you do (talk or sue), you forfeit your
package and you owe them the money they paid you. You can still sue, but
you can't keep the money.

This is legal, as you are generally an "at-will" employee. You weren't
under "contract" before, so the company is free to fire you at any time
and they owe you nothing. If they give you something, it's generally
going to come with strings attached. No rights are being denied; you are
still free to file suit against the company. However, if you do, and
your termination agreement contained a "can't sue/can't talk" clause,
you can't keep any money from the severance package.

In this case, Disney did not include that particular clause in the
termination agreement, so these fired workers are free to keep their
severance package **and** still participate in a lawsuit claiming
wrongful termination under Federal law.
