**Content:** [\"Unalienable,\" not \"inalienable.\" As [[Rod D.
Martin](https://www.quora.com/profile/Rod-D-Martin)]{.qlink_container}
pointed out, \"inalienable\" rights are ones that no one can take away,
but you can conceivably give up. \"Unalienable\" rights are ones that
even you can\'t give up. Unalienable rights are ones that are so much a
part of you that they can never be given away.]{.rendered_qtext}
