**Content:** [Like [[Rick

mentioned in his answer, I saw my dad as invincible. He was a hero to
me. Also, he was never involved much in my life. I was raised basically
by my mom. She was the boss in our house. And when dad stepped in, it
was usually with a heavy hand. Don\'t get me wrong, I wasn\'t abused as
a child, but corporal punishment dealt by dad was of the harsher
variety.\
\
I learned to be comfortable around police officers. I got to see a side
of them that few get to see: a *human* side. I learned that they are
real people, and they also tend to socialize best with each other.\
\
His selflessness fostered in me what my wife calls a \"servant\'s
heart\" which has guided my chosen career paths to this day.\
\
Also, being the child of a cop gives you some great war stories, but I
will save those for another question.]{.rendered_qtext}
