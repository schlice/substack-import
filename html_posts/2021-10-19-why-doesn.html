**Android does allow root access as a permission. Smartphone
manufacturers and carriers do not.**

You can include an open-source operating system on a closed-source
device and then proceed to lock down the open-source operating system.
This is what happens in the case of Android.

When Android is bundled with carrier and manufacturer software, their
software overlays remove the ability for Android users to gain root
access in order to protect the integrity of some of their hardware and
software features, and also in order to maintain the stability of the
devices and provide the best overall user experience.

For example, Samsung phones include Knox software to provide for a
*trusted computing base* (TCB) on which app providers can build apps
securely, like banking apps, and can also allow users to load virtual
credit cards and other items which require special protection and
handling. But it is only the stability and security of the TCB which
allows these software writers to make these apps and provide any sort of
guarantee to their users (and to the banks that issue the credit cards)
that their information is safe within the app from hackers. In other
words, when you lock your phone, your data within the TCB is secure and
cannot be obtained until you unlock your phone. The TCB provides this.

Root-level access could bypass the security protocols in Knox and
invalidate the security of the TCB. So if you root your Samsung phone,
an e-fuse is tripped, and Knox software will no longer function because
the safety and stability of the TCB can no longer be guaranteed.

Original question:

Why doesn\'t Android allow root access as just another permission (or
via an opt-in option in the developer menu)?
