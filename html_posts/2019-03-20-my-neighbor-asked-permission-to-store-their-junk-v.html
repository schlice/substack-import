**My neighbor asked permission to store their junk vehicle (500\$ value)
on my lot for a couple months, I went to ask them to remove it six
months later to find they moved with no contact info- dick move to have
it towed?**

Not necessarily a dick move, but may be an illegal move.

Abandoned vehicle laws vary by state. How long the vehicle has to be on
your property before it is considered abandoned and what you are allowed
to do with it all vary by state. [[This
website](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=59d1cd&url=https://www.titlegods.com/blog/2018/7/30/how-to-report-or-title-an-abandoned-car){.external_link

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="titlegods.com"}]{.qlink_container} has a great list of laws
by state discussing abandoned cars. Make sure you understand your
state's laws before you have it towed.

If the appropriate time has passed and you can't reach the original
owner, you should probably contact your local law enforcement
(non-emergency number, please) and report an abandoned car on your
property. Explain the entire situation to them, and let them contact a
tow company to properly impound the vehicle. They will also try to
contact the registered owner of the vehicle before it is declared
abandoned.

The previously mentioned website has information if you want to get
title to the vehicle instead of just reporting it abandoned and getting
it towed. You only need to pursue re-titling it if you want to take
possession of it. You can have it towed as an abandoned vehicle without
obtaining title first.
