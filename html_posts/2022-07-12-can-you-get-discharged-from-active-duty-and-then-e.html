It depends on the condition of your discharge. In the vast majority of
cases, those with honorable discharges from active duty can turn around
and join the Reserves. It's not a guarantee; every situation is
different. Talk to your recruiter if you want to go this route.

If you were enlisted on AD and went on to get your Bachelor's degree in
your away time, you can even join the Reserves as an officer, at least
in the Air Force. You'll have to attend OTS (we jokingly called OTS
graduates "90-day wonders"), and then you'll have to serve in the
Reserves as an officer.
