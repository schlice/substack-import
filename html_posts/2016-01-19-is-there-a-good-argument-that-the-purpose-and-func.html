When military police detain a military member, he is not arrested and
thrown in the brig. He may be held in a detention cell temporarily, but
he is not hauled off to jail. He is turned over to his commander (or
first sergeant if he is enlisted). His commander then decides whether or
not Article 15 proceedings will be initiated, based on a review of all
the evidence provided by investigators. Accordingly, that commander will
be held to account for his eventual decision. Nevertheless, a commander
is involved, up until the point where an Article 15 proceeding begins.
Following that decision, the military justice system takes over, and
military lawyers are involved. Military lawyers both argue for the
government, and defend the accused. Article 15 hearings are held in
front of a panel comprised of both military judges and military
commanders (not the commander of the defendant\'s unit).

I hope this answers your question.
