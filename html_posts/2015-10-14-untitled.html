<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [Then this is a failing of the justice system that allowed
them to occur. Judges are supposed to be the voice of reason in the
process (assuming that the police are simply non-thinking brutes, much
like pit bulls straining against their chains, just itching to be let
off the leash). Judges are supposed to analyze the evidence and only
employ them when the circumstances absolutely call for them.\
\
So that means that either judges are becoming more lenientin allowing
them, or the times that they have actually been needed has actually
increased. Don\'t discount the fact that crime and criminals may have
become more violent since the 80\'s.]{.rendered_qtext}
