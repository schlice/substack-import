(EDIT) Let's clarify **workers** first. To be clear, Trump has never
been accused of not paying *employees* (there was a case regarding
overtime pay for some casino employees, which was settled). He has only
been accused of not fully paying *contractors* the originally
agreed-upon price for one reason or another.

You can't simply refuse to pay contractors for the work they do. They
sue you and you win. If it was as cut-and-dried as that, then every
person who did a job and wasn't paid would sue and win.

However, what these contractors are upset about is when Trump has:

- Filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, changing their repayment terms
- Refused to pay the full amount or reduced the final payment based on a
  satisfaction clause in their contract

Trump has filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy on four separate occasions in the
last 25 years.

On four separate occasions, Trump companies filed for Chapter 11
reorganization. Chapter 11 allows Trump to renegotiate the terms of
debts. It allows him to elongate repayment times, delaying repayment.
This affects every contractor who has contracted to do work for Trump.

In other cases, Trump has attempted to re-negotiate contracts when work
was sub-par, or didn't meet his standards. Granted, his standards are a
little nebulous, but he is a businessman, and life is not fair.
Contractors are not paid fairly because it's a fair thing to do.
Contractors get paid what they deserve for the work they do when they
deliver the work as promised, and on time. The system is "just," not
"fair." There is a big difference between the two.

If Trump "unjustly" withheld payment, he should be sued. And in over 60
cases, he was sued. But if his contracts included a **satisfaction
clause**, which many Trump contracts with tradesmen are purported to
include, he does have the right to reduce final payment if the work does
not meet his standard for satisfaction. Most of those cases were settled
out of court, some of those cases are still ongoing. It is time
consuming because, strictly speaking, this is an illusory promise, since
the promisor has no actual legal burden to pay if he chooses not to.
However, courts will generally imply in law that the promisor must act
in good faith and reject the deal only if he is genuinely dissatisfied.
It takes time to prove genuine dissatisfaction with a trade's work, and
these are legitimate contractual issues you have to deal with when you
include items like satisfaction clauses in your contracts, and you
refuse payment as a standard business practice.
