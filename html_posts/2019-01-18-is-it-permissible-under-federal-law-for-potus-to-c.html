**Is it permissible under Federal Law for POTUS to commit crimes and not
be indicted for them?**

Under current interpretation of Federal law, **most likely yes.**

The President can commit a crime while in office and (most likely)
cannot be indicted for that crime while he is still in office. It's
never been tried. Special Counsel Robert Mueller has stated that it's
unlikely you can indict a sitting president, at least under Federal law.
He potentially could be indicted by a state, but I'm pretty sure the
White House doesn't have extradition treaties with US states, and a
criminal indictment by a state would probably be deemed to cause too
much interference to the job of the president to stand. The statute
would be tolled until the president was no longer president (either
naturally through election or through the impeachment process).

Back to committing a crime and not being indicted. This doesn't mean he
can't be held accountable for crimes committed in office. It simply
means that during the time he is president, he most likely can't be
indicted.

The Constitutional remedy for this is to *impeach* the president, remove
him from office, and **then** indict him for his crime.
