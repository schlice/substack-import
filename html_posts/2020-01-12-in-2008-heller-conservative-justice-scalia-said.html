**In 2008 Heller, Conservative Justice Scalia said " the Second
Amendment right is not unlimited." What limitations do you find
reasonable and acceptable, and why?**

I think the ones we have are pretty good. Those judged by a court to be
mentally defective may not own guns. Those convicted of felonies may not
own guns (although if I had my way, I would limit this to violent
felonies).

Criminals, of course, care nothing about the law, so violent felons will
possess guns if they choose anyway. The mentally defective must be
protected from themselves, so that is a different story altogether.

So is there a way to make criminals care more about the law?

Sure. *Start enforcing it consistently.*

Criminals know they will likely never be charged for a gun crime.
Prosecutors frequently plea bargain the gun charge away to convict on a
"bigger" crime. Criminals use the gun charge as leverage to get a
reduced sentence in plea deals.

This practice must stop if we hope to reduce crime committed with guns.
If we do not, criminals will continue to use guns to commit crime,
unafraid of any consequence, because there truly is none.
