Let's take your two questions in order:

> **As Jesus said, if a person who lives a good, moral life dies without
> believing, will he go to hell?**

It's hard to believe that a "good person" might end up outside of the
gates of the Kingdom of God, and not be let in.

***Isn't it "good enough" to just be a good person?***

The Bible is clear: it is not "good enough" to just "be a good person."
If this were true, then we wouldn't need Jesus. We'd get into heaven all
by ourselves. It would be *our* efforts which saved us.

But this is absolutely not the case. There is nothing we can do to save
ourselves. In fact, without God's intervention, we are ***dead*** in our
sins.

> those who are disobedient. All of us also lived among them at one

Can a dead man save himself? Nope. It is only through the grace of God
that we are saved. Without God, we are powerless to save ourselves. **It
is by grace that we are saved, not by our own works.** A little further
in Paul's letter to the Ephesians, he continues:

> *For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your
> own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no
> one may boast. --- Ephesians 2:8--9 NIV*

You are saved by grace, not your own works.

\

> **Will God, who tells those who slap you to turn the other cheek,
> respond to good people with evil?**

You are basically saying that it is **evil** for God to tell unbelievers
(who also lived a good life) that they cannot enter the Kingdom of
Heaven without believing.

But is it really *evil* though? If a person cannot be bothered to
worship God for an hour a week, would it be a kindness to bring them
into the Kingdom of Heaven where we will be worshipping God 24x7x365? To
an unbeliever, that actually sounds like torture. It would be cruel,
therefore, to impose such an eternity on to an unbeliever. It is
actually an act of mercy to exclude them from God's kingdom.

Even Jesus said that "good people who don't believe" won't be saved:

> *"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of
> heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in
> heaven. Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not
> prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your
> name perform many miracles?' Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never
> knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!'" --- Matthew 7:21--23 NIV*

Those people did very good things. They drove out demons in Jesus' name.
They performed miracles in Jesus' name! They were *preachers!* They
prophesied in Jesus' name and proclaimed His Good News. They still
didn't go to heaven because they didn't repent and believe.

You'll probably be surprised at the number of pastors who end up in
hell. Or maybe you won't, I don't know.

The bottom line is **you can't "do good" into heaven.** You can only do
God's will to get into Heaven.
