Pointing a gun at someone is a **felony.** In Florida, [[Florida Statute
ยง
784.021](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6de044&url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode%3DDisplay_Statute%26URL%3D0700-0799/0784/0784.html){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="state.fl.us"}]{.qlink_container} defines aggravated assault
as "an assault with a deadly weapon without intent to kill or with an
intent to commit a felony." At a very minimum, pointing a gun at someone
is an aggravated assault.

If someone points a gun at me, I would be in fear for my life. In order
to use deadly force, someone must be engaging in a felony which places
me in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm.

I believe, therefore, that if someone is pointing a gun at me, I am
within my rights to use whatever force I can to stop that felony, up to
and including deadly force.

So if the Sheriff (I assume you're talking about [[the case out of
Flagler
County](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=31e697&url=https://www.news-journalonline.com/story/news/crime/2023/05/30/flagler-sheriff-florida-man-threatens-to-shoot-woman-in-driveway-rage/70270332007/){.external_link

months ago) said that if someone points a gun at you and cocks it you
can shoot them, he's referring to the fact that you can defend yourself
against an aggravated assault with a deadly weapon with deadly force.
