**What can we do to protect community around our house without setting
up HOA?**

Maybe I'm not sure what you're asking. Protect the community around your
house from what, exactly?

As an individual homeowner in a neighborhood with no organized HOA, you
have responsibility and authority over *your property*, and that's it.
Everything within your property line is your responsibility. Everything
outside of your property line is not your responsibility and you can do
nothing to protect it.

If there is common area on which there is no house, it is still owned by
someone. It could be owned by a charity. It could be owned by a builder.
It could be owned by a property management company. Whoever owns it,
find out who it is. City records will show you who owns the property.
Talk to that person or organization. See if you can work out whatever
"protection" you would like to implement.

But understand that you have more collective bargaining power when
homeowners band together in a city-recognized and legally chartered
organization than you do as "a few homeowners."
