**If a person is hit by a vehicle in autonomous mode with a driver
behind the wheel, who should be held at fault?**

Under current law, the driver of the vehicle is always responsible for
what the car does.

Current law requires a driver in the driver's seat in command of the
vehicle even if the vehicle is operating in self-driving mode. The
driver is responsible for maintaining situational awareness the entire
time the vehicle is self-driving, and the driver is responsible for
stepping in and preventing the vehicle from doing anything that the
driver would not do.

Therefore, self-driving mode is currently not an issue in any states
which allow its use; the driver remains responsible at all times.
