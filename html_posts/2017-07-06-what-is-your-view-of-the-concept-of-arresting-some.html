Once you are arrested, many of your rights under the Constitution are
curtailed.

I know, shocking, right?

The vast majority of those restrictions are put in place for your safety
and the safety of the staff at the Gray Bar Inn. This is legal, but
also, it is smart operating practice.

Allowing open protests is definitely something that would be frowned
upon while in custody.
