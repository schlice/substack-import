By "source," I assume you mean some non-Biblical record of the
Resurrection. Flavius Josephus, the greatest Jewish historian of his
time, reported that Jesus appeared to His followers three days after He
was crucified and buried. Tacitus, the Roman historian, wrote in his
final work, *Annals*, that the Roman prefect Pontius Pilate executed
Jesus. In all, there are ten non-Christian sources which had details
about the fact that Jesus' disciples believed that He was resurrected
from the dead.

As for modern research, Gary Habermas has completed the most
comprehensive investigation to date on what scholars believe about the
Resurrection. Habermas collected more than 1,400 of the most critical
scholarly works on the Resurrection written from 1975 to 2003. In [[*The
Risen Jesus and Future
Hope*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7c70a7&url=https://www.amazon.com/Risen-Jesus-Future-Hope/dp/0742532879/){.external_link

virtually all scholars from across the ideological spectrum---from
ultra-liberals to Bible-thumping conservatives---agree that the
following points concerning Jesus and Christianity are actual historical
facts:

1.  Jesus died by Roman crucifixion.
2.  He was buried, most likely in a private tomb.
3.  Soon afterwards the disciples were discouraged, bereaved, and
    despondent, having lost hope.
4.  Jesus' tomb was found empty very soon after his interment. ยน
5.  The disciples had experiences that they believed were actual
    appearances of the risen Jesus.
6.  Due to these experiences, the disciples' lives were thoroughly
    transformed. They were even willing to die for their belief.
7.  The proclamation of the Resurrection took place very early, from the
    beginning of church history.
8.  The disciples' public testimony and preaching of the Resurrection
    took place in the city of Jerusalem, where Jesus had been crucified
    and buried shortly before.
9.  The gospel message centered on the preaching of the death and
    resurrection of Jesus.
10. Sunday was the primary day for gathering and worshiping.
11. James, the brother of Jesus and a skeptic before this time, was
    converted when he believed he also saw the risen Jesus.
12. Just a few years later, Saul of Tarsus (Paul) became a Christian
    believer, due to an experience that he also believed was an
    appearance of the risen Jesus.

The acceptance of these facts makes sense in light of the existing
evidence, which shows:

- **The New Testament Story Is Not a Legend---**The New Testament
  documents were written well within two generations of the events by
  eyewitnesses or their contemporaries, and the New Testament storyline
  is corroborated by non-Christian writers. In addition, the New
  Testament mentions at least 30 historical figures who have been
  confirmed by sources outside the New Testament. Therefore, the New
  Testament story cannot be a legend.
- **The New Testament Story Is Not a Lie---**The New Testament writers
  included divergent and embarrassing details, difficult and demanding
  sayings, and they carefully distinguished Jesus' words from their own.
  They also referenced facts and eyewitnesses that their readers either
  already knew or could verify. In fact, the New Testament writers
  provoked their readers and prominent first-century enemies to check
  out what they said. If that's not enough to confirm their
  truthfulness, then their martyrdom should remove any doubt. These
  eyewitnesses endured persecution and death for the empirical claim
  that they had seen, heard, and touched the risen Jesus, yet they could
  have saved themselves by simply denying their testimony.
- **The New Testament Story Is Not an Embellishment---**The New
  Testament writers were meticulously accurate, as evidenced by well
  over 140 historically confirmed details. They recorded miracles in
  those same historically confirmed narratives, and they did so without
  apparent embellishment or significant theological comment.

So is the New Testament true? If most scholars agree with the twelve
facts stated above because the evidence shows that the New Testament
story is not a legend, a lie, or an embellishment, then we know beyond a
reasonable doubt that the New Testament writers accurately recorded what
they saw.

They recorded the fact that Jesus appeared to His disciples at least
eight different times to different people over the 40-day period since
His crucifixion.

ยน While scholars are not unanimous on the empty tomb, a *majority* of
them (about 75 percent) believe the tomb was empty. The other eleven
facts stated here enjoy nearly unanimous scholarly support.
