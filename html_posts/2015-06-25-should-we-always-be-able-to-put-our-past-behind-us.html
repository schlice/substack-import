**Content:** [\"Putting the past behind you\" is a phrase which means
that the past is history, so there is little we can do about it.\
\
We **should** be able to put the past behind us, but some have problems
with that. As [[Sara
Doubleday](https://www.quora.com/profile/Sara-Doubleday)]{.qlink_container}
said, some people get stuck in it, can\'t let it go. Sometimes, there is
a mental disease/defect that causes people to get stuck in the past.\
\
A phrase I heard, which reminds us to live in the now, is: \"The past is
history, tomorrow is a mystery. Today is a gift, that\'s why we call it
*the present*.\"]{.rendered_qtext}
