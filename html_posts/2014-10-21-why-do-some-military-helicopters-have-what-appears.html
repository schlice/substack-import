I assume this is what you\'re referring to. This is a refueling probe,
which allows for midair refueling.\

In this image, you can see a C-130 performing a mid air refueling.
Refueling a helicopter in this way is challenging. Note the forward tilt
on the helicopter blades; these helicopters are flying forward as fast
as they possibly can; the C-13o is flying at or near stall speed.
Coincidentally, if you ever see aircraft and helicopters flying together
in formation, the scenario is the same: helicopters flying full tilt and
aircraft at or near stall speed.
