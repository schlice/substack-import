In the realm of "bad questions," this one has quite a few examples of
badness:

- False dilemma fallacy: You compare two things that are either not
  comparable, or are presented as the only two options when, in fact,
  there are many. In this case, it's both. Not only are the two choices
  not comparable, but you can offer your thoughts and prayers for the
  families of the victims while simultaneously doing other things, too.
- Your statistics are wrong. Want to argue with me? Show me the source
  of your statistics. Two statistics are incorrect:
  - Trans people represent 0.011% of all mass shooters in the US
  - The US is the country with the largest number of mass shootings by a
    factor of 100 times.

We'll need to see statistics for those please.

So there's not really anything to answer here.
