It\'s very very unlikely that you would survive those shots. There are
multiple factors involved, such as how close you were to the gun, what
was the angle of incidence in which you were shot, where did the bullet
impact, where did it enter the brain, where did it exit, what is the
brain\'s capacity for self-healing, etc.\
\
Plus, when there is a traumatic brain injury, there are many other
factors that will determine survival, such as secondary infection and/or
intercranial edema.]{.rendered_qtext}
