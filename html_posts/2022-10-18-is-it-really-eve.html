Short answer: yes.

Longer answer: The Bible tells us that they knew right and wrong before
the incident with the apple. They also had *free will*. They had the
full ability to make a choice.

They knew that God had commanded them to not eat the fruit from that
tree. They knew that they would be committing a sin by doing so. *But
they chose to violate God's command, freely and willingly.*

Because they thought that what Satan offered was more appealing than
what God offered.

And that's the beauty of free will. If you're not willing to accept
God's commands, you're free to reject them. Similarly for us today, if
you're not willing to accept Christianity, you're free to reject it. The
freedom to make choices --- even the freedom to reject truth --- is what
makes us moral creatures and allows us to ultimately choose our own
destiny.

Adam and Eve chose to violate God's law and sin against Him, introducing
sin into the world for all of us. But we have the opportunity to choose
God, thanks to the sacrifice of Jesus.

Original question:

Is it really Eve\'s fault that Satan manipulated her into sinning? She
had never been exposed to lying before. Similar to two adults telling a
child different stories, you can\'t blame the child for not knowing what
to believe?
