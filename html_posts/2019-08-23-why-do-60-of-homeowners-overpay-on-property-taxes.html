**Why do 60% of homeowners overpay on property taxes?**

Reading the article by the National Taxpayer's Union, you'll find that
it's very likely that most Americans who overpay do so because they are
blissfully unaware that anywhere from 30 to 60% of taxable property in
the United States is over-assessed.

No one expects that their property is going to be over-assessed. They
think that government employees will always work for the public good,
and would never intentionally over-assess a property. Sometimes,
over-assessment is simply due to math errors. It could be that the
assessor has an outdated, incorrect or inaccurate assessment of the
actual property. But many Americans simply pay the difference because
the cost (in time and money) to get the property re-assessed is too high
to justify when compared to the amount of money you will actually save.

The process by which you can appeal the assessor's decision is lengthy
and cumbersome, while the actual reduction in taxes you see (while still
qualifying as a reduction) may not be worth the effort to get it
re-assessed and reduced.
