**In extreme circumstances, would you ever support defamation being a
crime in the US?**

I don't think "extreme" circumstances are necessary. I do think
"appropriate" circumstances are necessary. Those circumstances exist
when the traditional civil relief for libel or slander do not, and
cannot, adequately address the harm caused by the action.

For example, in the "ripped from the headlines" department, I would
support criminal defamation in the case where an accuser knowingly lies
about a sexual assault accusation. In today's society, an accusation of
sexual assault brings incredible harms to the accused, even without
evidence and without any presumption of innocence. The accused can lose
his job and his livelihood. An accusation can destroy marriages and
families, and even leads some to suicide, and all without evidence.

If this were to happen maliciously or falsely, a civil penalty could
never be enough to undo the damage done.

Sexual assault is a horrible crime and should be punished to the fullest
extent of the law. I don't want to take anything away from victims, and
the majority of women who claim they were assaulted actually were. But
we know from some recent high profile cases that not all women always
tell the truth, and some women use the accusation as a club to inflict
harm instead of as a tool for justice. I have no problem making false
allegations of sexual assault a crime of criminal defamation.
