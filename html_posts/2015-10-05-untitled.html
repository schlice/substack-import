<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [Communism means that whatever you make belongs to the
government, and the government will give you everything you need.\
\
Socialism means the government controls the means of production and
therefore controls the results of production. You\'re only given what
the government chooses to give you.\
\
Your assessment that the country is \"happier\" than the US doesn\'t
mean that socialism is better.\
\
Even in the United States, some industries are indeed controlled by the
government. Amtrak and the US Postal Service are businesses which have
been nationalized. That doesn\'t make them effective business models. It
simply means that legislators have decided that tax dollars would
support those industries.\
\
And just because I said that bridges and roads was a result of \"proper
functioning government\" doesn\'t mean that socialism means \"not proper
functioning government.\" You read that into my answer. Socialism is a
form of government. Communism is a form of government. A Federated
Republic is a form of government. I won\'t say that one is \"better\"
than the other. In some cases, some function well; in others, they do
not. In the United States, we built a model of government which is
largely not communistic or socialistic. The Federal government is
intentionally limited in size, scope, and power, and the state
governments have the authority to do far more than the Federal
government. It\'s a model that works for us. It certainly wouldn\'t work
well for every country, but it works for us.]{.rendered_qtext}
