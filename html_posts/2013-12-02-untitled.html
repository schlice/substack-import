**Content:** [You have an interesting story. I don\'t often hear of
peoples\' MS stories starting with narcolepsy. Being genetic and running
in your family, I would imagine that your narcolepsy is genuine, likely
caused by a genetic mutation passed down your family lineage.\
\
The rest of the story, however, is intriguing. Your symptoms outside of
the narcolepsy are definitely ones experienced by MS patients. The
balance and coordination, memory and bladder issues are definitely
MS-like. However, knowing your family history of genetic brain
mutations, I would look very closely at the source of these other
symptoms. MS is often called \"the Great Imitator\" since none of its
symptoms are unique to it alone.\
\
MRI technology has come a long way in 10 years. So much so that the
definition of clinical MS has changed so that a conclusive finding of
clinical MS can be made with a neurological exam, a thorough vetting of
all of the other potential causes for the symptoms, and a MRI scan
showing all of the clinical signs of someone with MS.\
\
My suggestion for you would be to see your neurologist and run down this
list with him. I would expect to see a full neurologic exam, a \"little
white spot\" assay, which is basically a battery of blood tests to rule
out other causes for white spots on an MRI, and the 1.5T high-field MRI
exam, which should only take about 45 minutes \"in the tube\" if you
have a good radiology crew. I have such a good crew here that by the
time I have re-dressed and an ready to leave, my images are already on
CD waiting for me. Of course, the radiologists report follows the next
day. One way or another, you should be able to find the source of your
symptoms. If you don\'t have a good neurologist, it is time to get one.
You need someone who specializes in MS and related neurological
diseases, or who is in a practice where such doctors also work, for easy
consultation.\
\
Good luck to you, and if I can be of any more assistance, please let me
know. As we say in the MS world, \"keep s\'myelin!\"
