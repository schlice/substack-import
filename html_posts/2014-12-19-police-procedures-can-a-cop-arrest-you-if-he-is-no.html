<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Depends on the state, but most peace officers are actually<br>commissioned through a statewide certification program and so<br>technically can enforce the law anywhere throughout the state.\<br>\<br>Besides, even if they don\'t make an \"arrest\" themselves, they can<br>\"detain\" a suspect until local law enforcement arrives to make the<br>arrest. Police officers usually make pretty good witnesses in<br>court.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
