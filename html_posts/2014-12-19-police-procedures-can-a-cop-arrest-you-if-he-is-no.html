**Content:** [Depends on the state, but most peace officers are actually
commissioned through a statewide certification program and so
technically can enforce the law anywhere throughout the state.\
\
Besides, even if they don\'t make an \"arrest\" themselves, they can
\"detain\" a suspect until local law enforcement arrives to make the
arrest. Police officers usually make pretty good witnesses in
court.]{.rendered_qtext}
