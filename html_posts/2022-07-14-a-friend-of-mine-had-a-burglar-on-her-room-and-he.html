This is a common law school question. Does the fact that a person was
trespassing alleviate the homeowner of addressing known hazards?

I mean, what if I was invited to a house party and I went into a hallway
or a room in which I was not permitted to go? Wouldn't I be just as
guilty of trespassing?

What if I was in a store looking for help from an employee and I
inadvertently went into an Employee Only area, wouldn't I be
trespassing?

My motives for being where I was don't change the fact that I was still
trespassing. Just like the burglar who fell through the skylight; at
that point, his only crime (like mine when I went into the Employees
Only area) was trespassing.

So what if I fell through an open hole in the floor in the Employees
Only area? Did the fact that I wasn't supposed to be there alleviate the
store of the responsibility of addressing the hazard? There was a hazard
and the store didn't address it.

The skylight faller fell on to a knife that was not properly secured.
That knife was a hazard. And the faller (whose only crime at that point
was trespassing) now has to deal with the physical repercussions of
rehab and medical treatments to address the cut on his leg from the
improperly stowed knife.

Bottom line: the fact that someone was trespassing doesn't alleviate the
homeowner of the responsibility to address known hazards.

Is that *fair*? No, probably not. But is it *just*? Actually, it is.

Remember, we have a system of justice, not a system of fairness.
