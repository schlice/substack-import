This is indeed a fascinating thought. **But it's not biblical.**

When Jesus was assumed into Heaven following the month of His presence
after His resurrection, there were two angels who told the disciples
that Jesus would return *in the same way they saw him depart:*

> And when he had said these things, as they were looking on, he was
> lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight. And while they
> were gazing into heaven as he went, behold, two men stood by them in
> white robes, and said, "Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into
> heaven? This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come
> in the same way as you saw him go into heaven." \-- Acts 1:9--11 ESV

So Jesus is clearly coming back, but the way He will come back was
exactly the same way He went up. And how did He go up? He was *assumed*
into Heaven. "He was lifted up, and a cloud took Him out of sight."

So we can assume that He will return on a cloud, in the same way the
disciples saw Him depart.

Not to mention, Jesus is still **fully human** as well as **fully God**.
So if He were to return as "one man or woman in each of our lives," He
wouldn't be human anymore, since humans can only exist in one place at
one time.

Finally, the time to "decide to follow Him" is **now**, because if you
haven't given your life to Him before He returns, by the time He does,
it will be too late. You don't want to be the one who waits until the
last second to believe in Him. Believe in Him ***now***. Trust Him
*today.*

Have you heard of Pascal's Wager?

*If I'm wrong, and there is no God, I've lost nothing. But if*
***you're*** *wrong, and there is a God, you've lost everything.*

Don't risk losing everything.
