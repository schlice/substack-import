**You can repent of your sin.** What I'm seeing in your question is
someone who is not truly repentant. If you like your sin you're okay
with keeping it. And if you're okay with keeping it, then you are not
truly repentant.

Repentance isn't just "saying sorry." It's a *turning away* from sin.
Think of walking in one direction and then swinging around and going the
opposite direction. That's repentance. It's an *active rejection* of
your former sinful life.

Take a look at Ephesians 2 -

> As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins, in which
> you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the
> ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in
> those who are disobedient. All of us also lived among them at one
> time, gratifying the cravings of our flesh and following its desires
> and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature deserving of wrath.
> (v.1--3 NIV)

When you live in sin, you desire sin, because that is the orientation of
your heart. You are comfortable in your sin. But worse, you are **dead**
in your sin. Can a dead man save himself? No! We can do nothing to save
ourselves from sin's grasp.

***It is only God who can save us, and He does through His grace.***
Paul continues in his letter to the Ephesians:

> But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made
> us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions---it is
> by grace you have been saved. (v.4--5 NIV)

Some of the greatest words in the Bible are right there: **BUT GOD**.
But God. Imagine that. We were dead in our sin, **but God** chose to
save us. We are dead without the intervention of God, and He does so
because of His great love for us.

So the first thing you can do is **die to self**. Repent of your sin.
Turn away from your former sinful life, "in which you used to live when
you followed the ways of this world\[.\]" This is *crucial*, because
**if you do not repent of your sin, if you do not** ***completely reject
and turn away from your sin*, you will not be saved.**

God gives you the power to reject your sin. Nothing is impossible with
God. He will provide you with the tools you need to turn away from sin.

> But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of
> the flesh. For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and
> the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed

That passage tells you that those who belong to Christ have "crucified
the flesh" and gain the fruits of the Spirit.

**Repent** and **believe**. That's how we gain eternal life. But to
repent, you'll need to "crucify" your old life. You'll need to die to
your sin. Die to your old life. Live in your new life. You must truly
desire this or you will never get past your sin. If you still like your
sin, you'll keep your sin, and your sin will keep you separated from
God. You may temporarily feel good, but you'll still be living in sin.
You must put to death the desires of the flesh, permanently.

Salvation is a free gift, but it will cost you your life.
