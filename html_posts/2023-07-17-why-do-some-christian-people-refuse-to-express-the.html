**Christians know that God gave humans dominion over all the creatures
on the planet.**

> Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have
> dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens
> and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping
> thing that creeps on the earth. --- Genesis 1:26 ESV

This means, that as the highest life form on the planet, we have full
authority over all the creatures on the planet. This also means that
while we do have the right to kill animals for food (cf Genesis 9:2), we
are simultaneously entrusted to be *caretakers* or *stewards* of God's
creation on earth.

The Bible is clear that we are to treat animals with dignity and
respect.

> A righteous man cares for the needs of his animal. --- Proverbs 12:10
> ESV

With that in mind, we can develop a biblically-sound practice of
euthanasia as well as animal abortion, in order to care for the needs of
our animals, to treat them with dignity and respect, and show them mercy
as needed.
