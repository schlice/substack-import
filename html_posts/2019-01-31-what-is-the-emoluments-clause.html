**What is the emoluments clause?**

The Emoluments Clause (Article I, Section 9, Clause 8), or the "Title of
Nobility" Clause, reads:

> No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no
> Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall,
> without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument,
> Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or
> foreign State.

the weak sides of republics, among their numerous advantages, is that
they afford too easy an inlet to foreign corruption.\" To that end, the
Emoluments Clause was designed to do two things: prevent a Nobility
Class from being established in the United States, and protect the
government from being influenced by foreign governments.

The word "emolument" has a very broad meaning, but at the time of the
Constitution's writing, it meant "benefit," "profit," or "advantage." To
that end, people who hold offices of profit or trust (like the
President) cannot receive any "benefit," "profit," or "advantage" from a
foreign government. The Office of Legal Counsel in the DOJ has stated
that this clause is violated if that person receives money from a
business or partnership, and the amount of money he receives is \"a
function of the amount paid to the \[business or partnership\] by the
foreign government.\" You can see then that the foreign government could
be directly influencing the president through the business or
partnership, which could be a way for the foreign government to exert
"undue influence or corruption."[\[1\]](#ZvNvc){#cite-ZvNvc

Most Presidents have sidestepped this issue by placing their assets into
a "blind trust." What this means is that the assets of the President are
sold, the proceeds are used to procure new assets, and the President is
unaware of the assets in the trust. He cannot know what assets are held
in trust; therefore, he can never be unduly influenced by someone
profiting his assets, because he doesn't know what they are.

President Trump presents a unique case, as his name and brand is
valuable. His properties are valuable, in part, because of his name on
them. While he can relinquish ownership and day-to-day control of his
assets, and he can divert profits to someone else (i.e. trustees), and
even if he places his assets into blind trust (which would be nearly
impossible with real property), he will always know what assets are
valuable to him, as there will always be assets with the Trump name on
them, whether or not he personally has any in blind trust.

Another interesting twist: some of Trump's properties are mortgaged, and
those mortgages are owned by foreign banks. Are any of Trump's foreign
policy deals changing his position in his mortgaged properties? More
importantly, has he made (or will he make) foreign policy decisions
based on what would be beneficial to his mortgage instead of what is
beneficial to the country? You can be sure that the Office of Legal
Counsel is scrutinizing every one of Trump's assets and their holdings
very closely, to avoid even the appearance of impropriety.
