Let's clarify terms. The people I'll call "vaxxers" are people who
believe that the government should force everyone who is able to get the
vaccine whether they want to or not, because it's best for everyone.

The people I'll call "vaxx-choice" believe that their immune systems
will handle the virus just like their immune systems handle everything
else that is thrown its way. They'll possibly get COVID-19, and they'll
also possibly (although it's a slim chance) end up in the hospital.
There is also the possibility that they will die. They accept this
possibility. This group also includes people who have already contracted
COVID-19 and have antibodies against the virus naturally, and don't
believe they should need to get the vaccine.

By this point in time, people should all have heard that COVID-19
exists. They should know that it causes upper respiratory issues. It can
hospitalize you, and it can kill you. They also are fully aware that a
vaccine exists, but it has not been approved by the FDA. The FDA has
granted it an "Emergency Use Authorization" **which is not a full
approval.** The vaccine is only temporarily approved to use with
patient's consent, knowing that it has only been anecdotally tested.
Full-scale testing is ongoing, and the people being tested are the
people who have received the vaccine. Yes, for every one of us who got
the vaccine, we are in the test group. The vaccine is being tested on
us. Don't believe me? You mean you didn't get information about the
[[CDC's v-safe
program](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ac9d33&url=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafe.html){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="cdc.gov"}]{.qlink_container} when you got the vaccine?
They're watching you for symptoms and to see if you develop COVID-19.

Additionally, recently there have been spikes in disease activity. There
is a Delta variant out there as well. What we've learned is that
[[nearly all of the new COVID deaths are among the
unvaccinated](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=82cbab&url=https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-941fcf43d9731c76c16e7354f5d5e187){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="apnews.com"}]{.qlink_container}. What we don't know is what
percentage of those infections are in people who have already had
COVID-19 and got better. In other words, we don't know if any of these
people had it and got it again.

From that article:

> An Associated Press analysis of available government data from May
> shows that "breakthrough" infections in fully vaccinated people
> accounted for fewer than 1,200 of more than 107,000 COVID-19
> hospitalizations. That's about 1.1%.
>
> And only about 150 of the more than 18,000 COVID-19 deaths in May were
> in fully vaccinated people. That translates to about 0.8%, or five
> deaths per day on average.

None of the previous was opinion. It is all fact. Regardless, these
facts tell us two things.

- If you don't want to get COVID-19 and you haven't had it yet, get the
  vaccine.
- If you have the vaccine, the chances are literally slim to none that
  you'll get sick with it.

There are some anecdotal reports of some businesses not offering sick
time to account for the side effects of the vaccine, which can take a
few days from which to recover, and this is causing some hesitancy
amongst some to get the vaccine, but the vast majority who haven't
gotten the vaccine are "vaxx-choicers" using my definitions from the
above.

So the question now becomes: **why are vaxx-choicers not getting the
vaccine?**

Nearly all of them fully understand everything we've already pointed
out. They fully understand that you risk dying by not getting the
vaccine. They also fully know that if you're vaccinated, your risk of
getting the virus is virtually zero.

**They don't care.**

They also believe that the government hasn't really acted in the most
trustworthy way throughout the course of the pandemic. The government
has not been completely forthright with all of the information it had,
and they question the government's motivations in all things, not just
vaccinations.

In other words, **they don't trust the government.**

Trump is literally just pointing out the obvious: some people just don't
trust the government. But he never told people to not be vaccinated; in
fact, he's been out there saying that people should get vaccinated. He
also said that the vaccine was safe, and that's not necessarily true.
The only thing we can say for sure is that the vaccine is safer than
COVID for some people. The virus literally has a 99.8% survivability
rate. Can we truthfully say the same thing about what will happen 20
years down the road after a COVID vaccination? However, we do know that
for today, for the vulnerable population, the vaccine is marginally
safer than COVID infection.

And the only way you can protect **yourself** from COVID is the vaccine.

Whether or not you choose to risk infection is entirely up to you. It's
not up to anyone else. The "vaxxers" believe that it's up to **you** to
keep **them** safe. That's illogical. That's not how we do healthcare in
this country. We don't keep you safe by making sure that no one around
you can get sick. We keep you safe by making sure that you can't get
sick. Like everything in this country, with very few exceptions,
healthcare is an individual choice. And the choice about whether or not
to be vaccinated is also an individual choice.

**TL;DR:** Trump is basically pointing out the obvious, that some people
just don't trust the government.

\

Original question:

Trump issued a statement saying: \"People are refusing to take the
vaccine because they don\'t trust his (Biden\'s) Administration, and
they don\'t trust the election results\" Just how dangerous is this kind
of rhetoric, when Trump makes this comparison?
