**Content:** [As quickly as you can sign the papers and pay the filing
fees.\
\
However, if you expect to get alimony, some states require that you have
to have been married for a certain period of time first.\
\
Most states award \"rehabilitative alimony\" which means that the court
wants to make sure a spouse gets back on his/her feet after a divorce.
Regardless of the length of the marriage, the requesting spouse\'s
ablity to get back into the workplace will ultimately determine whether
or not, and to what extent, alimony will be awarded.\
\
To the best of my knowledge, only California and Texas require a
marriage to be a certain length before awarding
alimony.]{.rendered_qtext}
