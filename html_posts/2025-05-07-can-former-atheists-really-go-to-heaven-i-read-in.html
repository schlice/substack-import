title: "Can former atheists really go to heaven? I read in the Bible that the one unforgivable sin is to speak against the Holy Spirit. I was once an atheist but now believe greatly in God and Jesus. Am I still condemned?"

The "unforgivable sin" was *blaspheming against the Holy Spirit.*

The only time it was committed was when Jesus performed miracles in
front of Jewish leaders, they saw the miracles, they *knew the miracles
came from God*, but they **intentionally** claimed that Jesus' power to
perform miracles came from Satan.

**This** is the unforgivable sin.

Since no one today can watch Jesus performing miracles and then speak
out against those miracles, instead attributing them to Satan, no one
alive today can commit the unforgivable sin.

\

In other words, ***anyone who repents and believes can be saved. Anyone.
No sin is too great to be forgiven.***

Period. Full stop.
