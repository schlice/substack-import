**Will the Senate go along with the House which is set to vote and
increase the stimulus checks from \$600 to \$2,000, in the bill already
signed, as demanded by President Trump?**

What? MSN got it wrong? There's a surprise.

There was already a separate bill in the works which would increase the
\$600 payments to \$2000. It will also start Congressional
investigations into voting fraud, and will repeal Section 230 of the
Communications Decency Act, holding big tech site owners responsible for
the content they curate.

So with that agreement (that they would pass the follow-on bill), he
signed the first bill to keep the government running, provide small
business loans, and give the \$600 initial checks, and then the add-on
bill will add an additional \$1400 in relief checks.
