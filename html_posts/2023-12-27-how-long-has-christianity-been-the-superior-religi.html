The problem with your question is that you are both asking a question
and making a statement at the same time.

It's like the prosecutor asking the defendant, "When did you stop
beating your wife?"

Literally, the only thing you can conclusively say about Christianity is
that it is the ***largest*** religion in terms of followers, with 31% of
the world's population, or 2.382 billion. The next most populous
religion is Islam with 24.9% of the world's population, or 1.907
billion.

Calling it "the superior religion" is a matter of opinion.
