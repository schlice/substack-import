**Why do so many people in the US fight against \"income inequality\"
without ever specifying what \"income equality\" should look like?**

Because they have no idea why "income inequality" is bad. They have been
told that it's unfair that some people have so much more wealth than
others, that only a very small percentage of us --- the 1% --- is very
rich, while the rest of us are not. They've been told that it's unfair
that the income gap between the 1% and the rest of us, even the middle
class, is so large.

The only problem with these criticisms: ***they're wrong****.*

Take literally five minutes out of your life and watch this video. If
you don't want to watch the video, I'll paste the transcript below it so
you can read it instead.

> *There's only one problem with this complaint.*
>
> *It's wrong.*
>
> *Income inequality is actually a good thing \-- when it is the product

>
> *And your own life proves it!*
>
> *An economy is made up of millions of individuals making decisions
> about their own lives -- where and how much they want to work, what
> they want to buy, and so on.*
>
> *You are one of those individuals.*
>
> *In a country like the United States, you are free to pursue a path in
> life that you believe best suits your talents. That talent might be
> teaching, or making music, or banking, or starting a small business,
> or raising a family. Whatever it is, this freedom helps to make life
> enjoyable, exciting and meaningful.*
>
> *But it's also an expression of inequality. This is simply because
> we're all different. We have different talents, different
> temperaments, different ambitions.*
>
> *That's okay because -- again in a free society -- we can seek out
> opportunities that play to our personal strengths; that distinguish us
> from others.*

> *As long as you have the freedom to guide your own destiny, you have a

>
> *Forced equality means less opportunity to pursue what makes you
> individually great.*
>
> *But what about the growing gap between the rich, the 1%, and the rest
> of us, the 99%, that one hears so much about? Isn't that a bad thing?*
>
> *Again, the answer is no.*
>
> *Here's why:*
>
> *In a free market economy people become wealthy making what the rich
> enjoy today into something almost everybody can enjoy tomorrow. The
> rich are the test buyers.*
>
> *Consider the cell phone. Now we all have them, but when Motorola
> manufactured the first one in 1983 it was the size of a brick, had a
> half-hour of battery life, reception was terrible, and calls were very
> expensive. It cost \$4000. But if no one had bought that \$4000 brick,
> there wouldn't be a \$40 cell phone today.*
>
> *In the 1960's a computer cost over a million dollars. Nowadays,

> computers that cost us a few hundred dollars.*
>
> *Remember what an out-of-reach luxury flat screen TV's once were? Only

>
> *The free market is about turning scarcity into abundance. What was
> once available to the few is now available to the many. Wealth
> inequality is an important corollary to that truth.*
>
> *So, should I resent the people who became wealthy because they have

> that allows them to enrich my life and the lives of millions of other
> people?*
>
> *This feature of the free market -- income inequality -- can appear
> terribly unfair. But with a little further investigation, the real
> picture becomes clear. Income inequality makes what once seemed like
> impossible luxuries available to almost everyone; it provides the
> incentive for creative people to gamble on new ideas; it promotes
> personal freedom, and rewards hard work, talent, and achievement.*
>
> *In sum, income inequality signals that individual liberty,
> opportunity, and innovation are all present in a free economy. Pretty
> good for something that's supposed to be so bad.*
>
> *Two final points:*

> *The 1% Club is always open to new members. And you don't have to be
