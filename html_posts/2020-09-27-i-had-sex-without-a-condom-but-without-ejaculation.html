**I had sex without a condom but without ejaculation inside, however I
have a delay of 15 days and I lost pink discharge 1 day. Am I pregnant
even though I have not ejaculated anything inside of me?**

First of all, no one on the Internet can tell you if you're pregnant. Go
down to the local Walmart or your local drugstore and buy an early
pregnancy test.

Now, you should know this stuff before you have sex, but what's done is
done. You can learn it now. When the male begins intercourse, there is a
small amount of semen on the tip of the penis. It is called
*pre-ejaculate,* or *precum*. The fluid is produced by a pair of
pea-sized glands called the Cowper's glands, located near the urethra,
the tube in the penis with a dual purpose: allowing urine and semen to
exit the body. Pre-ejaculate fluid neutralizes any acidity left by urine
in the urethra, protecting sperm that flows through.

But here's the kicker: *precum can also contain sperm.*

So it is entirely possible to get pregnant without him ejaculating. It's
not likely, but it's possible.
