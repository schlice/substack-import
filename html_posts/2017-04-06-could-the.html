The "Biden Rule" basically is a quote of then-Senator Joe Biden who, in
a speech in 1992, stated that if there were to be a Supreme Court seat
that became vacant over that summer, then-President Bush should wait
until the election to appoint a replacement, or appoint a moderate who
would be acceptable to the then-Democratic Congress.

Since there is currently a hotly contested debate as to whether or not
the Constitution requires the Senate to hold hearings on the President's
nominee to the Supreme Court "in a timely manner," if there was a desire
to codify the "Biden Rule," it would likely need to be an Amendment to
the Constitution, clarifying Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 (known as
the Appointments Clause):

> *He \[the President\] shall have the Power, by and with the Advice and
> Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two-thirds of the
> Senators present concur; and he shall nominate, and by and with the
> Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other
> public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all
> other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein
> otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law: but the
> Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers as
> they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in
> the Heads of Departments.*

The phrase that everyone is confused about is "by and with the Advice
and Consent of the Senate". In practice, the expedient nomination of
Supreme Court justices has been inconsistent at best. There is nothing
written in the Constitution which describes just how fast an appointment
must be heard. And what constitutes "advice and consent?" If the Senate
tells the President that the next President should make the appointment,
does that fulfill the Senate's responsibilities for providing advice?

The short answer is that we don't know, and there has been no clear and
consistent "precedent." Some legal scholars simply cite the numbers (24
instances where presidents in their last year of a term have made SCOTUS
appointments, and the Senate has confirmed 21 of them), as well as the
fact that delaying an appointment while cases are pending could create a
"constitutional crisis." Scholars with the opposing view cite the text
of the Constitution, arguing that there is no historical or written
basis to support the claim that the Senate has a Constitutional
obligation to promptly vote on every Presidential nominee presented to
them. They also point to the 2016 election, and the importance of the
appointment of a Supreme Court justice in the minds of the voters,
knowing that the next nominee could swing the political makeup of the
Court, and affect rulings for decades. The appointment of the next
Justice was almost as important as job creation and retention in the
minds of voters, meaning it was (to them) the right decision to leave
the appointment to the next President.

**TL;DR: We probably will not be able to overcome this particular issue
without a Constitutional Amendment clarifying the Appointments Clause.**
