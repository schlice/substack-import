**Content:** [My dad was working a beat on Long Island in the 80s, and
was called to a DV in which he was facing a known drug abuser (many
dealings with this particular individual), so they knew him, knew he was
a good kid at heart, and they did not want to shoot him. But he was
exactly that individual: running down the sidewalk at full steam,
carrying a knife that he had just used to stab his girlfriend, and
refusing to stop. Remember, this is before TASERs. Pepper spray had no
effect on him; he was huge (muscular, not fat) and was high. The police
made the decision **not** to shoot him, even though he fully met the
criteria for a clean shoot.\
\
My dad lined up on the sidewalk against his advancing run, commanding
him to stop (which he did not do), and when he got within swinging
distance, he swung his 4 D-cell Mag-Light against the bridge of the
suspect\'s nose. This snapped his head back, splashed his nose across
his face, but did not stop him. He kept on running. Yeah, heroin will do
that. By the way, this was the only time in his career that he ever
commandeered a vehicle: he stopped a passing motorist to take him down
the block to set him up against the suspect\'s run.\
\
They tried using a pursuing cruiser to stop him by putting it up onto
the sidewalk at a 45 degree angle in his path, which caused him to run
into the front quarter panel, somersault over the hood of the cruiser,
land on his feet, and keep on trucking.\
\
Eventually, it took an officer of similar size to football tackle him,
and took an additional officer **on each limb** to secure him, a set of
handcuffs on each wrist which were locked together to restrain him. They
were still allowed to hog-tie at that time (the concerns about
positional asphyxiation not well known then), and he was hog-tied and
taken to county lockup to sleep it off.]{.rendered_qtext}
