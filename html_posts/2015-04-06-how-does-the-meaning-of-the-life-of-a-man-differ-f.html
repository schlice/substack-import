**Content:** [The difference is consciousness.\
\
The fly exists fulfilling unthought primal urges. Eat. Avoid being
eaten. Make baby flies. Repeat. The fly does not \"think,\" it just
\"does.\" It therefore has no awareness of self. It is alive because of
the definition of life. But it is not \"alive.\"\
\
The man has consciousness; he is aware of his existence. Because of this
awareness, he now understands that he is \"alive,\" and that at some
point in the future he will not be. Therefore, his life must derive some
meaning beyond that of the fly, so he examines his life searching for
meaning. He says, \"The unexamined life is not worth living.\"
(Specifically, Socrates said that, but I digress). He therefore is the
only creature that must define meaning from life. William Hazlitt
(another man) said, \"Man is the only animal that laughs and weeps, for
he is the only animal that is struck with the difference between what
things are and what they ought to be.\" And George Eliot (yet another
man) said, \"It is never too late to be who you might have been.\"
Finally, John Ruskin (yep, another man) said, \"The highest reward for a
man\'s toil is not what he gets for it, but what he becomes by it.\"\
\
These men sought to understand why they were alive, and somehow create,
and thus derive, some meaning from their lives.]{.rendered_qtext}
