First of all, you didn't know they had an allergy. If it was an
accident, then you did not intend to harm them. Accidents do happen.
Unless you're asking because you really did know they have an allergy,
in which case you were trying to harm them. Only you can answer that
question.

Second, people with allergies need to take some responsibility for
themselves and ask if the food contains whatever they are allergic to
before they eat it.
