**Why do right wingers deny the constitutionality of "separation of
church and state"?**

Perhaps if you could show me where, in the Constitution, it says
"separation of church and state," then I'd be less inclined to deny the
Constitutionality of that statement.

But I can't seem to find it in the Constitution, which makes it really
easy to deny the constitutionality of the phrase.
