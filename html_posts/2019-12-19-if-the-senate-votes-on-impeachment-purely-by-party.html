**If the Senate votes on impeachment purely by party, how can the
American people ever trust the process?**

The process was broken when the House passed purely partisan Articles of
Impeachment without performing a full and complete investigation.

They did not vote on a full investigative panel, as other impeachments
have. They did it all in subcommittees, controlled by partisans.

They did not compel the Executive to comply with Congressional
subpoenas. They simply ignored exculpatory evidence which may have been
presented by those witnesses, and proceeded along hoping you wouldn't
notice.

They did not conduct all investigations and all interviews in full and
open sessions, available to all members, and with transcripts available
to the full House.

The process was an unprecedented partisan dog-and-pony show,
masquerading as an impeachment inquiry.

And if the House can send partisan Articles to the Senate, the Senate
can vote on them in a partisan way, too.
