**If the FDA says marijuana is illegal, can Congress actually vote to
make it legal or does the FDA have final say?**

First off, the FDA works for Congress. Congress built that agency (along
with all Federal agencies) for their convenience.

Secondly, it's the Federal Controlled Substances Act, which was passed
by Congress, which makes marijuana illegal. A Federal agency did not
implement a random rule which made marijuana illegal, and even if they
did, Congress can still override it. Congress can simply vote to change
the Controlled Substances Act to move marijuana either to a different
schedule, or remove it altogether.
