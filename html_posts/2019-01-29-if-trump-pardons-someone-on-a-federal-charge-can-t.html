**If Trump pardons someone on a federal charge, can that same charge be
made at a state level, under state law?**

I see a lot of incorrect answers here. The correct answer is ***yes,***
a state can charge someone for violation of the state crime even after
the Federal government has completed its prosecution, and this does not
violate the "double jeopardy" clause of the 5th Amendment.

The legal theory under which this can take place is called "*dual
sovereignty*." If two overlapping sovereigns (Federal and state) have
laws which make something illegal (let's use murder as an example), both
sovereigns can separately charge that crime and it is not considered to
be double jeopardy.

Therefore, to answer the question, if Trump pardons someone from a
Federal charge, a state is free to charge that person for the same crime
if it can be charged under state law. Very few of these individual
charges are chargeable at both the Federal and state levels; taxes are
paid separately to the Federal government and the state, so if you
failed to pay state tax appropriately, you can be charged by the state,
but the Federal government can't charge you for failing to pay state
taxes, so it's not the same charge.

If, however, one of Trump's staff were charged with murder, and that
murder could also be charged by the state, then a Federal pardon would
not exonerate the person at the state level.
