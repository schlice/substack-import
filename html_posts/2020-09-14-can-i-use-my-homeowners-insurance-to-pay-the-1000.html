**Can I use my homeowners insurance to pay the \$1,000 deductible for
damage done to my car, parked in my assigned parking space in the condo
building's parking lot? My auto insurance covered the damage.**

Generally, homeowner's or renter's insurance cannot be used to pay
deductibles. You may have separate gap coverage (i.e. AFLAC) which might
cover deductibles, but in general, insurance can't be used to pay
deductibles.

The deductible is the amount you must pay before insurance will pay. You
can always choose a lower deductible and higher monthly premiums, but
the deductible is the way risk is shared between you and the insurance
company. So the deductible is on you to pay.

If your insurance reimburses you for the damage done to your car, they
will simply deduct your deductible from what they reimburse, so in
function, you don't necessarily have to "pay" your deductible out of
your pocket in most cases. There are a small subset of cases where you
may have to put that money down, but one way or another (either out of
pocket or out of your reimbursement), you will pay your deductible.
