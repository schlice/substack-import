The problem with your argument is that Option A (buying a gun legally)
isn\'t available to Joe, so he buys a gun illegally, which is cheaper
and easier, than buying one legally. Adding the background check only
sent Joe to the black market. It didn\'t stop Joe from getting a gun if
he really wanted one.
