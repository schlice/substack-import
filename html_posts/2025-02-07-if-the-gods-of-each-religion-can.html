This is a very popular Western viewpoint. All religions are right. All
religions are just "different paths up the same mountain." It's a
concept that greatly appeals to the broadly tolerant American mind. In
America, truth in religion is considered an oxymoron. There is no truth
in religion, we are told. It's all a matter of taste or opinion. You
like chocolate, I like vanilla. You like Christianity, I like Islam. If
Buddhism works for you, then it's true for you. Besides, you ought not
judge me for my beliefs!

But this is *incorrect*.

How do we know? Religions teach opposite things, and two opposite things
cannot be true at the same time. For example, Christianity teaches that
Jesus rose from the dead. Islam teaches that Jesus never died. Only one
of these is correct. They can't both be correct. Christianity teaches
that Jesus is God. Judaism teaches that Jesus was a prophet, a really
great one, but He wasn't God. Only one of these can be right. They can't
both be right.

Also, there can't be more than one infinite being. There can only be one
infinite being, because in order for two beings to be distinct and
different from each other, one must have something that the other lacks.
But an infinite being lacks nothing. So you can't have more than one
infinite God.

At some point, you're going to have to realize the truth that truth
exists, and there is only one truth and everything opposed to it is
false.

What truth will *you* believe?
