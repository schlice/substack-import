The Note 4 already runs on the T-Mobile network. If the phone runs on
the AT&T network (which it does), it runs on the T-Mobile network. They
both use GSM networks, and any phone of the Note's build quality will
use multiple GSM frequencies, and both carriers use multiple GSM
frequencies.

You could unlock an AT&T Note 4 and use it on the T-Mobile network if
you have one.

HOWEVER

You can't use a Verizon Note 4 on the T-Mobile network, as Verizon's
phones are CDMA and T-Mobile's phones are GSM. The tech is totally
different. Not only do GSM phones have a different wireless radio, CDMA
phones are not SIM card capable. GSM phones use SIM cards, so it's more
than just changing a radio.
