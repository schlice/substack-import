In addition to the great GI Bill options you're hearing about here, if
you are not yet in the military, you might be able to get into Army ROTC
in your college (if they offer it) and there are scholarships available
if you go that route. Once you complete college, you'll be commissioned
as a 2LT in the Army Reserves.

So it's the same thing, just in reverse (college first, then the Army
Reserves).
