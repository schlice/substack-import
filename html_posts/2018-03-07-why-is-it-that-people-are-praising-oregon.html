**Why is it that people are praising Oregon\'s \"New\" gun law, when
many states like Colorado have had this law for decades? Isn\'t it
federal law that domestic abuse is a reason to fail a background
check?**

Looks like a little media sensationalism here. Clearly, it's only the
first "new" law since the Parkland shooting, but you're right, Colorado
has barred DV convicts from owning guns. The new Oregon law also bars
people who are convicted of "stalking" from owning guns. M'kay.
Anywaaaaay, the new feature of the law allows Oregon to **seize existing
guns** from people convicted of domestic violence or stalking.

Which makes our point about the second question: **Isn\'t it federal law
that domestic abuse is a reason to fail a background check?**

Indeed it is. Under 18 USC **ยง** 922 (d)(9), you fail a background check
if you've been convicted of DV.

But what if you already own a gun, you are unaffected. You simply can't
buy a **new** gun.

Oregon's law allows them to seize existing guns from those convicted of
domestic violence or stalking, just as Colorado does (minus the stalking
thing).
