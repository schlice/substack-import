**What other judges will the Republicans nominate to the Supreme Court
if Kavanaugh does not get confirmed?**

The list is already out there. We've been talking about the other
candidates before the President announced that Kavanaugh would be the
nominee. Rather than me re-typing the list which is freely available on
the Big I, I'll reproduce it here for you.

> **Amy Coney Barrett** of Indiana, U.S. Court of Appeals for the
> Seventh Circuit, 46. She previously clerked for the late Supreme Court
> Justice Antonin Scalia. She was appointed by Trump and confirmed to
> the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in October 2017.
>
> She is a graduate of Notre Dame Law School.
>
> Barrett is reportedly one of four candidates who Trump interviewed on
> Monday. Popular among religious conservatives, she would be the fifth
> woman to serve on the Supreme Court.
>
> **Keith Blackwell** of Georgia, Supreme Court of Georgia, 42. He was
> appointed to the Supreme Court of Georgia in July 2012 after
> previously serving on the Court of Appeals of Georgia.
>
> He served as a clerk for Judge J.L. Edmondson of the United States
> Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit after graduating from
> University of Georgia School of Law.
