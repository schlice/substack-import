The same way we know about other ancient events which we claim happened
a long time ago.

**Recorded history.**

And these recordings aren't even by Christians! There are ten known
non-Christian writers who mention Jesus within 150 years of His life.

When you add those non-Christian writings to the Christian sources over
that same 150 years, there are about as many sources who mention Jesus
as mention Tiberius Caesar, the Roman emperor at the time of Jesus.

So we have as much proof that Jesus was crucified as we have that
Tiberius Caesar was the Roman emperor at the same time. Yet we have no
trouble believing that Tiberius existed and was actually the emperor of
Rome.

In fact, based on just the information from the ten non-Christian (some
might even be considered *anti-Christian*) sources, we know the
following about Jesus:

1.  Jesus lived during time of Tiberius Caesar.
2.  He lived a virtuous life.
3.  He was a wonder-worker.
4.  He had a brother named James.
5.  He was acclaimed to be the Messiah.
6.  He was crucified under Pontius Pilate.
7.  He was crucified on the eve of the Jewish Passover.
8.  Darkness and an earthquake occurred when he died.
9.  His disciples believed He rose from the dead.
10. His disciples were willing to die for their belief.
11. Christianity spread rapidly as far as Rome.
12. His disciples denied the Roman gods and worshiped Jesus as
    God.[\[1\]](#XRZCY){#cite-XRZCY .citation_link}
