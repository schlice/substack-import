The phrase "do not cast pearls before swine" was part of the Sermon on
the Mount. Jesus was teaching about many things we know about, like "do
not judge, lest you be judged" and "first take the plank out of your own
eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your
brother's eye."

But then in verse 6, Jesus tempers this guidance, telling us that we
must learn the difference between "judgement" and "discernment" so that
we can discern the swine and not cast our pearls before them without
being hypocritical judges ourselves.

Jesus gives the same guidance to the apostles elsewhere in the New
Testament when He says, "If anyone will not welcome you or listen to
your words, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that home or
town" (Matthew 10:14).

In other words, we are told to share the gospel, but when it becomes
apparent that the gospel is not welcome, move on. We should not persist
in trying to share the gospel when it is clear through our discernment
that the gospel will only be met with ridicule.

But remember, that doesn't mean that we shouldn't share the gospel at
all. We are responsible to share the good news; we are not responsible
for how others receive it. Swine don't appreciate pearls, just as some
people don't appreciate what Christ has done for them. Our job is not to
convert them. Our job is to deliver the message; it is God who does the
hard work of conversion. Not all will be saved, but that doesn't change
our resolve in ensuring everyone has an opportunity to hear that
message.
