Cops are still using alwyas-on RADAR. It\'s built in to many patrol
cars, so why not use it? Special stings will still take place using
instant-on RADAR guns and LIDAR, but those constant-on units are still
built in to many patrol cars, so it will still be used.

Additionally, RADAR detectors can absolutely detect \"splash\" from
other cars; even instant-on and LIDAR can be detected if it\'s hitting
other cars in front of you. So RADAR detectors are still useful, even
against instant-on and LIDAR. You just have to be vigilant.

And as [[David
Rosen](https://www.quora.com/profile/David-Rosen-5)]{.qlink_container}
mentioned, using them in conjunction with Waze or ESCORT Live will up
your chances. Finally, you\'ve probably noticed that your RADAR detector
is going off constantly these days as you drive around. That\'s because
most modern cars that have \"blind-spot warning\" systems and other
driver-assist systems use RADAR, and your detector picks that up.

Escort and Valentine systems (as far as I know) have built-in logic to
detect these in-car driver-assist systems and filter them out. If
you\'re going to get a RADAR detector, get a good one. Don\'t waste your
money on a cheap one.
