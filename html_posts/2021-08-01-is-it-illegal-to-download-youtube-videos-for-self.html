"Illegal" implies that the practice somehow violates copyright law, or
that you could be arrested or fined by doing so. Whether or not you are
allowed to view the video is determined by copyright. YouTube has
granted you, the YouTube user, the right to view the movie on their
platform. They have not granted you the right to download the video to
watch offline.

Therefore, it is a violation of YouTube's terms of service to do so. You
deprive YouTube of its ad revenue. But "illegal?" No, it is not illegal
to download a YouTube video.

In some cases (like VEVO videos produced by artists), YouTube pays the
distribution company a fee based on the number of views a video gets. If
you download the video for offline viewing, YouTube has no idea of that
view count, and the artist gets shorted. So you are, in effect, stealing
from the artist. While no one will ever come after you for doing so,
theft is theft, regardless of how small it is.

So it's more "immoral" than "illegal."

Original question:

Is it still illegal to download YouTube videos for myself?
