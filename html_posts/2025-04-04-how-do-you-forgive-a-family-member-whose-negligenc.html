You realize that forgiveness isn't about you forgiving them. **It's
about you forgiving** ***yourself*.**

Let me explain with an analogy.

Let's assume you are out fishing with your family member. Let's also
assume that while they are casting their line, they get the hook stuck
in your cheek.

What can you do about this grave injustice?

You could ignore it. You go home and go to bed, but when you wake up the
next morning, *the pain is worse*.

You could complain about it. "Look at me! Look how much my family member
has hurt me!" But that doesn't reduce the pain, either, because the hook
is still in your cheek, and it still hurts.

What is the clear, obvious choice? *Remove the hook!*

When you refuse to forgive, you leave the hook in your cheek. Deep down,
you might be thinking that if you forgive them, you're letting them off
the hook. But the truth is that while you don't forgive them (while you
leave the hook in your cheek), *they're still hurting you*. If you
*don't* forgive them, **you are the one with the hook still in you**.

Forgiveness is for your sake, not theirs. You need to forgive them so
that you can move on. You are not hurting them by staying hooked to the
pain. That's like drinking poison and hoping the other person dies. You
must forgive them so that you can move on without pain.

\

But by the same token, part of forgiving is *agreeing to live with the
consequences of someone else's mistakes*. You might say, "But that's not
fair!" No, it is not. But you'll have to do it anyway. The only choice
we do have is whether we do it in the bondage of bitterness, or in the
freedom of forgiveness.

You must **choose** to forgive. And in making that choice, you must
agree to live with their mistakes and the consequences of those
mistakes.

**Forgiveness is to set a captive free, and then to realize that you
were the captive.**

Forgiveness is a crisis of the will. If you wait until you feel like
doing it, you never will. The reality is that you have a choice to make.
You must face the hurt. You must face the hate. You must choose to not
hold their mistakes against them for the rest of your life. And that's
hard. But you must do it. Say it out loud. Declare to yourself that you
know they hurt you, but you are going to forgive them and not hold it
against them.

Are you going to remain in bitterness, hooked to the past, or are you
going to get rid of the pain once and for all? Are you going to do
what's necessary to remove that hook from your cheek?

*By the way, I kept this answer entirely secular. But there is a
spiritual aspect to this. I can expound on that if you'd like, just let
me know. But I wanted to present it in an entirely secular way if you
are not spiritual.*
