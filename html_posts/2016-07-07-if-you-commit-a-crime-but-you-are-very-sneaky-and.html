Interesting discussion. It's a variant of "If a tree falls in the woods
and there's no one there to hear it, did it make a sound?" In other
words, does sound only have a quality, as such, if it is interpreted by
someone hearing it?

To get back to the original question, "If you commit a crime but you
were not caught, did you still commit a crime?"

The legal answer is, most emphatically, **yes**. There is no objective
standard in the law which requires conviction of a crime in order to
commit a crime.

But, you might counter, you're only a felon if you get caught.

That is precisely accurate. You are only considered a "felon" if you are
caught, charged, tried, and convicted of a felony.

You can commit a crime and you may never be arrested, charged, tried,
and/or convicted, and the crime still took place. There was still a
victim (even in a "victimless crime," society in general is worse off
after the crime). The law does not require that you be caught in order
for a crime to have been committed.

This is the only standard we can use to determine this. Now, it may seem
to you that if you are never caught, then no crime was committed. Not
so. You are never brought to justice if you are never caught, but the
crime stands. All you would need is evidence and a willing prosecutor
and you can be brought to justice. Being held to account for your crime
is not a necessary part of the crime; it is not one of the elements
required in order to create a crime. A simple violation of the law as
written is all that is needed to commit a crime.

Here's an example. In around 2000, "someone" stole my personal
information and opened two credit cards in my name. They rang up over
\$12,000 in debt on those cards and then stopped paying on them. I was
left with the bill and the negative credit report. When the police
investigation started catching up with the person, he/she transferred
the balances off of those cards onto other cards. The credit card
companies removed the negative credit entries as the cards were
determined to be fraudulent. The detectives had enough evidence to
charge this person with two felony counts: possession of two or more
financial transaction devices (a Class 4 felony in Colorado), and
unlawful use of a financial transaction device (any amount over \$10,000
is a Class 4 felony in Colorado). However, the district attorney decided
not to prosecute the case. At the time, identity theft wasn't the
fastest growing crime in the world. The prosecutor was fairly certain he
could not get a jury to convict this person, given their standing in the
community, their history of stellar community service, and the fact that
there was no longer a victim (the money had all been repaid). So did the
crime take place? Yes. Was the criminal caught? No. The crime does not
need to be prosecuted in order to have been committed.
