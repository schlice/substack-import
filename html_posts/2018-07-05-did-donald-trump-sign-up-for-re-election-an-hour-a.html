**Is it true that Donald Trump signed up for re-election an hour after
his inauguration?**

According to the Washington Compost:

> On the same day that Donald Trump assumed his new office, he also

> Election Commission on Friday.
>
> Because Trump's campaign committee has been steadily raising money

Drudge leaked that the President was going to announce his candidacy in
February 2018, which would have made it officially the earliest
announcement for a president to announce a re-election campaign, but
there is no evidence that the president has officially or formally
announced his candidacy for 2020.
