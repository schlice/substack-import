I love answering questions like this, because the words you choose for
your question reveal your own biases.

The prophesies which seem silly to you were written thousands of years
before Jesus was born, yet He fulfilled them all in His lifetime. Many
of those things were beyond His control, like where He was born or who
his family was. The mathematical probability of that happening by random
chance is *so low* that is is virtually impossible.

And that "silly" book is actually 66 books, written by 40 different
authors over the course of 1500 years, in three different languages, on
three different continents. Yet there is unity in the story, and there
are no errors or conflicts between any of them. It is *literally*
impossible for humans to pull that off without divine intervention.

So is it really all that silly that these books and prophesies so
clearly reveal God's divine intervention?

\

As for His intervention into "sentient beings' problems," nothing
"happens" naturally (which I assume you mean by random chance).
Everything has a cause. God will fulfill His plan, whether you like it
or not. If you are one of His, He will fulfill His plans through you.
And even if you are not one of His, He will still fulfill His plans
through you and you won't ever know it or be a part of it.

Since He's going to fulfill His plans in your life one way or the other
whether you like it or not, doesn't it make more sense to do it *with*
Him rather than *against* Him? I should think that would make for a
better life, living in harmony with God's will rather than constantly
opposed to it.
