In most cases, a crime can be prevented with a handgun ***without anyone
firing a single shot.*** Just the **mere presence** of a handgun is
oftentimes enough to stop a crime before it occurs.

A bulletproof vest only works if you're wearing it, and if someone
shoots at you. Therefore, the mere presence of a bulletproof vest does
not routinely prevent a crime from happening.

Therefore, the two items being compared (a bulletproof vest and a
handgun) are not equal.
