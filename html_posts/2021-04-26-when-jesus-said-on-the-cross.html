Jesus was not forgiving all people for all time without repentance and
faith with that statement. He was forgiving the people who persecuted
him, so that he could fulfill Old Testament prophecy: "He bore the sin
of many, and made intercession for the transgressors" (Isaiah 53:12).
Even on the cross, he forgave sinners.

Also important was that they did not know what they were doing. They had
no idea how important their part in history was.

Jesus' statement on the cross was indeed the very beginning of
forgiveness for all who believe in him.

> even as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give
> his life as a ransom for many. --- Matthew 20:28 NIV

Original question:

When Jesus said on the cross "Father forgive them for they know not what
they do", was that the very beginning of redemption for all humanity if
people seek him first?
