So there's a bit to this question, let's break it down.

This is a question and a statement.

- **Why don\'t all Christians teach non-violence and non-resistance with
  no exceptions?**

Because the Bible doesn't say that at all. And the assertion that
follows it, "It is what Jesus clearly taught, and what Christians
believed until Constantine came along**"** is simply untrue. The Bible
shows Jesus actually using violence when it was appropriate:

> *The Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
> In the temple he found those who were selling oxen and sheep and
> pigeons, and the money-changers sitting there. And making a whip of
> cords, he drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and oxen.
> And he poured out the coins of the money-changers and overturned their
> tables. And he told those who sold the pigeons, "Take these things
> away; do not make my Father's house a house of trade." \-- John
> 2:13--16 ESV*

Yes, you read that right. Jesus fashioned himself a "whip of cords" and
drove the money changers out of the temple with it. Presumably, He
didn't just show it to them. Presumably, He used it. He then took all
their money and dumped it out on the floor, and overturned their tables:

Yep, that's right. If anyone ever asks you, "What would Jesus do?"
remember that flipping tables and chasing people around with whips are
within the realm of possibility.

But Jesus also taught non-violence, right?

> *"You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for
> a tooth.' But I say to you, Do not resist the one who is evil. But if
> anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. And
> if anyone would sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak
> as well. And if anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two
> miles. Give to the one who begs from you, and do not refuse the one
> who would borrow from you. \-- Matthew 5:38--42 ESV*

So what does all of this tell us?

The nonviolence that Jesus preached was *in response to what was done to
us.* We should never repay violence for violence. We should never
respond with violence just because someone was violent to us. In other
words, the nonviolence of which Jesus taught was **how to respond to
violence done to us.**

The proper use of **violence** ***in self-defense*** has to do with
wisdom, understanding, and tact. In Luke 22:36, Jesus tells His
remaining disciples the following:

> *He said to them, "But now let the one who has a moneybag take it, and
> likewise a knapsack.* ***And let the one who has no sword sell his
> cloak and buy one****." \-- Luke 22:36 ESV*

Jesus knew that the time had come when His followers would be
threatened, and He upheld their right to self-defense. However, just a
short time later, Jesus is arrested, and Peter takes a sword and cuts
off someone's ear. Jesus rebukes Peter for that act, after just
previously telling them that they should have the right to take up
swords in self-defense (verses 49--51). Why? In his zeal to defend the
Lord, Peter was standing in the way of God's will. Jesus had told His
disciples multiple times that He must be arrested, put on trial, and die
(e.g., Matthew 17:22--23). In other words, Peter acted unwisely in that
situation. We must have wisdom regarding when to fight and when not to.

> **Have we in the western world, become so attached to our earthly

Yes.

> *For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils. It is through
> this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and pierced
> themselves with many pangs. \-- 1 Tim 6:10 ESV*

Remember, it is the love of money that is the root of all kinds of evil,
**not money itself**. Placing the love of money above the love of God
creates an *idol*, and we are warned of false idols continuously
throughout the Bible.

So yes, this has been a problem not just in the western world, but all
across the world, throughout all time. The love of money causes men to
worship money, and the accumulation of it, as an idol that overtakes
their lives.
