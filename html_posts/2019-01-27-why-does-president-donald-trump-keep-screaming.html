**Why does president Donald Trump keep screaming "witch hunt" during
Mueller's investigation when most of trumps campaign staff has already
been indicted or charged?**

There are several reasons.

1.  Trump capitalizes on buzzwords. Crooked Hillary and Lyin' Ted were
    only a thing because Trump made them so. And you can't hear "Mueller
    probe" without thinking "witch hunt" somewhere in the recesses of
    your mind. It's very effective marketing.
2.  Trump is trying to keep everyone focused on the central original
    goal of the Mueller probe: Trump colluding with Russia to steal the
    election from Hillary. To this day, no one who has been charged or
    indicted has been charged or indicted with any crime even
    tangentially related to Trump colluding with Russia to steal the
    election from Hillary. So he created the buzzword "witch hunt" to
    remind people that no one has yet been charged with anything related
    to Trump colluding with Russia to steal an election.

Yes, it's true that those people committed crimes. They did fail to
register as foreign agents, and they did lie to the FBI, and they did
evade paying taxes. This is what prosecutors do. They throw the net
wide, and they see who they catch. They then sit that person down and
tell them that they're going to jail for a long time for their crime
**unless** they agree to roll over on Trump. Whether or not anyone has
done this is anyone's guess, but it is highly unlikely.

Thus, Trump calls it a witch hunt.
