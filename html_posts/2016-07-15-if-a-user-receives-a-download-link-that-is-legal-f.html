Usually, whether or not a "link" is legal depends more on the content at
the end of the link rather than the link itself. Remember that a hosting
company is not liable if a user posts content which he did not have
rights to post, so the link itself isn't really relevant. It's more
about the content.

I'm not sure if this is the exact situation you're facing, but we can't
talk about legal specifics on Quora anyway. If you have a case specific
to one person, you should talk to a lawyer. So let's **assume** you have
a link to some content. You have a purchased license to use that
content. The only way that this would be permissible is that you were
either provided a link for your own personal use (not to be distributed)
or you were somehow given a direct link to the content but you are
personally licensed to use the content separate from the link. You share
the link to thousands of users. These users do not have a license to use
that content, but through the link, they are able to access and use the
content without paying a license fee.

Sharing the link itself, since it linked directly to licensed content
and users could access the content without having to pay, would be a
DMCA violation, since you facilitated the distribution of content
without the appropriate licensing in place.

In either case, you as the distributor of the link would not be the
target of the content owner's legal action; it would be the hosting
facility since they provided unfettered access to licensed content
without restriction. The hosting facility, in turn, would provide the
original poster of the content, since that would be the person who is
ultimately responsible for posting licensed content to a distribution
site without authorization to do so. While you do certainly share
liability for the unlawful distribution of the licensed content, you
aren't likely to be the first target of the content owner; it will be
the hosting site which is allowing full access to the content itself.
The content owner will issue a DMCA take down notice to the hosting
provider, which will take the content offline.
