The lack of logic in this question is staggering. Even for a
hypothetical scenario, it's hard to wrap your brain around this one.
There are a lot of bridges to cross before you can answer honestly.

First of all, an anti-gun person would never find himself or herself in
such a situation. In order to face such a scenario, you would have to

1.  own a gun
2.  have it available to use, which means not in safe storage, or on
    your person
3.  have already gone through the mental maths justifying its use

None of these things will happen if you are anti-gun. So the situation,
on its face, is ludicrous.

Second, anyone will react the same way if they are faced with the same
scenario; logic does not override the base desire to preserve life. The
instinct for self-preservation comes from deep within the subconscious
regions of the brain, not from the upper parts of the brain, where logic
and reason operate.

So if you're pro-gun, anti-gun, man, woman, white, black, green, yellow,
brown, *whatever,* if your life is on the line, you will act to preserve
your own life. Period.
