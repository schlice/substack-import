So let\'s throw a hypothetical in here.

If you woke up one morning and found yourself trapped in a cabin with a
newborn baby, and there was no one else in the cabin, would it be
illegal to allow that baby to die without you feeding it? Assume there
is an adequate supply of baby formula is in the cabin with you (as well
as a full supply of food for you).

Most people agree that you have a moral responsibility to feed that
baby, and the laws around child neglect support this view.

Now, let\'s change the hypothetical a little bit. Instead of baby
formula, let\'s say that you are a lactating mother. That baby in the
cabin with you is not yours. *Does that change the morality of the
situation at all?*

Again, most people, at this point, still believe that because you are
the only person around who has the ability to feed that baby, and it
doesn\'t hurt you to do so, that you have a moral obligation to feed
that baby.

Why is pregnancy any different?

You are forced to feed a baby, that baby relies on you for its food and
shelter, and there is no one else near you who has the capability to
support that baby.

Some people immediately jump to a bodily autonomy argument. It\'s inside
my body, so I can choose to take it out. But morally, how is that any
different from using your body to feed that baby on the outside? You are
still providing the baby food and shelter. In fact, I would argue that
it is *more difficult* if the baby is outside, because you have to stop
what you\'re doing in order to feed the baby.

If the baby has a right to food and shelter outside of your body, why
does the baby not have the same right to food and shelter inside of your
body?

Original question:

It may be moot, but can it be argued that forcing a woman to use her
body as what Rep. Cawthorn called an \"earthen vessel\" for an unwanted
fetus for 6-7 months be considered \"involuntary servitude\" under the
14th Amendment?
