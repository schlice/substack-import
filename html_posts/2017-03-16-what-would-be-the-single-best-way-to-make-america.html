I added "Hypothetical Scenarios" to your list of topics, because this
will **never happen**. You need a Constitutional amendment to overturn
rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights (several depending on how you
want to hunt down all these guns), and a clear majority of the American
people voting for it. Not to mention the vast majority of states have
similar rights in their Constitutions, and they are independent, so
states would also have to choose to alter their own Constitutions. Since
you will never get all of this to happen, it's most definitely a
hypothetical.

The design of the United States is one that encourages *individual*
responsibility for one's own safety. Understanding this, to get rid of
civilian ownership of guns, you would have to start by making it so that
someone else is responsible for your safety. To wit: you need a police
officer for every citizen. So instead of the roughly 800,000 to
1,000,000 police officers we have nationwide now, you would need **150
times** more police officers (approximately 150 million officers). You
would then have to assign an officer to every man, woman, and child in
the country (the remaining 150 million people), to be their personal
bodyguards. In this way, the citizenry would not be responsible for
their own safety, and would not need firearms.

Maybe someday when our personal robotic assistants (think of the movie
*I, Robot* starring Will Smith) can also be our personal bodyguards, we
can remove the right of citizens to be armed. Until that day, and until
you ***fundamentally change the United States,*** firearms will always
be a part of the very foundation and fabric of this country. If you
remove a brick from the foundation, the rest of the structure is
immeasurably weakened. Firearms are a fundamental part of the foundation
of the United States. They cannot be so easily removed without
irreparably damaging the entire nation.
