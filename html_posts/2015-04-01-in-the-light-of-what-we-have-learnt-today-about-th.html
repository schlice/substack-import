**Content:** [I don\'t suspect that the rules will change. The rules are
designed to prevent non flight crew personnel from unlawfully entering
the cockpit. Anything designed to allow persons to forcibly enter the
cockpit can/will be used against the flight crew.\
\
In this case, the rules didn\'t account for *the flight crew* actually
crashing the plane.\

You can\'t account for all things that human beings will
do.]{.rendered_qtext}
