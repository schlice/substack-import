I can\'t find any citations that show it does anything but flip the pins
and register itself as a "genuine Apple\" product. I imagine that to do
much more, it would probably need to be bigger. Not to mention,
lightning is lightning. You\'re going to shoot yourself in the foot if
you\'re Apple and you require a certain brick *AND* a certain cable to
effect fast charging.

Were that the case, I would proclaim it a total failure, as Samsung can
fast charge with any Micro USB cable and the appropriate brick.
