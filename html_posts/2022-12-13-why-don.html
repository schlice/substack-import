Because sometimes theists get confused and forget that they don't need
to "make atheists believe." It's also possible that the theist has never
had any education regarding evangelism and what it actually means.

***The TL;DR: it's not the theist's job to make anyone believe.***

The theist is responsible for delivering the message. The theist is not
responsible for how the message is received. It is God who does the hard
work of conversion. It is God who sets the unbeliever's heart into a
condition into which the message can actually be received and acted
upon.

But that doesn't stop the theist from delivering the message.

Think of it this way: it's a big sales department, and the sale is
actually broken up between two sales divisions: a "pitch" division, and
a "close" division. We all work in the "pitch" division. Once we've
pitched the sale, our job is complete. The sale moves on to the "close"
division, and only God works there. It's God's responsibility to "close
the deal" and bring the person to faith.

And while sometimes God does our job, we never do His.
