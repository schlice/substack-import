**Can a citizen shoot a policeman that has trespassed a private
property?**

So are you asking when the trial is over and the officer has been found
guilty of trespassing can you take out a gun and shoot them?

No? You mean when the officer is on the property? Can you shoot them for
trespassing while they are on your property?

So clearly you can't, for multiple reasons:

1.  Trespassing isn't a situation in which you are in fear for your
    life. No one has made an overt threat on your life. Therefore, you
    can't really be defending your life or the life of your family from
    someone who hasn't threatened them. The presence of a police officer
    on your property does not, by itself, constitute a threat on your
    life.
2.  Police officers may actually have a legal right to be on your
    property that you are unaware of, which is where my humorous first
    line in my answer came from. Trespassing is a matter of law to be
    determined by a judge, not something you can determine while it is
    happening.
3.  Even if a police officer said he was coming on to your property to
    arrest you, you still can't shoot him, because he's acting under
    "color or law," which means he's doing his job. When he enters your
    property in order to do his job, he is protected from legal action
    when it is directed at his actions required by that execution of the
    law. In such a situation, he's not even technically trespassing.
