**Do you think the NRA is worried that if Trump is able to declare a
\"national emergency\" over a border wall that a future president might
declare a national emergency over gun violence?**

No, and it's clear from your question that you don't understand what a
national emergency is, what it does, and what it does not do.

A national emergency doesn't allow the President to do whatever he
wants. What the President can do is defined by the [[National
Emergencies
Act](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=eaf2df&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Emergencies_Act){.external_link

distinct statutory emergency powers the President can enact by declaring
a national emergency. He can't just go off the rails and do anything he
likes. For example, in this particular national emergency, he can enact
the emergency provisions of 10 USC § 2808(a) and authorize military
construction projects. What Federal law would they enact to do something
about gun violence? The one in bold below is likely to be the one Trump
is enacting using this current national emergency:

> Emergency presidential powers are dramatic, and range from suspending
> all laws regulating chemical and biological weapons, including the ban
> on human testing (50 U.S.C. § 1515, passed 1969); to suspending any
> Clean Air Act implementation plan or excess emissions penalty upon
> petition of a state governor (42 U.S.C. (f) § 7410 (f), passed 1977);
> **to authorizing and constructing military construction projects (10
> U.S.C. (a) § 2808 (a), passed 1982) using any existing defense
> appropriations for such military constructions (\$10.4 billion in
> FY2018);** to drafting any retired Coast Guard officers (14 U.S.C. §
> 331, passed 1963) or enlisted members (14 U.S.C. § 359, passed 1949)
> into active duty.[\[1\]](#cNlSO){#cite-cNlSO .citation_link}

So I don't think that there is any Federal law which a President could
enact using a national emergency that would have any appreciable effect
on gun violence.
