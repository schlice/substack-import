As a Christian, you accept the fact that **conversion is not your job.**

You see, in God's Conversion Department (which functions very much like
a sales team), there are two separate job functions. The first function
is the Introduction Team. That's the team that we are all on. It's our
job to make the initial contact and get the person interested in hearing
more. The second function is the Closing Team. The Closing Team is the
one that actually makes the sale. He has the hard job of doing the
actual conversion.

If you haven't realized it by now, there is only One on the Closing
Team: God.

It's our job to bring the person to God. It's God's job to "close the
deal," to keep with the analogy. God does conversions; we do not.

The Bible is pretty clear about this:

> And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within
> you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you
> a heart of flesh. --- Ezekiel 36:26 ESV

We cannot do this ourselves:

> And you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once walked,
> following the course of this world, following the prince of the power
> of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of
> disobedience---among whom we all once lived in the passions of our
> flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by
> nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind.
>
> But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he
> loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive
> together with Christ---by grace you have been saved---and raised us up
> with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ
> Jesus, so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable
> riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. ---
> Ephesians 2:1--7 ESV

You were **dead** in your sin. Can a dead person save themselves? Can a
person raise someone from the dead? Only God can do these things. Only
God can "make us alive together with Christ", "even when we were dead in
our trespasses." We have no ability to do this ourselves.

We were dead...But God saved us. The two most powerful words in the
Bible: **But God.**

\

It may also be part of God's plan that they are *not* saved. There are
plenty of people who had pivotal roles in God's plan who were not saved.
We love to hate on Judas (who, as the Bible hints to, was likely not
saved), but his actions were crucial to bringing God's plan to fruition.
If it weren't for Judas, Jesus may not have been arrested, and God's
plan wouldn't have been fulfilled.

In other words, **everything** that God does works towards our benefit
and for our good, including His choice of who to save, and when.

\

And that leads us to the next point: *who says that they won't be saved
at some point in the future?* God works in God's time, not ours. We may
be impatient and we may want to see them saved **now**, but that's not
how God works. All things work for our good in His time, not in ours.

\

**TL;DR:** Don't try to do God's job. It won't work and you'll just end
up frustrated. Know that it is up to God when, how, *and if*, they will
be saved.
