If the assessment is a *fine* for a violation of the Rules and
Regulations of the Association, or for some fault you've caused, you're
certainly welcome to request a payment plan, but it's not required.

If the assessment is a special assessment which has been assigned to
*all* homeowners for a new repair or a new addition, the HOA should
automatically be providing payment options through whoever does your
association's billing. Usually, it is the management company which does
the actual billing of the monthly dues and any special assessments. The
management company should be the ones who would be providing a monthly
payment option. If they don't, request it from them. If they can't do
it, then address the Board about it. If the Board refuses to create a
payment plan, you have two options: borrow the money at your own expense
and repay it according to the loan you took, or hire an attorney to
compel the Board to create a payment plan with their management company.

Ultimately, the Board wants their money. But at the same time, they
don't want to see you fall behind in payments, and it is clearly
unreasonable to expect homeowners to front a large assessment all up
front. If you can't afford the entire payment up front, it's in the
Board's best interest to work out a payment plan with you.
