**Content:** [Fascinating, you actually had different badges for
Reserves. Considering they were nothing more than honorary badges (kinda
like the Junior Deputy stickers I hand out), I can see why.\
\
Our uniforms are identical, to the device, to full-time uniforms, with
the exception of a \"Reserve\" rocker over the top of our shoulder
patch.\
\
Actually, a few years ago, the department asked the Reserves if they
wanted to remove it, since it is not a State requirement that it be
there. The Reserves at the time (before my time) decided that they would
keep it. As in my case, we are proud to be Reserves and happy to do the
job we have been privileged with being permitted to do.\
\
Which is why, I guess, we have never had an incident of a Reservist
abusing his authority, or attempting to act as a deputy outside of his
time of duty.\
\
I\'ve never provided my credentials off-duty unless I was asked to do
so. I was pulled over \*late\* one night, and I was armed, so I told the
officer that I was a Reserve Deputy and was armed. He asked for my
creds, confirmed my status, and sent me on my way. I didn\'t flaunt my
creds, but I did tell him who I was and why I was armed. Eh, it
conveniently works both ways, I guess. However (and I think I may have
mentioned this to you somewhere else), I still had to take a business
card and report the contact to my chain, and I copied him on it. This
policy prevents the \"professional courtesy\" from becoming an
unreported habit without the chain at least being made aware of who is
providing the courtesy.]{.rendered_qtext}
