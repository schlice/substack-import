The Eufy SoloCam S220 is unique because it requires no subscription fees
to run. It is completely self-contained, with its own onboard 8GB
storage. However, you can also connect it to an optional HomeBase 3
unit, which has expandable memory. Additionally, cloud storage is
*available* for a fee, but it is not **required**. The HomeBase gives
you some additional features, like AI face detection.

It is battery powered, and has a built-in solar panel. Only two hours of
direct sunlight a day is enough to keep the batteries essentially
charged forever.
