**Content:** [Neither is wonderful, and I can\'t speak to the Norway
case, but two things about Columbine:\
\
1. It was Columbine that forever changed the way we handle what we now
call \"active shooter\" scenarios. Up until that point, we handled them
like hostage scenarios, assuming the shooter actually wants to live and
actually doesn\'t want to kill hostages. Things are very much different
now. Active shooters want to kill as many people as they possibly can
before they get killed or take their own life. They don\'t expect to
walk away from the incident. It\'s a \"blaze of glory\" scenario now.\
\
2. Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold took their own lives; the police did
not shoot them.]{.rendered_qtext}
