If you're looking for *fairness*, you're looking in the wrong place.
It's a system of *justice*, not a system of *fairness*. It's not
designed to produce outcomes that are fair, but outcomes that are just.

And if you're unclear on what the difference between *justice* and
*fairness* is, then that may also be a problem.

The fact that rich people can travel more easily doesn't make the
Court's decision any less just. In fact, some companies are even paying
for their employees to travel to abortion-friendly states to get their
abortions if they choose.
