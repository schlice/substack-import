Nope. Nothing is un-hackable. No computer system cannot be hacked. And
no administrator worth his salt would ever claim that a system is
un-hackable. If users are able to use a system, it can be hacked.

There is a *spectrum* of hackability from the most secure system to the
least secure system. The most secure system has no users. The least
secure system has no access controls. So there is always a trade-off
between usability and security. In every computer system, from NORAD's
correlation systems all the way down to your humble PC, there is always
a trade-off between how usable the system is, and how secure the system
is. The more usable it is, the less secure it is. This is a universal
constant in computers.

While it is true that there is no NORAD system beyond hacking, if you
start adding conditions to your hacking situation, the probability of
NORAD systems being hacked decreases exponentially:

- Is there any NORAD system that cannot be hacked ***from the
  Internet?***
- Is there any NORAD system that cannot be hacked ***without physical
  access?***
- Is there any ***classified*** NORAD system that cannot be hacked
  ***without SIPRNET access?***

Once you start adding conditions to your scenario, the probability of a
NORAD system being hacked decreases exponentially.
