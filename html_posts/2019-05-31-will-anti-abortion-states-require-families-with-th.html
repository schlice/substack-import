**Will anti-abortion states require families with the financial
resources to care for a child to adopt children?**

No, just as pro-abortion states will not require families who do not
have the financial means to care for a child to have an abortion.

Not wanting to kill healthy babies out of convenience does not equate to
forcing people to adopt children.
