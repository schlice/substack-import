**Content:** [I think you\'re asking what will happen if it is found (as
Volkswagen alleges) that they are not the only car manufacturer who
specifically modified their cars so they would pass inspection, but only
at inspection time.\
\
If it is found that *all* of the world\'s cars have done this, then
there will need to be a serious discussion between lawmakers and auto
industry experts about *why*. The answer will be that the laws created
by lawmakers are simply not able to be achieved by auto makers. This may
just be because the mileage that the law specifies is simply not
attainable using traditional gas (petrol) powered engines.\
\
Lawmakers want to use the laws as a springboard to force auto makers to
embrace new technologies like electric and hydrogen fuel cells. However,
those technologies, while promising, are not enough to power the
world\'s transportation needs today, or even for the next 10 to 20
years. The simple fact is that engines powered by fossil fuels will
still be required for the foreseeable future, as electric does not
provide enough power to drive big loads normally pulled by trucks and
diesel-powered big engines, and fuel cells are not ready for prime
time.]{.rendered_qtext}
