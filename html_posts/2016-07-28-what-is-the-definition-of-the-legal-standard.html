**Negligence** is a failure to exercise reasonable care.

**Gross negligence** is a conscious and voluntary disregard for the need
to exercise reasonable care, and which usually results in grave harm to
people or property.

Both terms arise from a failure to exercise reasonable care, but simple
negligence can be due to unconscious (or accidental) failure to exercise
reasonable care, where gross negligence generally implies conscious (or
intentional) disregard for the need to exercise reasonable care. Gross
negligence is conscious indifference to, or the complete disregard for,
reasonably foreseeable consequences which would arise from the failure
to exercise reasonable care.

Note also that gross negligence is less severe than willful or wanton
misconduct, which is conscious or intentional disregard for laws or
rules with full knowledge that such disregard usually results in grave
harm to people or property. Findings of willful or wanton misconduct
have the ability to result in punitive damages, where gross misconduct
usually does not.
