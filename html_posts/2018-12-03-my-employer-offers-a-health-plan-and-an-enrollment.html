**My employer offers a health plan and an enrollment period. However
their custom made form did not include the option to add dependents (I
saved screenshots). Now the enrollment period is closed, what can I
do?**

Immediately speak to your HR department.

Adding/removing dependents is something that can be done year-round (you
don't only have babies during Open Enrollment).

You need to ensure that your dependents are covered, and if it's their
fault, they need to fix it and ensure your continuing coverage.
