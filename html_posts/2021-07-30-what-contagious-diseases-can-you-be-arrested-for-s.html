A majority of states have communicable disease laws that make it a crime
to expose another person to a contagious disease on purpose. The
specific contagious disease is irrelevant. Notice that the communicable
disease law says that you must spread the contagious disease **on
purpose**. This means that the state must prove that you knew that you
had the contagious disease, you knew you were contagious, and you
***intentionally*** acted in a way which could reasonably cause the
disease to spread.

There are also laws against assault and reckless behavior which can be
used to prosecute those who knowingly spread contagious diseases.

If there are emergency public health orders in place (like
"stay-at-home" orders), you can be arrested for violating those orders
as well.

What contagious diseases can you be arrested for spreading? Do you think
