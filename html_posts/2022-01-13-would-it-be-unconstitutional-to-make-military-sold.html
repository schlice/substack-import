Not unconstitutional, just not what the military is doing. Some expenses
may have to be repaid by some members, but not everyone.

The military is using "administrative separations" to remove members for
vaccine refusal. For those who don't qualify for exemptions and who
flat-out refuse the vaccine, they are being administratively separated,
and the character of their separation is "General (Under Honorable
Conditions)". This means that the member will not be allowed to
re-enlist or join another military branch, but they will still likely
retain access to all of their VA benefits, just as if they were
discharged with an Honorable characterization.

As far as pay goes, no service member separated based on vaccine refusal
will be eligible for involuntary separation pay.

Also, officers separated for vaccine refusal but who have not yet
completed their service obligation for attending a service academy or
being awarded a Reserve Officer Training Scholarship will be required to
repay their educational expenses. This policy includes service members
who have received advanced education funds.

So in some ways, depending on who you are and what the military has
already paid for, you may have to repay some of your expenses.
