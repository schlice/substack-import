Short answer: no.

Longer answer: It sounds like you are trying to find a middle ground
surrounding the use of deadly force. But there are a few things you need
to know:

The firearm is considered *deadly force*. I think that has been fairly
well established by now. Guns are designed to kill, and they do so very
efficiently.

Police are not permitted to use lethal force in a specifically
non-lethal way.

*Well, that just seems silly. Why can't they aim for the leg or
something?*

Several reasons:

1.  It's hard enough to hit what you're aiming at. Now add in the
    adrenaline in a high-stress situation, and it gets even harder. New
    York City police statistics show that simply hitting a target, let
    alone hitting it in a specific spot, is a difficult challenge. In
    2006, in cases where police officers intentionally fired a gun at a
    person, they discharged 364 bullets and hit their target 103 times,
    for a hit rate of 28.3 percent, according to the department's
    Firearms Discharge Report. The police shot and killed 13 people that
    year. In all shootings --- including those against people, animals
    and in suicides and other situations --- New York City officers
    achieved a 34 percent accuracy rate (182 out of 540), and a 43
    percent accuracy rate when the target ranged from zero to six feet
    away. 43% standing no more than six feet away. You really think
    someone can accurately hit a person in a foot at 50 yards? In
    reality, it would be a miracle if it did happen (note that more
    recent statistics are not available as NYPD has gone away from hit
    ratios in reporting).
2.  Police do not shoot to kill. They also do not shoot to "not kill."
    They shoot to stop the threat. The most effective way to stop the
    threat is to shoot in the "center of mass" of the individual.
    Shooting the periphery of mass may wound, but may not stop the
    threat. Our military fighters found this to be true with their M-16s
    firing 5.56 NATO rounds. The high-velocity darts would punch clean
    through an adversary (which is what they are designed to do --- take
    the person out of the fight). In modern warfare, the military found
    that not only is that type of wound survivable (good), but it didn't
    actually stop these fighters from fighting (not good). They had to
    change their bullets to something more substantial to actually stop
    the opponent (7.62 rounds, and change from the M-16 to the SCAR).
    You stop the act in the most effective way possible. You have a much
    greater chance of missing if you don't aim for center mass.
    Additionally, even if you shoot for a leg, you can hit something
    like the femoral artery and the suspect will bleed out before help
    can arrive, and he will be dead anyway.
3.  If you have the authority to use your firearm, it is because you
    need to stop someone who poses a threat to life or poses a threat of
    bodily harm to yourself or to others. The only time police are
    shooting a fleeing suspect is when he poses a danger to the lives of
    others. This would be a situation which *clearly* called for the use
    of lethal force. If lethal force is authorized, trying to use
    non-lethal force is counter-intuitive.
