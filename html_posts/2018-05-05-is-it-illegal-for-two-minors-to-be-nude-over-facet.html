**Is it illegal for two minors to be nude over FaceTime?**

As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."

The short answer is that yes, the act is illegal. However, while
illegal, whether or not the state will prosecute the two juveniles
varies greatly.

The question of whether or not two nude minors on FaceTime is legal
comes down to several legal definitions, but one of which is the
definition of "possession of child pornography," and nude images of
underage people is considered child pornography. Since you said that
both people are minors and you're on FaceTime, that means you're both
sending and receiving pictures at the same time, which means that
technically, you are both in possession of child pornography, and
distributing child pornography.

The question remains, "Will the state prosecute two consenting minors?"
From an optics perspective, most states simply will not prosecute two
minors as adults and won't charge them with any of those child
pornography statutes which would normally be charged if one of the
participants was an adult. In most states, both children would be
Youthful Offenders and would be disciplined under the juvenile justice
system. Punishments under the juvenile justice system include probation,
community service, youth court, youth incarceration and alternative
schooling.

Some states are not so lenient. Recent court cases in Utah have shown
that youth are charged as adults in sex cases, so it is not unheard of
that states will prosecute youth as adults, and will seek to prosecute
both participants in some cases.
