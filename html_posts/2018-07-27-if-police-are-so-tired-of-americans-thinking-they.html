**If police are so tired of Americans thinking they're racist,
uneducated, violent, formerly-bullied, lazy, power tripping losers with
guns, why aren't they trying to fix that image?**

1.  How would you propose police fix that image? We have 800,000 police
    officers in the United States. The ***vast majority*** of them are
    not any of the ridiculous things you quoted. So how would you
    propose that hundreds of thousands of people *who don't have any
    problem* try to fix a problem they don't have?
2.  What difference in the world does it make to police officers what
    *you* think of them? Does it make them do their jobs any
    differently? (hint: not at all)
3.  Why should changing their image in your eyes be their problem? If
    *you* have a problem with police officers, perhaps it's *you* who
    should be trying to change how you perceive them. It's not up to
    police to change how you see them.

Police aren't tired of Americans thinking anything at all about them,
because it says more about *Americans* than it does about *police*.
