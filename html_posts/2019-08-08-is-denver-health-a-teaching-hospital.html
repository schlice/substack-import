**Is Denver Health a teaching hospital?**

I am reasonably certain that [[Denver
Health](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f20755&url=https://www.denverhealth.org/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="denverhealth.org"}]{.qlink_container} is not a teaching
hospital.

If you're looking for a nearby teaching hospital, you should be looking
at
[[UCHealth](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e4e8d5&url=https://www.uchealth.org){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="uchealth.org"}]{.qlink_container}, which is attached to the
University of Colorado. They have locations throughout Colorado,
Nebraska, and Wyoming.
