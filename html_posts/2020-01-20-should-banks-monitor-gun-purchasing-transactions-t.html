**Should banks monitor gun purchasing transactions to try to prevent
mass shootings?**

Attempting to ascertain whether or not someone possesses a *mens rea* by
monitoring legal activity is an exercise in futility.

Not only is a gun hobby expensive, but there is nothing that says that a
collector is going to be a bad actor because they spent a lot of money
on guns.

But the proponents of this said, "But just look how much mass shooters
spent on guns!"

And I answer...duh. Guns are expensive.

But does *every* person who buys more than four guns become a mass
shooter?

Based on the number of people who own significant quantities of guns and
the number of mass shooters, clearly that answer is no.

Banks can no more prevent mass shootings by monitoring gun purchase
habits than they can prevent obesity by monitoring how often you make
purchases at McDonald's.
