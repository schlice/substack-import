answer is spot-on.\
\
Baltimore looked at Ferguson and said, \"We\'re going to do things
differently. We\'re not going to try to go in there like some kind of
\"police force\" to try and do, you know, \"policing.\" We\'re just
going to let them do their thing and then we\'ll use video to prosecute
them later.\" Yeah, we\'ll wait to see how effective *that* is.\
\
The rioters have calmed down (until the police officers are acquitted
and then Baltimore will be burning again), and in their wake, over 200
businesses have been ***destroyed. Completely gone. \"Total loss\"*** as
**** insurance companies call it. Was that the outcome the city was
going for?\
\
And you think that going after the rioters later is going to make up for
the fact that all of these businesses are now out of business? Some may
be able to recover with help from insurance, but many will have to
close. Congratulations, Baltimore, you have now created a slum in the
middle of downtown. And with all the insurance payouts, insurance
premiums for the remaining businesses are going to go up, which will
force other businesses to close as well. Who is going to want to do
business in Baltimore, knowing that the city won\'t stop the rioters?
Knowing that they have to pay more in insurance to do business there?\
\
All actions have consequences. And the inaction of Baltimore city
government, failing to stop the looters and rioters, or to even try,
will also have consequences.\
