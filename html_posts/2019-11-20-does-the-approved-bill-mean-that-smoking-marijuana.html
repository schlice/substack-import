**Does the approved bill mean that smoking marijuana is going to be
legal in the military?**

Regardless of what the bill says, the military can continue to ban
marijuana use if its use is inconsistent with the military mission.
Additionally, much more study will need to be done before long term
safety of its use can be quantified. For those reasons, it's unlikely
that the military would permit its use, even if the law were to allow
it. It would take quite some time before the military would allow
off-duty use of marijuana, if at all.

Remember too, the bill simply cleared the House Judiciary Committee. It
still has to be voted on by the full House (which would easily pass it),
and then voted on by the Senate if it has a chance of passing, which
right now seems unlikely. Finally, it would have to be signed by the
President, who is unlikely to do so even if both the House and Senate
pass it.

Hypothetically, if it did pass, the military would have a hard time with
it. But it's a hypothetical. The bill, as it stands, is a dead letter
when it hits the Senate. It has a snowball's chance in Hell of passing.
