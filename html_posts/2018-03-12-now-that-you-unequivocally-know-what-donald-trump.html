**Now that you unequivocally know what Donald Trump and the GOP are all
about, are you afraid that God will punish you if you vote for them
again?**

My friend Mr. Anonymous, God does not punish people for voting. He also
does not punish people for not voting. I missed in the Ten Commandments
where it said, "Thou shalt not vote for Donald Trump." Maybe you can
point out the Scripture to me so I can research it.

God *might* take issue with those who attempt to sow discontent among
people, so perhaps you should think more carefully before you try to
bait religious people into answering such questions.

And yes, apparently I just assumed Mr. Anonymous' gender. Too bad.
You're anonymous.
