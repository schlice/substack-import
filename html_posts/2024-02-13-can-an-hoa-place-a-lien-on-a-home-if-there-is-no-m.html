The lien isn't placed on the mortgage. The lien is placed on the
property, and uses the value of the real property to recover the money
they are owed.

When the property is sold, the proceeds are used to first pay off the
HOA, and then the remainder goes to the (now former) owner.

If this happens to you, you have already been in a very long fight with
the HOA who has fined you (or to whom you have failed to pay your dues
or other fees). Hopefully you have already retained an attorney to help
you in your fight, but if you haven't, now's a really good time to do
it.

You'll really only get out of it with an attorney, as the lien (and
imminent foreclosure) is being handled by the HOA's attorney. Perhaps
you can work out a payment plan to pay what you owe. Or perhaps you want
to sue, because the original fine or fee was improper, or violated the
Association's own rules. But either way, the only way to handle it is
with a lawyer.
