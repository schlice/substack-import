**Does Donald Trump have a medical degree or is he a quack doctor
presenting serious health risks to many Americans?**

Donald Trump does exactly what I do here on Quora. He provides GENERAL
MEDICAL INFORMATION. The information is timely, and needs to be widely
distributed so doctors can interpret it for their patients.

He does **not** provide **medical advice**, which requires a
doctor-patient relationship. He cannot prescribe medications, so unless
people are finding illegal ways to obtain medicine solely based on
general medical information, he's not introducing any serious risks to
Americans.

Or maybe you're talking about this:

[[Man Dies, Woman Hospitalized After Taking Form Of Chloroquine To

I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall in that house.

I'm not sure if this says more about the President, or more about the
people eating fishtank cleaner. I'll leave that calculus to you, dear
reader.

And in case it needs to be said, I'll include the standard medical
