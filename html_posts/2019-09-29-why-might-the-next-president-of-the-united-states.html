**Why might the next President of the United States push for a
constitutional amendment that says that the president can be indicted
while in office, even if that unsealed indictment is then scheduled for
hearings after the President leaves office?**

No President would do this, because it is unnecessary.

The Constitution provides that ***impeachment*** is the method for
dealing with Presidential lawlessness. Remember that impeachment is a
*political* remedy, while prosecution is a *legal* remedy, and
prosecution has a much higher bar to overcome than impeachment.

Besides, the power of prosecution is resident in a single unitary
President, under the Constitution. This wasn't done to allow for
Presidential lawlessness (see Impeachment). It was done to provide a
hedge against Congressional overreach and abuse of power. Congress was
routinely seen as the most powerful of the three branches, and it was
the vesting of prosecutorial authority in the President that was one of
the means to counter that power.
