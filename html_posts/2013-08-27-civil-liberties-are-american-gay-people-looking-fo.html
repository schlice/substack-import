<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [As a matter of technicality, they are asking for new<br>rights.\<br>\<br>Previously, discrimination laws were based on physical, immutable<br>characteristics, with the exception of religion which is already<br>protected under the Constitution. For example, discrimination can be<br>based on race, color, creed, sex, or national origin. These things are<br>physical and immutable (sex change operations aside). Religious<br>discrimination is covered under the first amendment.\<br>\<br>Gays are asking for a new right. They want to add sexual orientation to<br>the list of items that can be held as discriminatory if used as a means<br>to discriminate. We are moving into uncharted territory; we are now<br>going to use people\'s thoughts and feelings as something which can be<br>discriminatory if violated.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
