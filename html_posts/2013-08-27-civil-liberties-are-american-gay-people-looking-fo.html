**Content:** [As a matter of technicality, they are asking for new
rights.\
\
Previously, discrimination laws were based on physical, immutable
characteristics, with the exception of religion which is already
protected under the Constitution. For example, discrimination can be
based on race, color, creed, sex, or national origin. These things are
physical and immutable (sex change operations aside). Religious
discrimination is covered under the first amendment.\
\
Gays are asking for a new right. They want to add sexual orientation to
the list of items that can be held as discriminatory if used as a means
to discriminate. We are moving into uncharted territory; we are now
going to use people\'s thoughts and feelings as something which can be
discriminatory if violated.]{.rendered_qtext}
