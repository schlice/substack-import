As always, your specifics are going to be outlined in your Governing
Documents. Removal from the Board is dependent on the rules set up in
your particular HOA, and this is normally going to be found in your
Bylaws.

In my past HOA, any conviction for any fiduciary crimes was instant
removal from the Board. Also, if your account was not current (you
weren't paying your dues), you could be removed from the Board.

Finally, there are some state-level laws which can lead to HOA Board
members being removed. For example, in Florida, the homeowners can vote
independently to remove a Board member for any reason whatsoever, at any
time. If that form is delivered to the Board, the Board member in
question is automatically removed from the Board; no vote or meeting
necessary. The Board can appoint a replacement to complete the removed
member's term.

War story alert: In my last neighborhood, a Board member resigned in
lieu of being thrown off the Board by homeowners. She was about to be
removed because of her racist, bigoted, xenophobic, expletive-laden
tirade that she went on in a gathering outside of my home, in which she
intelligently screamed to my Puerto Rican neighbor, "Go back to your
f\*\*\*n country!" to which he replied, "I'M AMERICAN!!!" And that was
the *tame* interaction. Anyway, the next day, the petition to remove her
from the Board began to circulate and would have *easily* gathered the
required number of signatures, but she submitted her resignation in lieu
of being forcibly removed from the Board by the homeowners.
