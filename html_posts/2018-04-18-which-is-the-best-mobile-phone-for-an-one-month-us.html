**Which is the best mobile phone for an one-month use for a salesman and
sell it afterwards? (I need high quality camera and high battery
capacity)**

*(In case you're wondering, any time you ask a "which is the best"
question, it's all opinion. I'm trying to base my answer on independent
reviews from around the Internet, but in the end, it's still just
opinion. Your mileage may vary)*

In the United States mobile market, you're not really going to find an
amazing phone with a fantastic camera **and** amazing battery life.
You're either going to get incredible battery capacity and a mediocre
camera, or one of the best cameras on the market and so-so battery.

I would suggest going for the latter. And if that's the case, you want
the **Pixel 2** from Google.

While it does not possess the best *physical* camera hardware available
in a mobile phone today (right now, that goes to either the iPhone X or
the Galaxy S9+), the software which runs the Pixel's camera produces the
best quality photos, every time, in every environment, **hands down**.
You simply cannot take a bad photo with that phone. There's one of two
reasons you buy a Pixel 2: you're a hardcore Android fanboy, or you want
the best camera experience in town. There's no two ways about it. If you
want the camera which will take the best pictures every time, you get a
Pixel 2.

Plus, since carriers don't directly sell them, you can get it from
Google and the resale market is really solid.

On the downside, battery life is so-so. But you can get external
batteries and battery cases of all kinds. You can't really get good
external cameras. So the trade off is not that bad in my book.
