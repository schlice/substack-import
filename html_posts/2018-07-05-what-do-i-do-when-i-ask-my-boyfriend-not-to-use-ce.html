**What do I do when I ask my boyfriend not to use certain belongings for
a particular reason, and he blatantly defies my request right in front
of me and still does what I asked him not to do?**

Clearly, this is a power struggle. You'd like him to do something, and
he's blatantly, right in front of you, defying your request.

Perhaps he's not understanding just how important it is that he do what
you ask. You might consider sitting down with him and discussing why you
want what you want, why it is important to you, and how it makes you
feel when he blatantly ignores what you're asking. I'd bet that it
probably makes you feel like your requests hold no meaning for him. Does
he really value your relationship that little?

If the behavior continues, maybe this isn't the guy you thought he was,
and maybe it's time to re-think your relationship and where it might be
going.
