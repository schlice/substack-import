**Should school officials become certified law enforcement officers,
just to protect their students? Is this a valid work-around?**

School officials, as in the Time article, will always have the right to
become auxiliary law enforcement officers or Reserve Deputies if they
choose, which will then allow them to conceal a firearm on school
grounds. The problem here is that usually, when this happens, they have
additional auxiliary officer or Reserve Deputy duties they now have to
perform. In my county, Reserve Deputies are required to give a minimum
of 192 hours annually in volunteer time back to the county (granted,
that averages out to only 16 hours a month), and that may be time that
an educator did not want to give just for the privilege of carrying a
firearm in school.

Additionally, this educator believes the full law enforcement training
was necessary, but others do not. More importantly, I really don't think
that putting teachers through law enforcement training is a viable
option for all educators, since it really requires a wholly different
mindset than the vast majority of educators possess.

A better option in my opinion would be [[firearms training specifically
designed for
educators](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=043d97&url=http://cocivilliberties.org/faster/){.external_link

concealed firearms. The program I linked above is called FASTER. FASTER
stands for Faculty/Administrator Safety Training and Emergency Response.
It is training specifically designed for educators who have the desire
to conceal a firearm to protect their students. Please take a few
minutes and check it out.

Here in Colorado, when certified programs like FASTER exist, school
districts can authorize graduates who also possess a Concealed Carry
permit from the Sheriff to conceal firearms on school property.

So to answer your question:

**Should school officials become certified law enforcement officers,
just to protect their students? Is this a valid work-around?** I think
it will always remain an option for an instructor to go this route **if
they choose** and **if they understand all of the ramifications of that
decision**. In fact, it's unlikely that a school district could
*prevent* an instructor from doing this if they choose.

*However, I don't believe it is necessary.* I believe that training
options like FASTER are much better since we tailor the training
specifically to educators, and they then won't have the requisite
additional duty which must be performed as a Reserve Deputy or an
auxiliary police officer.
