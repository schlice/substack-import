**If I tell someone to commit an illegal act but they do not do it, am I
guilty of anything?**

In general, no.

Conspiracy to commit a crime requires more than one person to agree to
commit a crime together. It then requires one of the people involved to
take "a substantial step" towards the execution of that crime.

One person telling another person to commit a crime does not amount to
conspiracy, especially since no one took any substantial steps towards
actually committing the crime.
