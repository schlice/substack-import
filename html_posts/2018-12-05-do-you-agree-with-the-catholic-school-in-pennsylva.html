**Do you agree with the Catholic School in Pennsylvania that just fired
a teacher who is unmarried and became pregnant? Is this justified
legally and morally?**

As a religious institution, the school is authorized to hold its staff
to a religious standard. Catholics do not condone sex outside of
marriage. Therefore, the school is both legally and morally correct in
terminating the teacher.
