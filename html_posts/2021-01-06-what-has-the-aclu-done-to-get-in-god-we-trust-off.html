**What has the ACLU done to get In God We Trust off our government
buildings and currency and stop official prayers from being asked in
those same buildings?**

They have done as much as they can do, but they are fighting an uphill
battle.

Groups trying to remove the phrase from our currency have filed many
suits through the ACLU, and the firm has written many *amicus briefs*
supporting the removal of the phrase.

However, they have not been able to overcome the doctrine of
*accommodationism,* which is a doctrine which basically states that
governments can endorse religious groups so long as they do so equally.

Also, "In God We Trust" is our *national motto* and has been so since
1956. It's been in our national anthem as our "motto" since the poem was
penned in 1814 (although it wasn't actually adopted as our national
anthem until later). It's not much of an argument to say that you want
the national motto removed from the national currency because reasons.

I'm going to quote a section from Wikipedia just to show you how popular
the phrase is in the United States, and how trying to get it removed is
a literal fool's errand:
