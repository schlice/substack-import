"Double jeopardy" "cases" are a misnomer, since a case would not
actually be brought if double jeopardy attaches.

There was a case that established case law surrounding how double
jeopardy would attach if there were multiple crimes being charged. In
[[Blockburger v. United
States](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d3848a&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockburger_v._United_States){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}, the Supreme Court
established that if separate charges are supported by separate facts,
even if they are rolled into a single case, the defendant can be retried
for individual charges not separately charged previously. Justice James
Sutherland wrote the opinion for a unanimous court:

> *Each of the offenses created requires proof of a different element.
> The applicable rule is that, where the same act or transaction
> constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test
> to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one
> is whether each provision requires proof of an additional fact which
> the other does not.*[\[1\]](#XFuBp){#cite-XFuBp .citation_link}
