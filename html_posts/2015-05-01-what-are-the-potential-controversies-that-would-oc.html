**Content:** [If we get into a scenario where we can genetically modify
humans and make them \"perfect,\" then only perfect people would be
allowed to live. Imperfections would be eradicated from the gene pool.
Anyone found with a genetic imperfection would be terminated. Life would
not be valued for humanity, it would be valued for perfection.\
\
If you can\'t imagine what this would look like, read \"Brave New
World\" by Aldous Huxley. I first read this book in high school, and it
so touched me that I\'ve re-read it at least annually. This book is a
classic, and it discusses exactly what you have asked. So if you really
want to know what could happen if we allow genetic modification of
humans, read that book.]{.rendered_qtext}
