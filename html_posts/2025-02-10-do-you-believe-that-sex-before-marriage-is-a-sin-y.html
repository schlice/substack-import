So since you cited "sin" in your question, this question only applies to
religious believers. You can safely ignore all the answers from
atheists, since if you don't believe in a higher power, there really is
no universal right and wrong anyway, and no behavior is *verboten*. Sin
can only be properly understood in the religious context, so your
question only really applies to religious believers.

Now, in the Christian religion, the Bible (Hebrews 13:4) is clear that
sex needs to be maintained within the confines of marriage:

> *Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be
> undefiled, for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous.*

Clearly therefore, what is **acceptable** *within the context of
marriage* is **unacceptable** *outside of the context of marriage*.

Additionally, God lays out the purpose of sex, and it is in the context
of marriage. For Christians, God designed sex to be something shared
between a husband and a wife. For the Christian married couple, sex is
about more than just sharing your bodies. It's a journey of intimacy.
Since anything within the boundaries of marriage is acceptable, God
leaves it up to the married couple to work through what things are
acceptable *for them*. For example, some couples include oral sex or sex
toys in their repertoire. For others, it may be a trigger for memories
of past abuse or old pornography habits. So the same act can be loving
for some couples and harmful for others.

Working through those boundaries together is a great way for a couple to
grow in love more deeply as a couple while seeking God's wisdom in
everything.
