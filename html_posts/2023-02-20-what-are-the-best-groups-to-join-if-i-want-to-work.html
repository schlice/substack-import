Despite what all of my compatriots have suggested, there are good groups
to join if you want to work on banning guns in the US.

- [[Everytown for Gun
  Safety](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b142f6&url=https://www.everytown.org/){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
  qt-tooltip="everytown.org"}]{.qlink_container}
- [[Moms Demand
  Action](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7a3faf&url=https://momsdemandaction.org/){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
  qt-tooltip="momsdemandaction.org"}]{.qlink_container}
- [[Brady
  Campaign](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0c17ad&url=https://www.bradyunited.org/){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
  qt-tooltip="bradyunited.org"}]{.qlink_container}

If you believe strongly in this issue, by all means, join these groups
and work hard to eliminate guns in the US. My colleagues here have done
an admirable job explaining ***why these group's efforts will never
achieve what you're looking for***, but hey, it's not up to me to fail
to answer your question just because you're never going to achieve what
you're trying to do. Still, if you want to join a group to work on
banning guns in the US, these are the groups for you.

Good luck!
