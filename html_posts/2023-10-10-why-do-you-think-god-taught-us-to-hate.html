While He didn't "teach" us to hate, He created us with the capacity to
both love and hate.

This shouldn't be surprising. We naturally hate the things which destroy
what we love.

And if we are made in the image of God, then God too can hate. But the
difference is that God's hate is *perfect*, while our hate can easily
lead us to sin, as we cannot hate without ill will.

We cannot love with a perfect love, nor can we hate with a perfect
hatred. But God can both love and hate perfectly, because He is God. God
can hate without sinful intent. He can hate the sinner in a perfectly
holy way and still lovingly forgive the sinner at the moment of
repentance and faith (Malachi 1:3; Revelation 2:6; 2 Peter 3:9).

It might seem a contradiction that a God who is love can also hate. Yet
that's exactly what the Bible says is true: God is love (1 John 4:8),
and God hates (Hosea 9:15). God's nature is love (He always does what is
best for others) and He hates that which is contrary to His nature (He
hates that which is contrary to love).
