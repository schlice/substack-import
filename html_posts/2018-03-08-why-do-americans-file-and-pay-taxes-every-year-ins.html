**Why do Americans pay taxes every year instead of every 5 or 10
years?**

Americans pay the majority of their taxes out of their paychecks in a
process called "withholding." Their employers conveniently deduct their
taxes directly out of their pay, since Americans pay income tax, and
employers provide income. It's convenient for employers to remit the
income tax for their employees, and the IRS can monitor employers
instead of every single American every two weeks. Employers use an
estimation called "exemptions" to determine an estimate of how much tax
to withdraw from your paycheck.

Once a year, Americans rectify those numbers, using actual calculations
that employers simply could not have access to. If the taxpayer overpaid
throughout the course of the year (through their payroll deductions,
which is usually the case), they get a refund on the amount they
overpaid. If they didn't pay enough (because they perhaps got some
untaxed income from another place, or they didn't withhold enough from
their paycheck), then they pay the difference. The IRS can then monitor
this process once a year to ensure legal compliance. It's much more
convenient and less expensive for the IRS to monitor all taxpayers
annually.

So once a year, American taxpayers rectify the amount that they should
have paid with the amount they already paid. They don't actually "pay
taxes" only once a year.
