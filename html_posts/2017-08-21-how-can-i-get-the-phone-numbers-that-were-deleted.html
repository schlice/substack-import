If you are the account holder, your mobile phone carrier has the log of
received/sent calls. If you have online account access, chances are you
can simply log in to your carrier's portal and find the call log. But
even if they don't display it on the screen, a quick call or chat with
Customer Service can usually net you the call logs you're looking for
sent to your email.
