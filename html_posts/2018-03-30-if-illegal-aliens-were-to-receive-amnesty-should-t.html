**If illegal aliens were to receive amnesty, should they still be denied
the right to vote?**

It depends on what "amnesty" looks like.

In my opinion, illegals should be granted permanent resident alien
status (i.e. they should be given green cards). Make them prove that
they've been here for X amount of time, they've been good citizens
(haven't gotten in trouble), they've paid their taxes, and they can stay
as permanent resident aliens.

Permanent resident aliens are **not** US citizens, and therefore cannot
vote.

They can stay. They can have jobs. They can pay taxes. They can drive
cars. They can raise families.

But they can't vote until they become citizens.
