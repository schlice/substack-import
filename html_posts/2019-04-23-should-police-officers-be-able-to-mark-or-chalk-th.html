**Should police officers be able to mark or chalk the wheels of parked
cars in the interest of parking enforcement? Or is this a 4th Amendment
violation?**

This is an absolutely fascinating case.

A Michigan woman, who admittedly was a "frequent recipient of parking
tickets" eventually decided to challenge the constitutionality of
chalking tires.

And she won.

[[The 6th Circuit Court
ruled](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=591248&url=http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/chalking-tires-constitutes-unreasonable-search-appeals-court-rules){.external_link

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="abajournal.com"}]{.qlink_container} that when the police
mark a tire with a piece of chalk, this is a "trespass" on a
Constitutionally-protected location in a public place. In just the same
way that when SCOTUS ruled in 2012 that placing a GPS tracker on a
vehicle is a "search," the 6th Circuit ruled that placing a chalk mark
on a vehicle is an unconstitutional trespass to gain evidence, and is a
4th Amendment violation.

Additionally, the court found that chalking vehicles violates the
"reasonableness" standard. The city searches vehicles \"that are parked
legally, without probable cause, or even so much as \'individualized
suspicion of wrongdoing\' --- the touchstone of the reasonableness
standard,\"

Clearly, police can sidestep the whole Constitutional issue by simply
taking a picture of the vehicle, which is perfectly legal. You can chalk
mark the ground around the tires, since that's not actually trespassing
on the vehicle, but is marking the public area around the vehicle. The
marks on the ground, in combination with the photographs, should be
enough evidence to determine if the vehicle is in the same position, or
if it was moved and returned to the same spot.

Now, if even photographs are found to be in violation of the
"reasonableness" standard, because the city takes pictures of vehicles
without any probable cause that the vehicle is illegally parked, then
this may change how cities enforce parking regulations. This may force
more cities to move to metered parking rather than time-based
enforcement. Personally, I believe that since it is perfectly legal to
take a picture of a vehicle for whatever purpose you like, there should
be no Constitutional issue taking pictures of city streets and then
comparing them to future pictures of city streets for vehicles in the
same location for more than the allotted time. The city could even set
up cameras which routinely take pictures of sections of the street.
Parking officials could review the camera snapshots for vehicles parked
in one spot for more than the allotted time, and ticket those vehicles.
The photographic evidence should be sufficient to meet the
reasonableness standard, and since the cameras take continuous pictures
of all parking spots, there is no issue of probable cause in targeting
any specific vehicle.

So she should be proud that she caused police procedure to change,
possibly causing city parking policies to be re-examined, and she made a
4th Amendment case which law students will be talking about for decades.
And she got out of one parking ticket.

But that's about it.

She's still going to get parking tickets.
