In general, yes. If the prohibition is listed somewhere in the Governing
Documents (which includes any Rules and Regulations the HOA is
authorized to create) then they can indeed prohibit commercial vehicles
from parking in a resident's driveway.

My last HOA did have this restriction, but my current HOA does not.

But even in my last HOA, we made an exception for emergency vehicles
(i.e. vehicles that you are required to have so you can respond from
your home to emergencies). One guy brought his truck from the gas
company (and it indicated it was an emergency response vehicle) and
several police officers and sheriff's deputies had their marked cruisers
at home, and those were all exceptions.
