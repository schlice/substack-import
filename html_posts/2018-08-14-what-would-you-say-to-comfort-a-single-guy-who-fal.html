**What would you say to comfort a single guy who falls in love with a
prostitute who is married and has two children?**

"Sir, you're a moron."

1.  You don't fall in love with a prostitute.
2.  You don't fall in love with a *married* prostitute, because the
    family dynamics in that situation are just wrong on so many levels.
3.  You don't fall in love with a married prostitute *who has two
    children*. I'll bet she's not 100% sure that they're the husband's.

Literally, forget about her and move on. And quit frequenting
prostitutes and expecting long-term unpaid relationships.
