**Why did Colorado Springs Police ignore my repeated reports of a
squatter using my address for Medicaid?**

First of all, you're talking about two separate things: squatter's
rights, and Medicaid fraud.

As to squatters, it's not something that the police handle, because it's
not a criminal matter, but a civil matter. When the police arrive, the
squatter says he was invited to stay by the lawful owner or a previous
tenant, and under Colorado law, that means that the squatter gets to
stay until that statement can be disproved in court.

Once the owner has convinced a judge that the squatter is not a legal
resident, then the Sheriff can post an eviction notice, and even then,
the squatter has anywhere from 14 to 21 days before he is successfully
removed from the home.

As to Medicaid fraud, it's up to the U.S. Health Department's Office of
Medicaid Management to address the fraudulent activity. Please call them
at 1 (877) 87 FRAUD. You can choose to make your complaint anonymous,
and your complaint will always remain confidential.
