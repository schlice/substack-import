**Did God create dinosaurs?**

1.  Everything which had a beginning had a cause.
2.  Dinosaurs had a beginning.
3.  Therefore, dinosaurs had a cause.

Since we know that the universe had a beginning, the universe also had a
cause. So there must have been a creator who was not caused (i.e.
self-existent or eternal) who created everything, including dinosaurs.

Archaeology tells us that dinosaurs existed on the earth between 245 and
66 million years ago, which is many millions of years before the first
humans existed.
