Cramp their hands.

Closing day means signing all of the required forms to close the sale.
You visit the office of the title company, where stacks of papers await
your signature. They have to describe each form, what it means, where
you need to initial, and where you need to sign. You spend a long time
doing this.

Unless you have agreed to some form of delayed possession (rent-back or
other delayed possession), once you are done, the buyer takes possession
of the house immediately, and you get the key and a lovely gift basket
from your agent. You can go to the house immediately and start moving
in. The seller has already vacated the house by closing day.
