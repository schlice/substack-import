At best, she was simply incorrect about scale. At worst, she was
outright lying. She said the following:

> We have hospitals that are almost at full capacity with people
> severely ill on ventilators. We have over 100,000 children, which
> we've never had before, in serious condition, many on ventilators.

First, the numbers are wrong. At best, we've had around 89.000 children
hospitalized ***with COVID*** since August. Not currently. Also, that
doesn't mean "hospitalized with COVID-19 disease," it means
"hospitalized. And oh by the way, we tested them and they happen to be
COVID-19 positive, whether or not they have symptoms."

The "in serious condition, many on ventilators" is just 100% false.
There is no truth to that at all, and it makes it seem like we have a
hundred thousand kids in PICU units all on ventilators dying from COVID,
and that is absolutely incorrect. We are indeed experiencing a bump in
cases with Omicron, but it is demonstrably weaker than previous
variants, and in most cases is treatable at home with therapeutics. It's
certainly not hospitalizing people in record numbers, and it most
definitely is not affecting children at the scale she claims.

Sotomayor, and Justice Breyer (who claimed that we have "750 million new
cases" of coronavirus in the country," even though we only have 330
million people in the country) are caught in the classic liberal trap.
They want to believe that things are really that bad, and they want to
do everything they can to "wake people up" to just how bad things are.
So they resort to "exaggeration" or even "willful mischaracterization of
the facts" in order to make their point. They either don't know, and
don't care to know, the actual numbers, and so they just "make up facts"
based on snippets of things they heard, or they actually do know the
facts and are willfully distorting them to increase their perceived
impact at their target audience --- people who hear what Supreme Court
Justices say like the old "E.F. Hutton" commercials, people who hang on
every word they say as if they are demigods or something.

They are of the opinion that whatever they think should be true, is
actually true, and if they say it, it is true, or it will become true
after they say it. Because it becomes true if enough people believe it
is true.

Who would have thought that such illogical thought was possible in our
Supreme Court? The level of know-nothingism which has infected even
Supreme Court justices is staggering. You would have thought that
someone who should have known that they were going to be ruling on COVID
cases would have read up on both sides of the issue. They should have at
least read the CDC stuff and then read the Great Barrington Declaration
in order to understand both sides of the issue. Alas, it seems like
those days are over, and we don't even have objective Supreme Court
justices any longer.

So maybe Trump was right to pack the courts (at all levels) with as many
Constitutional textualists as he possibly could. Huh.

hospitalized for COVID in the USA? Where are they getting their
information from?
