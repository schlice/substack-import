You must be careful in this situation. Having a handgun in your hand
**might** qualify as brandishing because it can be "brought to bear"
very quickly, and your hand is in a position that you can activate the
weapon without relocating your hand. It depends on your jurisdiction and
your local prosecutors. Just answering the door holding a gun may be
illegal where you live. Additionally, in some jurisdictions, a lot of
brandishing charges rest on the opinion of the victim. Did they feel
threatened? Did they feel like you were using force against them, even
if you never raised the gun from your side? Holding a gun while
answering the door is a slippery slope, open to lots of interpretation,
and not a place you want to get to.

Like I said in my own answer, leave the gun in the holster with your
hand on the backstrap (this is not brandishing, this would instead be
considered a "ready position"). You can make an incredibly strong case
against brandishing if the gun remains in the holster, even if your hand
is on the backstrap; holstered weapons are generally considered "safe
carry" weapons.

If it's a rifle, leave it slung across your shoulder. Or, as some of the
other respondents mentioned, just don't answer the door. You have no
legal obligation to answer the door, ever. If it's the police, you still
don't have to answer the door. If they have a search warrant, you might
want to answer the door if you're not keen on buying a new door, but
other than that, you are under no legal obligation, ever, to open your
door if you were not expecting someone to be there.
