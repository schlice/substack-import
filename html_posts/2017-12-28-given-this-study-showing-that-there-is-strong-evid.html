**Given this study showing that there is no evidence the US government
represents its people, what arguments are there for its legitimacy?**

Whether or not a government is representative of its people, or even
performs "the will of the people" as it was elected to do, has nothing
to do with the **legitimacy** of that elected government.

Legitimacy of a US government is solely determined by the legality of
the election. If the election was legal, and the election results were
certified, the government is legitimate. Period. There is no guarantee
of results when electing US government officials.

The way to handle governments which "do not represent their people" is
to elect a new government that does during the next election cycle, and
to be smarter voters next time.

Representation and legitimacy are two totally separate things in the
United States.
