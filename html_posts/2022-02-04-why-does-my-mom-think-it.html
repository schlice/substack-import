Let me ask you this question:

If you carry your baby to term and give it up for adoption, ***what
difference does it make?***

If you have been mentally scarred by your experience, and you simply
don't want to go through that again, and if it's truly "your body, your
choice," then if you choose to carry the baby to term, what's the harm
in that?

In other words, if you feel it is going to be better for your mental
health to carry the baby to term and then give it up for adoption, then
why do you care what your mother thinks about abortion vs adoption?

It doesn't matter whether or not abortion *actually* can cause mental
damage; there will be plenty of opinions on either side of the aisle.
None of them are relevant. What matters is what *you* think.

I truly believe it is your body, and you do get to choose. I would
*prefer* that you carry the baby to term and give it up for adoption
rather than killing it, but that's my preference, it has no bearing on
you or your life.

**TL;DR: Don't worry about what your mom thinks. It's your body, and
your life. Do what will be best for you.**

Original question:

Why does my mom think it's so much easier to have an abortion than carry
to full term? I have had 2 abortions and 1 miscarriage, I am damaged
mentally and don't want to go through it again with this pregnancy.
