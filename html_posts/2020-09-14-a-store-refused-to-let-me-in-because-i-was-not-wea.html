**A store refused to let me in because I was not wearing a mask. How can
I sue them?**

You can sue anyone for anything in America. But you're going to have a
really hard time winning, especially in this case.

First, you have to show that you are legally permitted to bypass the law
in your area, which probably says that you have to wear a mask into a
store. This means that you must be claiming to be a member of a
protected class that cannot wear a mask. I presume, therefore, that you
were wearing a face shield. No? Then you were probably in violation of
the law yourself, and you'll have a really hard time making your case
that the store wouldn't allow you to violate the law.

But let's presume you live somewhere where there is not a local
requirement to wear a mask. There are a few states in the US where masks
are simply encouraged, not required. In those cases, can a business
refuse to let you in if you are not wearing a mask?

The answer is **yes**, a business (on private property) can require you
wear a mask, and can refuse to let you in if you are not. Business
transactions are *mutual*: you have the right to determine what stores
you will frequent, and the store has the right to either do business
with you or not. As long as the business is enforcing the rule in a
non-discriminating way (i.e. they make everyone wear masks, no
exceptions), the business is allowed to enact a mask policy, and they
are allowed to refuse to let you in if you choose to not wear one.

Before the pandemic, stores (especially food stores and local
restaurants in our beach towns, especially right along the beach) would
routinely have signs posted which read, "No shirt, no shoes, no
service." This means you had to be wearing a shirt and shoes before you
could enter. Would you similarly sue those stores for not allowing you
to enter shirtless and barefoot? The store is usually doing these things
for health and safety reasons...just as they are for the mask policy.
