**Is there a way that the president could effectively make marijuana
legal with an executive order or similar?**

The answer to the question is absolutely yes.

Marijuana is illegal at the Federal level because of a law called the
Controlled Substances Act. Congress passed this law, but it is the Drug
Enforcement Agency (DEA), which works for the Executive Branch, that
oversees the Drug Schedules. These are the lists of drugs which are
illegal under Federal law (which, as some other answerers have pointed
out, is a gross Federal overreach, but that is the answer to another
question). The DEA is an Executive-branch agency. Their boss is the
President.

Since the DEA controls which drugs are on which schedule, and the DEA
works for the President, the President can issue an Executive Order
directing the DEA to move marijuana to whatever schedule he tells them
to. For example, he could have it moved to Schedule IV, so it would
share a danger level with drugs like Xanax, Kionopin, Halcion, and
Valium. Or he could, at least, move it to Schedule II, where it would
still be considered highly addictive (which is debatable), with a high
potential for abuse, but has accepted medical uses. Drugs like cocaine
and opium live on Schedule II.

He could also use an Executive Order to order the DOJ to use as much
"prosecutorial discretion" as they wanted, in order to minimize
prosecution of marijuana crimes, effectively telling them not to
prosecute those cases. Which is exactly what President Obama did during
his administration. This signaled to willing states that if they chose
to change their own laws, the Federal government wouldn't get in the
way. Enter Colorado, who decided to make the first fully
government-approved marketplace for marijuana. They are still living
through the unintended consequences of that decision, but that too is an
answer to another question. Many other states either decriminalized
possession of small quantities of marijuana, or allowed medical use
only.
