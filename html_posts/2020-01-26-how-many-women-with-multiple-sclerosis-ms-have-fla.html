**How many women with multiple sclerosis (MS) have flare-ups after
giving birth?**

Most of them.

We know that MS has a hormonal component. This is likely why two to
three times more women develop MS than men.

We also know that pregnancy hormones help to suppress MS symptoms. This
is either thought to be because of the immunoprotective effects of
pregnancy on the mother's body, or because some of the pregnancy
hormones (prolactin comes to mind) can actually cause myelin to be
rebuilt.

Whatever the case, most women with MS find that their symptoms subside
during pregnancy, and then within a few months of delivery will return,
usually with a relapse. This is not harmful to mom or baby, it's just
something a woman with MS needs to consider before getting pregnant.
