**How can I get my HOA to allow short term rentals on a platform like
AirBnB, VRBO, etc. when our bylaws state that \"All rentals must be for
an initial term of no less than one (1) year\"?**

You have to get your bylaws changed. Each community sets rules on what's
required for changing bylaws, but it's usually a percentage of
homeowners.

If you can show the Board that you have the requisite votes to change
the bylaws, they should put it to a vote in the community.

You should circulate a petition within your community to see if you can
garner the requisite support to change your bylaws.
