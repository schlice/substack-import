For right now, he hasn't banned anything. He made a Twitter post
indicating that a policy would be "forthcoming" which banned transgender
personnel. We don't know how that policy will handle presently-serving
transgender personnel. Unfortunately, we will have to wait and see what
the policy says when it comes out.

Therefore, we cannot comment on how the policy will affect unit
readiness, mission accomplishment, operations, or national security. The
policy will likely have minimal effect on any of these.

It will have an impact on unit cohesiveness, morale, and budget, budget
being the biggest among all the impacts it will have. By banning
transgender personnel from the military, the military will not be forced
to pay the estimated \$3.7 billion over 10 years if military members
choose to undergo gender reassignment surgery. They will need to get the
surgery (i.e. they won't be able to remain transgender and remain in
their physical gender) because they cannot have their gender marker (the
gender indicated on their ID card and personnel records) changed without
it, and they cannot wear the uniform of their gender identity until such
time as their gender marker is changed. Therefore, the only way to get
their gender marker changed is to get gender reassignment surgery.
Without surgery, they will not be able to align their gender expression
with their gender identity because they can only wear the uniform of the
sex indicated by their gender marker.
