**Would you be able to give up your smartphone in exchange for 2018 Dell
Inspiron laptop?**

No. And I *work* for Dell.

Why not? **Because they accomplish different things.**

I need to have my phone on me when I leave the house to, you know,
receive phone calls. I actually do that on occasion. I *can* do that on
the laptop, but it's a shade bulkier than a phone.

My laptop is valuable for work. I can edit spreadsheets and docs and
presentations and share files and chat with co-workers and screen share
with customers and log into customer systems to fix them. I *can* do
that on a phone but it's uncomfortable.
