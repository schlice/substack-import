It's unlikely. Because while the First Amendment allows you the freedom
to speak, the government still has a compelling interest in maintaining
public safety. Therefore, it has long been recognized that the
government can restrict the **time, place,** and **manner** of speech.

For example, I could parade around naked downtown and I could claim that
my exhibition is an artistic display and is thus protected by the First
Amendment, right? Well, not so fast. Since the state has the compelling
interest in *public decency* (for now), they can limit such a display to
areas where people must *actively consent* to see such things. The state
also has the interest in protecting children from such displays.
Therefore, the state can restrict my display.

Similarly, the new Public Nuisance law made it illegal in Florida to
display or project images onto a building, structure or property without
permission. Limiting public nuisances is part of the state's compelling
interest in creating a well-ordered environment for public safety.
Therefore, not being able to post messages on buildings or structures or
property without permission is in line with the state's compelling
interest and limits free speech in the least restrictive way possible.
