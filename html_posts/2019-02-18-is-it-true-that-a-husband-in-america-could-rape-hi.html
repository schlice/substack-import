**Is it true that a husband in America could rape his wife without
penalty from the law?**

Absolutely not. [[Marital
rape](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=80de82&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marital_rape_(United_States_law)){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} (also known as spousal
rape) is illegal in all 50 states.

It does have a very long history, and for many parts of that history, it
was *not* illegal in all 50 states. The idea stems back to 17th century
England. Writings by Sir Matthew Hale indicate some of the foundation
for this idea that husbands are insulated from rape charges by the
"marital contract." He
[[wrote](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=104071&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historia_Placitorum_Coron%25C3%25A6){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} that a \"husband cannot
be guilty of a rape committed by himself upon his lawful wife, for by
their mutual matrimonial consent and contract the wife hath given up
herself in this kind to her husband which she cannot retract.\" The
[[Model Penal
Code](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b93273&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_Penal_Code){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} retained that idea,
defining rape as a crime committed when "a male \[...\] has sexual
intercourse with a female **not his wife**."

Staring around the mid 1970s (following the womens' rights movements in
the United States), the view of spousal rape began to change. In 1984,
the New York State Court of Appeals heard the case of [[*People v.
Liberta*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d0ee7a&url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/women-and-justice/resource/people_v_liberta){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="cornell.edu"}]{.qlink_container}, and in it, judge [[Sol
Wachtler](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=00ba5b&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_Wachtler){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} stated that \"a marriage
license should not be viewed as a license for a husband to forcibly rape
his wife with impunity. A married woman has the same right to control
her own body as does an unmarried woman.\"

Beginning in the mid 1970s, states started removing spouse exceptions
from their rape laws, and by 1993, marital rape (or spousal rape) was a
crime in all 50 states.
