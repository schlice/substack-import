**Content:** [The Presidential Advance Team goes in and prepares a
location for the President\'s arrival. The team includes Secret Service,
White House staff, and military personnel (and volunteers!), and they
pre-arrange and coordinate everything the President will be doing, as
early as two weeks before the Presidnt is to arrive at a particular
location. The vehicles get delivered by military transport aircraft,
most notably the President\'s armored limo, affectionately referred to
as \"the Beast,\" a day or two before the President arrives.\
