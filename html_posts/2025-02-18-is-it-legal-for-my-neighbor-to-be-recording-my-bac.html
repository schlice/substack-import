The answer, as with all legal answers, is "it depends."

In most cases in most places around the United States, you are allowed
to use a security camera to protect your property, even if it
incidentally captures your neighbor's property.

That word, *incidentally,* means that the capture of the neighbor's
property is *incidental* to the capture of your own property. In other
words, if the camera is *primarily* capturing your yard, but it is also
*incidentally* capturing your neighbor's yard, then that incidental
capture is acceptable.

The only time that it would not be acceptable (and a situation in which
local code enforcement might be able to step in) is if your camera is
*primarily* capturing the neighbor's yard and only *incidentally* (or
not at all) capturing your own yard.

\

Now, when it comes to **backyards**, we get into much different
territory. There is, at least, a modicum of privacy expected in a
backyard, especially one surrounded by a privacy fence. There is, at
least, an expectation that **from the ground level**, there is limited
to no visibility into that backyard.

Now, if your neighbor has a two-story house, then it's a foregone
conclusion that they can see into your backyard. Whether they use their
eyeballs from a second-story window or a security camera is irrelevant.

But if they only have a one-story house, and they have positioned their
camera in a high location, now you have to go back to what I said in the
first section: it depends on what the camera is *primarily* capturing,
and what the camera is *incidentally* capturing.

\

So how do you deal with this situation? There are a number of ways to
address it. You can install more tall stuff. Install privacy netting
over the top of your backyard.

Or, you could go old school. And by "old school," I mean do what polite
society used to do back in the day: ***talk to each other***. Express
your concern that their security camera may incidentally be looking into
your yard and you're not entirely comfortable with that. Maybe assist
them with finding a camera location that more directly captures their
own yard while maybe seeing less of yours.

If worse comes to worse, hire an attorney in your area who specializes
in civil rights law and privacy matters to send a strongly worded
registered lawyer letter telling them that you are threatening legal
action if they don't move their camera, and then sue them for violations
of your right to privacy in your backyard.

There are other high-tech solutions you can employ; you can get some
really high power infrared floodlights and install them on your house
pointed right at their camera. For most surveillance cameras which are
tuned to use IR illuminators, any camera looking into your yard will
look like they're looking directly into the sun and they won't be able
to see a thing. When he asks you to shut them off you can tell him to go
kick rocks because you already tried to act neighborly and they didn't
listen.
