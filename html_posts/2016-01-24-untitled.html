You can\'t \"forget the Constitution.\" All laws are based off of the
Constitution, the \"supreme law of the land.\" Police departments are
developed, equipped, and funded through force of law. So \"forgetting\"
the Constitution is not feasible.

If you have an expectation that your police department is going to
defend you from crime, you may need to reset your expectations. If you
wanted a police department that was there to defend you and not just
enforce the law, you\'d have to pay ***much*** higher taxes, because
you\'d need approximately 50 times the officers than you have now. Then,
and only then, might the police be of sufficient numbers to defend you
against crime, and between you and me, that looks too much like a police
state for my taste.

Remember the old saying: *when seconds count, the police are only
minutes away.*

Based on the legal definition of a police force as \"law enforcement\"
and not a \"public defense force,\" the police are not required to
protect you from crime. It would be logistically impossible to
**expect** that the police will defend you from crime.

The simple fact is that the police can\'t get to you fast enough to
**prevent** crime from happening. It is up to you to safeguard yourself
and your family. If you are unable or unwilling to do so, you should
move to a gated community, a condominium building with private security,
or hire your own private security. The law says that the government
can\'t deny you life, liberty or property without due process, but the
law doesn\'t say that you have the right to government aid, even when
that aid would safeguard your life, liberty or property, the very same
rights the government is not allowed to take from you.
