To add to

answer, I think you would be hard-pressed to categorize such a business
as a *scam*.

What it may be, more than a scam, is a very expensive, very unproven,
treatment option. Some people have found great success with stem cell
treatment. Some stem cell treatments (for example, treatment which
completely rebuilds your immune system using stem cells, after
destroying it with chemotherapy) are very dangerous and should only be
used when there are **zero** other options for treating your disease.

Stem cell treatments have not been proven to be effective. They haven't
been recognized by any governing body as a treatment which does anything
it claims to do. That doesn't mean it may not work. It just means that
it may not work with any regularity, or with any predictability. We also
don't know the *permanence* of such treatment. Does it wear off in a
year? Five years? Are there any undesirable side effects? Has anyone who
has received this treatment had his/her disease return, ever? And most
importantly for any treatment, how *safe* is it? What's the risk? Can it
kill you? Basically, is the treatment worse than the disease?

Until we know the answers to these questions, stem cell treatment is
still in its young, development phase. Not yet ready, IMHO, for prime
time.
