What in the world are you talking about? Any baritone worth his salt can
sing this in its traditional key of Ab. I sing it routinely. I was a
singer for the Sky Sox a few seasons ago in Colorado Springs, and I sang
Opening Day for the Sox. Tons of fun. I also sang for military events.

Secondly, the other verses do not involve slavery. I wonder if you're
worried about the first line in the fourth verse: "Oh thus be it ever,
when freemen shall stand". "Freemen" was less about African slaves and
was more about indentured servants who were released from their
financial obligations. And even at the time, it had little to do with
slavery; it was a condition to vote:

> In the Massachusetts Bay Colony, a man had to be a member of the
> Church to be a freeman; in neighboring Plymouth Colony a man did not
> need to be a member of the Church, but he had to be elected to this
> privilege by the General Court. Being a freeman carried with it the
> right to vote, and in Plymouth only freemen could vote by
> 1632.[\[1\]](#tmhOI){#cite-tmhOI .citation_link}

Regardless, it expresses an idea about people, not a condoning of
slavery. There is no need to change the word.

The song is derived from a poem written by Francis Scott Key while he
was on a ship watching the attack on Fort McHenry on September 14, 1814.
Come the morning light, he was relieved to see that the American flag
was still waving over the Fort: the British were unable to take the
fort. His joy at seeing the flag still waving inspired him to pen the
poem. The poem was printed in newspapers, and yes, it was eventually set
to music, a popular English drinking tune called "To Anacreon in Heaven"
by composer John Stafford Smith. Nevertheless, the song stuck, and
people started calling it "The Star-Spangled Banner" and in 1916,
President Woodrow Wilson declared that it would be performed at all
official events. Congress adopted it as our national anthem on March 3,
1931.

Many things we did as early colonists are holdovers from our time as
British subjects, and many of our popular cultural ideas of the time
were similarly holdovers from British times. For example, "My Country
'Tis Of Thee," the *de facto* National Anthem until The Star Spangled
Banner was adopted in 1931, is set to music that was or is used around
the world as national anthems:

Part of the reason that we're not going to replace it follows the same
logic by which we're not going to remove "In God We Trust" from our
money, or remove it as our national motto. We've reaffirmed the motto
several times. Congress has passed several laws reaffirming our national
motto, most recently in 2006. The courts have ruled that it does not
violate the separation of church and state, calling it "ceremonial
Deism." It's part of our national heritage.

Similarly, "The Star-Spangled Banner" is part of our national heritage,
warts and all (if there are any).

Original question:

**Isn\'t it time that America replaces it\'s national anthem? First,
almost no one has the vocal range to sing it. Second, the music is a
purloined British drinking song. Third, the other verses involve
slavery.**
