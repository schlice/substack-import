As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."

Check your Covenants, Conditions, Rules & Regulations (CCR&R) documents
for your HOA. All HOAs have them, and they are on file with your local
government if you can't find them.

Your HOA may even have a separate Architecture Review group which may
have its own guidelines published.

In MOST cases, *if you repaint with* ***the same color that was
previously approved***, this is not considered an exterior "change."
This is considered "standard maintenance" which you are required to do,
and does not require additional approval. Note that some HOAs still
require pre-approval, even if you are repainting with the same color.
Check your Rules and Regulations document to be sure.

In ALL cases, *if you are going to* ***change the color of your
house****,* this IS considered to be an exterior "change," and your HOA
will need to approve your change before you make it.

And since I can't stress this point enough, **before beginning any work
on the exterior of your home**, check your HOA Governing Documents and
be sure you understand the requirements. Ask your Architecture Review
group or your HOA Board members if you have questions.
