**How is it that there is no provision in the constitution of the united
states to prevent a president from firing the lead investigator in an
ongoing case against him?**

Mostly because it's unnecessary.

*Even if* the special prosecutor found evidence of a crime committed by
the president while he was in office, the president still can't be
indicted and charged.

If the special prosecutor was removed from office (somehow) and was
unable to continue his investigation, the remedy is the same as if the
special prosecutor found evidence of a crime.

The only Constitutional remedy is to impeach the president and remove
him from office. If Congress watched the president fire the lead
investigator in a case against him, the remedy is exactly the same as if
actual crimes were found to have taken place.

Once that president is no longer president, he can be indicted and tried
as an ordinary citizen.
