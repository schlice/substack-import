**Content:** []{.rendered_qtext}

1.  Open the Google app.
2.  Click on your name in the upper left. The Settings box appears.
3.  Choose Search Settings.
4.  Ensure that in the SafeSearch Filters box, "Show most relevant
    results" is checked.
5.  Click Save
6.  Click Done.

If you want to turn off SafeSearch in the Safari Browser :

1.  Navigate to
    **[[google.com](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=20f739&url=http://google.com){.external_link
    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
    qt-tooltip="google.com"}]{.qlink_container}**
2.  Click on the gear in the upper right hand corner
3.  Ensure that in the SafeSearch Filters box, "Show most relevant
    results" is checked.

This setting will not be preserved unless you are signed in to Google.
If you've already set your search preferences in the app and then you
log in to Google in the browser, your settings will follow.
