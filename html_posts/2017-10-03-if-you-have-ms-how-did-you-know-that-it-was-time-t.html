I didn't. My wife did.

I woke up with eye issues one morning. Blurry vision and pain in my eye,
and when I went into the dark closet, sparklers around the outside of my
vision. I've had 20/15 vision since I was a kid, and my wife has had bad
eyes since she was a kid. She's very knowledgeable (and sensitive) about
eye issues. When I told her what was happening in my eye, she
immediately made me cancel my business trip and made me an appointment
with her ophthalmologist.

I explained my symptoms to him, and he knew right away that I had ON
(optic neuritis). More nefarious, of course, is the cause. In almost
half of patients my age (I was in my 30s at the time), it had no cause.
It would simply resolve itself. In the other half, it's MS. He told me
to go back to my GP and get an MRI scheduled.

Within a few weeks, I was "in the tube" for my first MRI. The doctor
called me back the same day (that's never good, by the way). He told me
that I needed to find a good neurologist, because my MRI had all the
signs of someone who had MS.

So to answer your question, the only reason I went to the doctor when I
did is because my wife cares more about me than I do.
