**What factors, other than racism, may have contributed to the violence
inflicted on young black men by police officers in the U.S.?**

Other than racism, here are some of the factors which may have
contributed to violence\* inflicted on young black men by police
officers in the US:

1.  They physically attacked police officers.
2.  They acted in an overtly aggressive way.
3.  They actively resisted arrest.
4.  They pointed weapons at police officers.
5.  They fit the description of a person who recently committed a
    violent crime in the area, and they failed to stop when told to
    stop.
6.  They did or said any number of other things which indicated to the
    arresting officer that the person had the intent to harm them.

\* Police takedown procedures always *look* violent. However, how many
times have you seen a person *violently* taken down by a police officer
*not* walking away under his own power? If *actual violence* were
occurring, wouldn't these people be going away on stretchers in
ambulances, or worse, in body bags? And if this so-called "violence"
were endemic, wouldn't the stretcher or body bag transport happen far
more often than it does today?
