**Does the United States Air Force have doctrine that would let them ram
a hijacked plane basically committing suicide?**

A [[ramming
attack](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a93606&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_ramming){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} is definitely a method
that a pilot can use to bring down an opposing aircraft. It was far more
successful (and survivable) in the prop age than it is in the jet age,
but it is still a somewhat survivable attack, depending on
circumstances.

There is no "rule" that says that a hijacked plane must be rammed.
Ramming is an option when armaments are depleted or jammed and the
opposing aircraft must be brought down. Our pilots will accomplish the
mission, even if it places them at risk of not returning safely to the
ground. Circumstances will always dictate how we will respond; there is
no doctrine that mandates any specific response.
