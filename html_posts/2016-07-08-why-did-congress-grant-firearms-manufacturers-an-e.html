Let's be clear: **The law does not protect firearms manufacturers from
product liability lawsuits.** That statement is patently false.

As most of the other answers here have stated, anti-gun groups attempted
to sue firearms manufacturers during *the exact opposite* of product
liability cases. They attempted to sue firearms manufacturers when their
product worked *exactly as designed*. The firearm worked properly and
did not injure the user. Yet people still sought to sue firearms
manufacturers when their products killed people, as if that was not the
intention of the person using the firearm.

Could you see the shooter in such a circumstance? "Wha? I thought this
was a lighter!"

The idea behind the anti-gun groups' logic was that if we can't change
the Constitution, we'll just sue gun manufacturers every time their
product is used to kill someone, even if the lawsuit has no merit. You
may not know this, but it costs *a lot of money* to defend yourself
against a lawsuit, even if the suit has no merit. If they do it enough,
they can bankrupt a company.

To combat this predatory practice of lawsuits, Congress passed the
***Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act*** (PLCAA). This law
protects gun manufacturers from unlawful, predatory lawsuits designed to
bankrupt companies out of existence, even when there is no product
liability. Gun manufacturers can still be sued for product liability, if
their product malfunctions and injures the user.

But let's be clear here. **Guns are designed to kill**. Suing the
manufacturer when a product works as designed is not a proper use of the
legal system.
