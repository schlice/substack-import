**Is it legal for a business to audio/video record you in a lobby?**

While some states have different rules regarding video recording, in the
majority of locations, the answer is mostly **yes**. The facility can
**video** record you; but laws are still wildly different regarding
**audio** recording.

For the purpose of the remainder of this answer, we will assume that you
are talking about a building in the United States.

If you are referring to a private or government building which is open
to the public, the owner of the building can pretty much record using
video in any publicly-accessible area of the building (including the
lobby) with the exception of areas which have an implied right of
privacy (i.e. bathrooms, locker rooms, changing rooms, etc). The owner
can use that video for whatever lawful purpose they want, such as
prevention of theft or vandalism, or to protect against trespassing.
Some states will require that a sign be posted indicating that video
recording is being used, others do not. You would see that sign on the
outer door, and entrance into the building signifies your understanding
of and agreement to that recording.

Audio recordings are a completely different story. In most states, audio
recordings still follow the laws regarding **consent to recording** that
were established with telephone wiretapping laws, and states have
varying laws regarding what level of consent is required of the
participants in a recorded audio conversation before that recording can
be used as evidence in court. It is for this reason that most
surveillance cameras in most buildings will only record video, and not
audio.
