**Content:** [If a police officer misplaces his weapon, he can get
another one from police issue, but he will likely have to reimburse the
cost of the lost one. There will also likely be a disciplinary action
taken.\
\
If his weapon is stolen, and a police report has been filed along with
the burglary, he can get another weapon issued without charge.\
\
Department policies differ on what to do in that instance, as it is very
rare.\
\
Besides, he\'ll likely face far more ridicule at the hands of his fellow
officers than any discipline the department could dish
out.]{.rendered_qtext}
