**Content:** [Phil and Claire\'s parenting style is *dramatized*.\
\
Have you ever seen the front of a cereal box where it shows you an
extreme close-up of the cereal? It always has some fine print in the
corner which says something along the lines of \"Enlarged to show
texture.\"\
\
As if you didn\'t know that the actual nugget of cereal was much smaller
than the one pictured on the box (who knows, some may).\
\
When you see the parenting style on TV, it is dramatized. That means it
is exaggerated to point out the texture. It is aggrandized to splay out
the nuances, the foibles, and the tribulations of parenting. We laugh as
parents because we\'ve all felt that way at one time or another.\
\
We have felt that way; we don\'t act that way.\
\
Most parents in the US do not act the way that Phil and Claire do, but
they can sympathize because they feel as if they\'ve been there at least
once in their lives.\
\
That\'s what makes television *engaging*; you can relate to what you\'re
seeing.\
\
But it also makes television dramas (or comedies) a *poor reflection of
reality*.\
\
I think sometimes, television may be a fairer reflection of reality than
we may admit. But most of the time, television is a dramatization of
reality, and doesn\'t accurately reflect how most people
live.]{.rendered_qtext}
