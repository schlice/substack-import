In the vast majority of cases, "Can God" questions can be answered with
"Yes, God can."

But not always.

Some things God cannot do:

- God cannot violate His nature. For example, God cannot sin, so God
  cannot do anything sinful or condone sin.
- God cannot do things which are not possible to do in our world. The
  "gotcha" question which comes to mind is "Can God make a rock so heavy
  that even He can't lift it?" No, God can't because such a rock would
  be larger than the entire universe, and it is not possible to create
  something so large that it would exceed the size of the universe.
- God cannot create other infinite beings. God can create *finite*
  beings, but God cannot create other infinite beings. The definition of
  an infinite being means *complete*. God is lacking nothing. If God
  lacks something, then He is not complete, and thus is not infinite. If
  there is more than one infinite being, then in order to distinguish
  between the two, one must lack something that the other has, and this
  violates the very nature of an infinite being.

\

Now to answer the question. Since Odin, while powerful, is not
*infinite*, then yes, God could create a creature ***like*** Odin. He
wouldn't be a "god" per se (God said that you shall have no other gods
but me), but maybe He could create a *demi-God*. Not worthy of worship,
but powerful nonetheless, although not more powerful than God Himself.
