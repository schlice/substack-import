So you're saying that the crown of thorns is representative of poverty,
because pain can be considered a communicable disease?

These questions are always so striking. I love the ones which ascribe
some hidden meaning to, say, the seventh word in every book of the
Bible, or something like that. I saw one on TikTok not too long ago; I
just sorta scrolled past it.

So when speaking of the number 7, it is very symbolic in the Bible. The
number 7 indicates *completeness,* where the number 6 indicates
incompleteness. *Three* 7's indicates the perfect completeness, while
three 6's indicates the perfect incompleteness (thus, when Revelation
says that the number 666 is the number of the beast, this is at least
partially what it is referring to).

But let's be honest. Sometimes in the Bible, a 7 is just a 7.

So while the crown of thorns which was placed on Jesus' head indeed
brought pain, it was more about ***mockery*** than pain. When they were
done flailing Him (and if you don't know what that is, look it up, but
beware, it's not for those with weak stomachs), along with the crown,
they put a reed in His hand, representing a king's staff, and put a
purple robe on Him, and then they mockingly bowed down to Him, laughing,
saying "All hail, the King of the Jews!" They thought it was quite
funny. The crown of thorns was the centerpiece of their mockery. They
took something which was a symbol of office, of royalty and majesty, and
turned it into a symbol of ridicule, derision, and contempt.

So what ***should*** we take from the crown? Two things:

1.  Jesus is, and always will be, an *actual* King. Revelation 19:16
    says, "On his robe and on his thigh he has a name written, King of
    kings and Lord of lords." One day, every knee will bow, and every
    tongue will confess that Jesus is Lord (Philippians 2:10--11).
2.  Jesus was willing to endure the pain and humiliation of the crown of
    thorns, **for us**.

The physical crown of thorns is now gone, but Jesus now has been given a
*new* crown, one which no one can ever usurp, and one which He shall
wear for all eternity.
