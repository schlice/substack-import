The Supreme Court can't "pick and choose" what to decide. They can only
decide the cases which are appealed to them.

The case in question was in regards to OSHA's vaccine mandate for
businesses and for healthcare workers. It did not have anything to do
with federal contractors.

*That* case was recently decided in Texas, and they decided to block the
federal employee vaccine mandate as well:

It's kinda OBE at this point as something like 95% of federal workers
are already vaccinated, but at least the others won't face loss of their
job for remaining unvaccinated, or face the health risks of getting
vaccinated after already having COVID.

Original question:

Why didn't the Supreme Court decision also address the civilian federal
contractors besides the private employers and healthcare workers?
