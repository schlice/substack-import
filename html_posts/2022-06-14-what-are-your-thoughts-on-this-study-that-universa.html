The funny part about this study is that it reveals that Trump and the
Conservatives were right all along about how to keep deaths from COVID
down, and the government didn't listen.

The study posits that people died during COVID because they had
**comorbidities**. If we would have had universal health care, the study
suggests, these comorbidities would have been managed because people
would have been able to afford to go to the doctor. And if those
comorbidities were managed better, then those people (when they
contracted COVID) wouldn't have died.

It's an interesting line of logic. But it just goes to prove that the
way to save lives during COVID was to protect those with comorbidities.
**Which is precisely what the "marginalized" health experts (and
Conservatives) were saying.**

In other words, what this study should be saying is that **you should
have listened to the other health experts** and you should have
**targeted your protection towards people who had pre-existing health
conditions**, and left the healthy to leave their homes and run their
businesses. Instead, the heavy-handed approach we did take has left the
economy in shambles, and combined with politics and
politically-motivated policies, have left us with supply chain
nightmares which will take years to undo, and are pushing us toward the
edge of an economic recession...

...which will ultimately cost more lives.
