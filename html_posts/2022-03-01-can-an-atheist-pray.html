Sure, but it doesn't make sense. It makes as much sense for an atheist
to pray as it does for me to go to the church of the Flying Spaghetti
Monster. I can physically be in the room and do all the things they do,
but if I don't believe in it, it doesn't make me a Pastafarian.

Same holds true for the atheist. Atheists can pray, but if there is no
belief behind what they say, they're just speaking words.

It is the *faith* that gives the prayer its power, not the *words*.
