**Content:** [*Well all guns are designed to kill.*\
*whether its fully auto, semi auto, lever action , pump or bolt action
they are still more deadly than a knife or club.*\
\
This, sadly, is incorrect. Guns are more *efficient* at killing than
knives or clubs, but to say that they are more *deadly* is
[[incorrect.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=fad9f1&url=http://ishttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akihabara_massacre){.external_link

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container} Just ask the
samurai from Japan just how deadly someone with a sword can be. Guns are
**equalizers**, in that you don\'t need exceptional physical prowess to
wield one effectively. A small woman can take down a large man with a
gun, more efficiently than she could with a knife or club.\
\
*does the \"right to bear arms\" cover bombs as well, or are they
illegal?*\
The right to bear arms does not cover mass-casualty devices like
Claymore mines or grenades. The National Firearms Act of 1938 has made
sure of that, and it has been just fine so far. So no, the right to bear
arms does not cover bombs.\
\
*And you can own fully automatic weapons outside of the armed
services.*\
Yes, with a Federal Firearms License. They are not easy or cheap to come
by, and they will do more background checking than you get when you walk
into your local gun store to by a handgun. The point here is that it\'s
highly unlikely that someone would obtain a Federal Firearms License
just to buy an automatic weapon to commit crimes with. They\'re more
likely to buy such a weapon on the black market. One thing which has
been made clear throughout history:\
\
**Criminals, almost to a person, don\'t follow laws.**\
\
So if someone wants to kill lots of people, there\'s a fair chance that
he\'s not going to follow laws to do it. They probably won\'t legally
buy firearms from your local store; they\'ll probably buy an illegal
fully-automatic weapon from their local black market gun
dealer.]{.rendered_qtext}
