The bipartisan "Save Our Seas Act of 2018" will do a few things:

> *The Save Our Seas Act will help address this problem by extending the
> Marine Debris Program for five additional years. We also are
> strengthening that up to improve waste management overseas and clean
> up our nation's water. We will boost the federal government's response
> to ocean waste by authorizing the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
> Administration to declare severe marine debris events\[.\]*
>
> \[...\]
>
> *This legislation will release funds to states for cleanup and for
> response efforts. And we will be responding and very strongly.*
