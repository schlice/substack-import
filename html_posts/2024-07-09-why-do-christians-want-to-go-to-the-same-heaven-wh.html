Because the fact that notorious creatures *came from* there doesn't
indict the **place**. It indicts the **creature**.

Heaven is still the ultimate destination for us. I'm looking forward to

Besides, Satan holds no power over us. We are adopted into God's family.
We are children of God. As such, we have full authority over Satan, and
can command him to flee from us. So he's just an annoying little gnat to
me.
