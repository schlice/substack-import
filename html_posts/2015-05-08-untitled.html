**Content:** [Hiring a hitman is, at best, aiding and abetting, at
worst, conspiracy to commit murder, which is charged as harshly as the
murder itself. The thought plays not into it at all, as it is the act of
money exchanging hands that constitutes the overt action of committing
the crime of conspiracy.\
\
Verbalizing a Threat, or conveyance of a threat by other means is a
crime already. Making a threat has been a crime the whole time. It is
the act of conveying the threat through spoken words or through printed
or electronic means of conveyance that make it a crime.\
\
We don\'t need a new crime to supplement a crime we already have. It\'s
like making a new crime called killing when we already have crimes for
murder and manslaughter that cover the instances when you unlawfully
take the life of another.\
\
Hate crimes are generally modifiers to existing crimes. A hate crime is
generally charged more severely than the actual crime itself. And the
only thing we are determining is the thought, the attitude, behind the
person committing the crime. It\'s, in my opinion, a criminalization of
thought, and in all cases (until *Minority Report* becomes a reality) is
subjective, and shakily so: trying to determine what someone was
thinking based on actions.\
\
I just don\'t think it makes for good law.]{.rendered_qtext}
