**Can I file a small claims case against an auto shop for replacing my
engine and other unsafe parts of my car without my permission?**

In the United States, you can sue anyone for anything.

How likely you are to prevail is really what's at issue.

As in most civil suits, you have to show some *harm* was done. When you
show the harm which was done, you can request that the court award some
form of remuneration for that harm.

Here are the types of damages you can recoup in a civil court case:

> **Compensatory**
>
> Compensatory damages are typically sought in personal injury or
> property damage suits. The person filing the suit may ask for
> compensation for a variety of issues, such as lost income, property
> repairs and medical care. Compensatory damages seek an amount for
> actual losses.
>
> **General**
>
> General damages are often sought in conjunction with compensatory
> claims. General damages do not involve any direct financial loss by a
> plaintiff; examples of general damages can include mental anguish,
> pain and suffering, loss of consortium with a spouse or loss of the
> use of a piece of property. They also may be sought for anticipated
> future loss of earning power.
>
> **Punitive**
>
> Punitive damages, as the name implies, are meant to punish a
> defendant. They are sought in cases where a plaintiff claims
> negligence or misconduct on the part of the defendant. Punitive damage
> awards can often far exceed compensatory damages. Many noted cases

> against a large corporation. Such awards, however, often are
> successfully appealed and the awards cut significantly.
>
> **Nominal**
>
> At the opposite end of financial awards from punitive amounts are
> those for nominal damages. These generally come when a defendant is
> found guilty but only a small amount is awarded because the damage
> done to the plaintiff was slight.
>
> **Court Costs**
>
> Filing a suit can be an expensive proposition, with a variety of fees
> assessed to plaintiffs for legal steps such as filing and processing,
> court transcripts and depositions. Often, the person filing the suit
> will ask that the defendant be ordered to pay for court costs
> associated with the suit. The plaintiff also may request that attorney
> fees be paid by the party being sued as
> well.[\[1\]](#jtfbp){#cite-jtfbp .citation_link}

The way this would probably play out: since you did not authorize the
repairs, you are not under any obligation to pay for them, or the parts
and labor which were put into them. The shop is still liable for its
work, and any warranties will still attach to the work. For example, if
the engine which was replaced without your permission fails within the
shop's standard warranty period, they will still be required to fix it.

In this case, it would be up to the shop to sue you to try to get you to
pay for the work they did, and your defense would be that you never
authorized that work to be performed.
