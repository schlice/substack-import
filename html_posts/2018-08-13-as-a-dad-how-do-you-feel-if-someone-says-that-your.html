**As a dad, how do you feel if someone says that your baby looks
absolutely like the mom?**

You mean that my baby didn't inherit my HUGE Italian nose and greasy
skin? I'm crushed.

To be fair though, women always told me (as a child) how much they loved
my eyelashes. I wouldn't have minded if my boys had inherited those. I
really never knew what to say when they told me that. "Thanks" always
seemed wrong since I didn't do anything to get them.
