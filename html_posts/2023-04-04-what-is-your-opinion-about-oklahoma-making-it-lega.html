So this is a bit old, as Oklahoma did this two years ago. I have a
feeling that your tool which is auto-generating questions may have an
issue.

Anyway, this legislation came during a time when the nation was
struggling with racial bias, abusive policing, and the right to protest.
Oklahoma wanted to remind protesters that they have a right to protest,
but they do not have a right to disrupt lawful commerce and block
roadways to do so. Protesters can protest, but they must also recognize
that the state has the right to control the time, place, and manner of
their protest without limiting the right to protest. Protesters feel
that their message is not as impactful when people are not
inconvenienced by it, but this is flawed thinking.

The provision regarding "running over protesters" reiterates the fact
that people should not be forced to remain in fear for their lives
simply because someone is protesting in a street. You don't have the
right to be free from consequences if you are unlawfully protesting. And
if you threaten someone inside of their vehicle, and they have a
"reasonable belief" that they are in danger, they are now free from
criminal or civil liability in Oklahoma if they injure or kill you with
their vehicle while they are "fleeing from a riot."
