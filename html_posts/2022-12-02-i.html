The most common timeframe for someone to develop MS is between the ages
of 20 and 50. So you're right on the edge of the most common time to
develop the disease. Although MS can occur in much younger people
(called "pediatric MS") or much older people (called "geriatric MS"),
those cases are much less common.

But if you are "afraid that you might have MS," don't be. First, see a
doctor and discuss your symptoms. You may be referred to a neurologist
to run some tests which may include an MRI to look for evidence of MS.

Don't be afraid, be informed.
