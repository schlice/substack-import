If a same-sex officer cannot be brought to the scene within a reasonable
timeframe, we can use the back of the hand to search any sensitive
areas.

The back of the hand is still sensitive enough to feel if anything
besides body is inside the undergarments, and it's exceedingly difficult
to be accused of groping someone with the back of your hand.
