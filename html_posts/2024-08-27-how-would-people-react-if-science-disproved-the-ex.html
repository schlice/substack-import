People would know that the world has ended.

Science cannot prove non-existence. Legal scholar and philosopher
Mortimer Adler says, \"An affirmative existential proposition can be
proved, but a negative existential proposition---one that denies the
existence of something---cannot be proved.\"

For example, I could tell you that red squirrels exist, and you could
tell me that red squirrels do not exist. To prove my statement, I only
need to find evidence of one red squirrel somewhere. But to prove your
statement, you would literally need to be everywhere all at once in all
of history so that you could prove that red squirrels do not exist, and
never did exist. Doing that is literally not possible.

And just because you haven't discovered a red squirrel doesn't mean that
one does not exist.
