No. Only sentient creatures even have the capacity for free will, and
only humans have received the gift of free will from God. Inanimate
objects like asteroids have no will of their own.

> Why do people blame God for not intervening?

Because they reason that because God is so powerful, and Christians
claim He is infinitely loving, He should be intervening and protecting
us from all harm. But that's not only illogical, it's something that no
one has ever said of Christianity.

I've answered the question about why bad things happen to good people
before, so let me link to it for you to read over. Here's one question
about the pandemic I answered:
