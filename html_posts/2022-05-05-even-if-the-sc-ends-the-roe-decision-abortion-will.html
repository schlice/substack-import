First, let's correct your statement-question.

If *Roe* is overturned, whether or not abortion is legal becomes a
question to be answered by each state and the state legislature therein.
It returns to something that the people can vote on, by electing
representatives that will adjust abortion rules in their state depending
on what the majority of voters in that state want. Today, it is the
Supreme Court which decided this issue, a group of nine unelected judges
with lifetime appointments.

Activists are militant because *Roe is symbolic.* Overturning *Roe*
means that their precious right to kill humans is not actually a right
found in the Constitution, but is a *privilege* afforded by law, and
each state can decide if they want to allow it or not. They don't want
that. They want to have the Constitutional right to kill humans.

They want rights to comport with their moral views, which allow them to
place differential value on human life depending on its temporal
locality.

Original question:

Even if the SC ends the Roe decision, abortion will be legal and
available for every women in the US, so why are activists so militant?
Is this more about votes than reality? Why or why not?
