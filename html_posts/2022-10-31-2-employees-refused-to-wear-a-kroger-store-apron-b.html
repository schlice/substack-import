No, they refuse to remain employees.

Kroger has the right to set uniforms. Employees do not have the freedom
to not wear the employer\'s uniform because of any reason.

That\'s grounds for immediate termination.

Own your own business, set your own rules. Work for someone else, you
play by their rules.

Original question:

2 employees refused to wear a Kroger store apron because it has a multi
colored heart, as they claimed it was \"against their religion\". Do
they also refuse to sell rainbow sprinkles, or rainbow sherbet?
