You know for sure that what you are being led to do is actually the
voice of the Spirit *when it aligns with the truth.* The truth is found
in the Bible.

If you're being told to blow up an airplane, it's probably not the
truth, as murder is specifically called out as sinful. But if you're
being told to open up a food distribution program for the hungry in your
neighborhood after you discover that your neighborhood doesn't have one,
there's a good chance you're being led by the Spirit into that action.

If you are still having difficulty discerning God's voice among all the
other voices we are bombarded with (including the voice of Satan lying
to you), *talk to someone about it*. Talk to a trusted pastor or a
Christian friend. Heck, post it here in **Christians and Christianity**.
We have some amazing Christians here who can help you work through what
you're being led to do.
