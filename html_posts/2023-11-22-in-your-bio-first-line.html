It shouldn't be. It is simply a statement of fact.

If you believe it is contentious, then you are taking exception to it. I
was once Catholic but am no longer so. Clearly (and in my opinion,
obviously), I believe that my current set of religious practices is
*better* than what I was experiencing as a Catholic. That should be
fairly obvious and not surprising.

Perhaps you believe that Catholicism is the one true religion. That's
okay. You're welcome to your beliefs. But I have come to believe that
certain church practices (transubstantiation, sprinkle baptism,
adoration, etc) are unbiblical, so I left the church.

It's pretty much that simple.
