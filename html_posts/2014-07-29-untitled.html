**Content:** [Preventing any of these scenarios is not the purpose of
laws. They may be desirable outcomes, but they are not things that we
should be writing laws to change. Laws are not designed to protect me
from me. They\'re designed to protect me from you. So if you not wearing
your seat belt is a danger to me, then you have to wear it. Laws that
protect you from you are generally not good law.]{.rendered_qtext}
