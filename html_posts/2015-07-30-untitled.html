**Content:** [Mass shootings do not occur daily. I suppose it depends on
your definition of \"mass shooting\" since there isn\'t a true
definition of it yet. We had a few, but I certainly don\'t agree with
206 so far in 2015.\
\
In the US, self defense DOES entail gun ownership. And until the Second
Amendment is repealed, it always will. That\'s how the US was designed.
The country was designed around the freedom to own guns. You would have
to completely dismantle the Constitution and start over again if you
want to eliminate public ownership of guns.\
\
So anything you want to do to limit civilian ownership of guns has to be
done within the framework that US citizens will always be afforded the
right to own and use guns.]{.rendered_qtext}
