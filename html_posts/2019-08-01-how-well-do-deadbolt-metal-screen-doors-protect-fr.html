**How well do deadbolt metal screen doors protect from home invasions?**

Deadbolt security screen doors provide an extra layer of security in
front of your entry door. They are usually made with 18 or 22 gauge
steel, so they are relatively strong. The deadbolt is "keyed" on both
sides, which means you need a key to open it from either side. In this
way, a thief can't simply cut the insect screen and reach in and unlock
the door. In order to be secure, the deadbolt must be locked with a key
from the inside. The key should still be accessible somewhere inside the
house near the door, so you can get out if you need to.

But let's not forget: locked doors are designed to keep honest people
out. Criminals will always find a way in to your house; with enough time
and privacy, you can get into any door. Adding layers of security just
makes it that much more difficult for even the most determined criminal
to enter the house there.
