Leave New Jersey and move to a state with more friendly laws.

Seriously, I wouldn't expect NJ to change any time soon. NJ is a "duty
to retreat" state, so if you do defend yourself, but they find that you
could have run away instead of doing so, you could be charged with a
crime.

This means that New Jersey is a great place to be a criminal.

That's why you should do the sensible thing and move.
