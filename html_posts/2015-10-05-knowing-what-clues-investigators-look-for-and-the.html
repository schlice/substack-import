**Content:** [I can tell you from personal experience that the traits
which make one an effective cop are the same traits which make one an
effective criminal.\
\
There is a *line* that officers don\'t cross, but remember, it\'s a
*line*, not a *wall*. It is a line of morality and adherence to the law.
Every person approaches that line throughout their lives. Officers
routinely approach that line throughout their careers. People who have a
skewed sense of right and wrong can routinely cross that line and feel
no remorse for doing so. Thankfully, most officers do the job because
they have a very strong sense of right and wrong, and a very strong
sense of justice and morality. They can approach that line and walk
away, and be no worse for wear from doing it.]{.rendered_qtext}
