Yes, no and no. In most states, even California, landlords in apartment
complexes *can* install cameras (with no audio) in common areas (such as
shared hallways), but they cannot install cameras inside of apartments.

In California, if you are renting a **house**, it becomes a little
trickier, as privacy laws are a little tougher.

If the entire house is being rented, you may not install cameras
anywhere inside the house. Since the tenant is renting the entire house,
they have a reasonable expectation of privacy inside the entire house.
You may install cameras on the **outside** of the house, and you can
even install a doorbell-style camera, but cameras cannot be installed
inside the house.

If you are just renting a room out to someone, or multiple rooms to
multiple someones, it is at least potentially legal to have cameras in
common areas (living rooms, kitchens, etc), but never in any area for
which there is a reasonable expectation of privacy (bedrooms, bathrooms,
etc). **The cameras cannot record audio,** and **notice must be posted
before entering the house that cameras are in use in the common areas**.
Even so, there are significant privacy concerns in California, so this
may present legal challenges.

While it *should be* legal in California to install a camera given the
above stipulations, I would strongly suggest that for this use case
specifically, if you are a landlord renting a house to multiple people,
you consult with an attorney in your area before installing cameras in
this way.
