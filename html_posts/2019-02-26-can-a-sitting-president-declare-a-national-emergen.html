**Can a sitting president declare a National Emergency for any reason
they want, or are there criteria for deciding what is and isn't an
acceptable reason?**

The National Emergencies Act does not define when a president can or
can't declare a national emergency. The President has wide discretion in
terms of determining when a national emergency is warranted, and when to
declare one. Congress decided not to constrain presidents in that way.

That doesn't mean that Congress can't look at the President's reasoning
for declaring a national emergency and find it suspect. Congress may
even believe that the President is abusing his power by declaring a
national emergency and impeach him for it.
