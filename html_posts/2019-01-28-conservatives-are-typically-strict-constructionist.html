**Conservatives are typically strict constructionists, so why do they
support Bible literacy classes in public schools?**

Let me phrase your question more neutrally:

**Does a Constitutional strict constructionist support Bible literacy
classes in public schools?**

The answer to this question is **yes**, strict constructionists do
support Bible literacy classes in public schools, since there is nothing
in the Constitution that prohibits it.

Note that there is a vast difference between ***teaching*** ***a
subject*** and ***advancing a particular religious belief.***

Remember this fact: **it is constitutional for a school to teach the
Bible; it is unconstitutional for a school to advance any particular
religious belief.**

In 1999, a guide endorsed by both religious and secular groups was
written entitled *The Bible in Public Schools: A First Amendment Guide.*
This guide has a number of important statements for any school wishing
to teach about any particular religious text and stay constitutional:

> The school\'s approach to religion is *academic*, not *devotional*.
>
> The school may strive for student *awareness* of religions, but should
> not press for student *acceptance* of any religion.
>
> The school may sponsor *study* about religion, but may not sponsor the
> *practice* of religion.
>
> The school may *educate* about all religions, but may not *promote or
> denigrate* any religion.[\[1\]](#jualZ){#cite-jualZ .citation_link}
