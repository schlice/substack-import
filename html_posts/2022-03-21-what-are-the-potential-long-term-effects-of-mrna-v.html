While there have not been any mRNA *vaccines* approved before the
COVID-19 vaccine, we've been running trials of these vaccines for
decades for various things including treating cancer and infectious
disease.

These studies show that there are no long-term effects that are
specifically related to using mRNA delivery methods. The only long-term
effects we have seen so far are related to the payload, not the delivery
method, and these are the same that we see with any vaccine.

Original question:

What are the potential long-term effects of mRNA vaccines?
