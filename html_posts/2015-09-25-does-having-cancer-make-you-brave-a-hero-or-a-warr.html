**Content:** [*Having* cancer makes you unlucky, or a patient, or as you
said, unfortunate.\
\
*Living with* cancer, and how you choose to live your life, can make you
brave, or a hero, or a warrior.\
\
The fact that your body develops in a certain way does not make you
brave. It makes you unique. How we react to our bodies and how we choose
to pattern our lives makes our lives characteristic. Depending on the
character of that life, words like brave or hero or warrior could be
appropriate characterizations.]{.rendered_qtext}
