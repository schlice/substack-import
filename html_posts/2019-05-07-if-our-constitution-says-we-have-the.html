**If our constitution says we have the \"right\" to travel, then why do
we have to have a driver\'s license?**

Oh boy, more [[sovereign
citizen](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c31cde&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_citizen_movement){.external_link

Since you mentioned the Constitution, let's discuss what it actually
says, and what it does not. The Constitution doesn't say anything about
the "right to travel." What it *does* say is that you have *freedom of
movement*, that you have the right to move between states at will. You
don't have to have "papers" in order to enter a state. You don't need a
visa from your home state to travel to another state, and states can't
set up situations where US citizens are subject to such provisions.

The Constitution also doesn't say anything about motor vehicle
regulation, and under the 10th Amendment, regulation of motor vehicles
(and anything else not explicitly mentioned by the Constitution) is left
to the states. States can enact whatever driver licensing provisions and
traffic codes they choose, and use their police powers to enforce them.
All 50 states have done so.

SCOTUS has also ruled

qt-tooltip="justia.com"}]{.qlink_container} that registering vehicles
and licensing drivers falls under the state's power to create laws and
police them, which falls under the state's compelling interest to create
a safe environment for its citizens.

Therefore, states are free to create traffic laws and to regulate
drivers, and doing so has been declared to be Constitutional on numerous
occasions.

So, to answer your question: **you have to have a driver's license
because all 50 states have laws requiring the operator of a motor
vehicle to be licensed in at least one state.**
