There are several reasons why there is controversy, but the primary
reason why embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are controversial is that **in
order to harvest any type of embryonic stem cell, it is necessarily
destructive to a fetus.**

There are two places from which you can harvest embryonic cells:

- Embryos. Embryonic **stem** cells are obtained from the inner cell
  mass of the early embryo, usually from 5 to 7 days old. Deriving these
  cells requires the destruction of the young embryo.
- Fetuses. Embryonic **germ** cells, another type of embryonic cell, are
  obtained from aborted fetuses several weeks old; though similar to
  embryonic stem cells, they have not been used much by researchers.

In contrast, **adult stem cells** (ASCs) can be harvested from the
following places: the blood of umbilical cords and the solid cord
tissue, the amniotic fluid that surrounds the baby in the womb, and the
placenta. It can also be derived from body tissues, or even cadavers.

Regardless of the advantages and disadvantages of each type of cell
(which is not what was asked), the major ethics controversy surrounding
these types of cells is the fact that in order to acquire embryonic stem
cells, you must destroy a fetus.
