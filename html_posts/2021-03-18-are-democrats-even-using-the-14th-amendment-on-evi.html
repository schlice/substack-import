**Are Democrats even using the 14th Amendment on evil Trump or not?**

The Constitution is not a bludgeon to be "used" on someone. The
Constitution is directions to government, not a tool for punishment.

The Constitution limits what government can do, and reminds government
what it cannot do.

If you want a bludgeon to use against someone, look to the law. When
someone is convicted of a crime, the law addresses punishment.

Therefore, ***after*** a person is convicted of a crime, we can talk
about punishment. But the Constitution is never to be used as a
punishment to anyone. It is a set of guardralis to keep government in
check.
