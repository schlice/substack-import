Hawaii has some reasonably tough gun laws. Here are some of the
highlights:

- Residents of Hawaii must get a permit for ***each individual firearm
  acquisition***. You must apply to the county chief of police before
  every firearm transaction and receive a permit before you can purchase
  or otherwise acquire a firearm. You must have training and
  qualifications which compare with what most other states have for
  concealed carry.
- Every legally-owned firearm in Hawaii must be registered.
- Safe storage requirements are in place. Every firearm must be safely
  stored when not in use.
- Hawaii is a "may issue" state for concealed carry.
- There is no open carry in the state.
- Magazines have a 10-round limit.
- Hawaii does have a Castle Doctrine and stand-your-ground laws.
