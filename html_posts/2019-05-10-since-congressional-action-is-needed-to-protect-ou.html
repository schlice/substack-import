**Since Congressional action is needed to protect our election
integrity, isn't the President's full cooperation needed to do so? Isn't
then his feuding with them, in itself, Obstruction?**

Let's start with your first claim: **Congressional action is needed to
protect our election integrity.**

Do you have any evidence to support this claim? Also, elections take
place at the state level, not the national level. It is incumbent upon
the states to secure their own elections, and to ensure the integrity of
the same. I am not entirely certain that Congressional action is needed.
Additionally, since states are unique (which is why the state is the
best government to enable a system of election), I also can't see what
national-level action can be implemented that wouldn't violate the
Constitution. The 10th Amendment says essentially that if the
Constitution doesn't allow the federal government to do something, that
something belongs to the states and to the people, respectively, to do.
This means that since the Constitution doesn't call for the Federal
government controlling elections across the states, then elections are a
state responsibility. So not only does it seem improper for the federal
government to step in, it also seems unconstitutionally broad for them
to do so as well.

Now the second claim (and your first question): **Isn't the President's
full cooperation needed to do so?**

Is the President's cooperation needed to pass a law? Yes, it is. If the
President disagrees with a law, he vetoes it. This is an indication that
he does not agree with the law becoming a law, and Constitutionally,
this is part of the process. The President is authorized to disagree
with Congress about the implementation of a law. Therefore, in order to
*pass* a law, the President's full cooperation is needed. In order to
*block* the passage of a law, the President must disagree with Congress.

Which should lead us to the answer to your second question: **Isn't then
his feuding with them, in itself, Obstruction?**

No, it is not. It is the normal functioning of government. The President
would disagree with Congress naturally, but the President disagreeing
with Congress does not prevent Congress from passing a bill on to the
President's desk for signature. No amount of "feuding" actually
obstructs Congress' ability to do their job and get a bill to the
President's desk for signature. Whether or not he disagrees is not
relevant. He can "feud" with Congress all he likes; this does not
prevent Congress from doing its job.
