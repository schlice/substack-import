An interesting question.

The Machiavellian quip of "the end justifies the means" implies that
"the end" is a moral good, but "the means" is not. Therefore, according
to Machiavelli, because "the end" is good, "the means" to achieve the
good end *become* good, whatever they are.

Sin does not work this way. Even if the end is good, sin is never
justified. The person who steals bread to feed his family is still
stealing, and it is still sinful.

But because this question is being asked, then "the flood" and "Jesus'
crucifixion" must obviously *appear* sinful. So we'll have to review
both of them to determine if they were.

First, while God is omnipotent, there are a few things that God cannot
do. For example, God cannot violate His own nature. Since sin is
"missing the mark," and the mark is God, God cannot sin. So if God does
something or ordains something, it is *de facto* not sinful.

Therefore, since God caused the Flood and He ordained Jesus' death and
resurrection, those things must not be sinful.

Therefore, the question becomes, "How are the flood and the crucifixion
not sinful?"

Let's begin with The Flood. It does have the appearance of being sinful.
So many "innocent" people were killed in the Flood, right? Didn't they
deserve to not die?

First, nowhere in the Bible does it say that the people who died in the
Flood were "innocent." Everyone is a sinner. Everyone deserves death
when compared to God's goodness. God is completely within His rights to
destroy each and every one of us. It is only His grace which prevents
Him from doing so.

Second, God already judged the whole world and found it lacking:

> *The LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and
> that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil
> continually. \-- Genesis 6:5 ESV*

Therefore, killing everyone was justified because God already judged
them.

Now let's look at the crucifixion. Certainly, Jesus was sinless. He was
not judged by God as being evil; He did not deserve death. How could His
crucifixion be anything but sinful?

Jesus' death was a **sacrifice**. A sacrifice is specifically an
offering made to a deity. In this case, Jesus Himself was the sacrifice.
He offered Himself ***because*** He was sinless. He offered to take on
the sin of the world in order to be a propitiation for us.

Perhaps if Jesus was unwilling, His death would have been sinful. But in
this case, Jesus Himself was offered as a sacrifice for our sins, and
God saw it as good.
