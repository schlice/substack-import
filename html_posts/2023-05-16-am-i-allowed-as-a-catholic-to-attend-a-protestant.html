My apologies, but to everyone who says you can't share in the communion
meal at a Protestant mass, they are indeed highly mistaken. This may
differ for some Protestant denominations, but for the vast majority of
us, it is simply not true.

One of the major differences between Catholicism and Protestantism is
the idea that Protestants believe that the Last Supper was *symbolic*.
It was a parable, just like Jesus had been teaching throughout His
entire earthly ministry. The bread is not Jesus' *actual* body. The wine
is not Jesus' *actual* blood. When Jesus did this, He was creating a new
tradition: **every time you eat this bread together, remember my body,
broken for you. Every time you drink this cup together, remember my
blood, poured out for you.**

So as a baptized believer in Christ, you are welcome to share the "meal"
with us (such that it is --- we either get those little "Jesus
Chicklets" of bread and the little cup of grape juice, or we get the two
conveniently pre-packaged in one little dual-lidded cup)

*(Same thing, but in one pre-loaded dual-lid cup)*

Even the "meal" is symbolic. It's not really much of a "meal," is it.

We do ask that only believers partake in communion. A believer is
someone who believes that Christ is indeed their Lord and Savior. It is
a special time for us, a time consecrated by Jesus for us to *commune*
with Him and with each other, so it is reserved for Christ-followers.

But as I have said before, even practicing Catholics can be believers
(and most are). So please, come, listen to the message. Share fellowship
with us. Sing to God. You don't even have to sing well. And make sure
you say hi. I love to meet new people in church.

That said, the inverse is not true. A Protestant cannot receive Holy
Communion at a Catholic Mass. You must be a practicing Catholic who has
received the Sacrament of Communion before you may receive the elements
at a Mass.
