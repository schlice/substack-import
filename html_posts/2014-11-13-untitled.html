<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [A very tongue-in-cheek answer to be sure, as most of the
\"fact-based\" arguments are wrong. I am American, I love the UK, and I
find most of these self-serving and in some cases wrong. For example
(and I won\'t go into a huge debate, but just pointing out an incorrect
answer):\
\
11. They have free universal healthcare, the best in the world, while we
remain the only developed country that doesn\'t.\
\
Let\'s break this down:\
Free: Nothing in this world is free. Someone pays for it. British
citizens pay for this through outrageously high taxes. Calling it
\"free\" is a misnomer. You simply don\'t pay for it at the point of
sale. You pay for it through your taxes.\
\
Universal: The only statement in this bullet that is close to being
correct. Anyone gets health care regardless of who you are. I mean, if
I\'m in Britain on holiday, I get exactly the same healthcare as a
British subject. Right? Don\'t I? I don\'t have to pay either, right?
Ah, so maybe it\'s not so \"universal\" and maybe you have to be a
British subject before you can get that \"universal\" healthcare.\
\
The best in the world: Clearly a subjective statement stuck into a
supposed statement of fact. Show me WHO statistics that show that
British citizens are better cared for than any other citizen in any
other country and I\'ll re-think this statement. Until then, it\'s your
personal opinion.\
\
While we remain the only developed country that doesn\'t: Depends on
your definition of developed. Many African countries could be considered
\"developed\" and they also do not have nationalized single-payer
healthcare.\
\
I don\'t doubt the greatness of the UK. But trying to justify it with
silliness like this just tweaks me.]{.rendered_qtext}
