<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [A very tongue-in-cheek answer to be sure, as most of the<br>\"fact-based\" arguments are wrong. I am American, I love the UK, and I<br>find most of these self-serving and in some cases wrong. For example<br>(and I won\'t go into a huge debate, but just pointing out an incorrect<br>answer):\<br>\<br>11. They have free universal healthcare, the best in the world, while we<br>remain the only developed country that doesn\'t.\<br>\<br>Let\'s break this down:\<br>Free: Nothing in this world is free. Someone pays for it. British<br>citizens pay for this through outrageously high taxes. Calling it<br>\"free\" is a misnomer. You simply don\'t pay for it at the point of<br>sale. You pay for it through your taxes.\<br>\<br>Universal: The only statement in this bullet that is close to being<br>correct. Anyone gets health care regardless of who you are. I mean, if<br>I\'m in Britain on holiday, I get exactly the same healthcare as a<br>British subject. Right? Don\'t I? I don\'t have to pay either, right?<br>Ah, so maybe it\'s not so \"universal\" and maybe you have to be a<br>British subject before you can get that \"universal\" healthcare.\<br>\<br>The best in the world: Clearly a subjective statement stuck into a<br>supposed statement of fact. Show me WHO statistics that show that<br>British citizens are better cared for than any other citizen in any<br>other country and I\'ll re-think this statement. Until then, it\'s your<br>personal opinion.\<br>\<br>While we remain the only developed country that doesn\'t: Depends on<br>your definition of developed. Many African countries could be considered<br>\"developed\" and they also do not have nationalized single-payer<br>healthcare.\<br>\<br>I don\'t doubt the greatness of the UK. But trying to justify it with<br>silliness like this just tweaks me.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-do-the-British-do-better-than-the-Americans/answer/Ivy-Lee-44<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
