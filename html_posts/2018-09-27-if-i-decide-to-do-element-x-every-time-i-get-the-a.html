**If I decide to do element X every time I get the addictive urge for
element Y, will my addiction eventually shift to X?**

Replacement addictions are a common method to beat addiction.

I am a former smoker. I always used to keep a pack of cigarettes in the
door pocket of my car, and I smoked in the car as a habit of getting
into the car and starting driving. I'd buckle my seat belt, put the car
in gear, start driving, and reach for the door pocket.

So I used a replacement addiction. I now keep a pack of **gum** in the
door pocket. I buckle my seat belt, put the car in gear, start driving,
and reach for the door pocket. Except now I grab a piece of gum instead
of a cigarette.

I now get antsy when I drive a car and there's no gum in the door
pocket.
