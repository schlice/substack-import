**Are there specialty lawyers in Colorado that can look for loopholes if
a tenant is taking advantage of you?**

You don't need specialty lawyers. Any real estate attorney who
specializes in landlord/tenant law can help you look over your contract
and find a clause you can use to evict your tenant if you need to do so.
