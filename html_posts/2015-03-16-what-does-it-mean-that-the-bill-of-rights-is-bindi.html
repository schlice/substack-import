**Content:** [The Bill of Rights, over the course of the years since its
inception, but most notably in Supreme Court decisions in the 60s and
70s, is binding on the states.\
\
This does not mean that \"individual\" rights are bound on \"states,\"
but they are binding in such a way that states cannot make laws that
abridge peoples\' rights as listed in the Bill of Rights, so state laws
are \"bound\" by the Bill of Rights. Justice Black wrote in *Duncan v
Louisiana*: \"No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge
the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.\" This
essentially means that the Bill of Rights applies to states and their
laws just as much as it applies to the Federal government.\
\
This is a view that was never expressly stated by the founders, as they
were more worried about restricting the growth of the federal government
than overreach by the states. However, numerous decisions by the Supreme
Court over the years has made it clear that the Bill of Rights binds
state governments.]{.rendered_qtext}
