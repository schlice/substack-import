Rather than start with the law, I'd like to first talk about the
technology.

The technology in question is called RFID - Radio Frequency ID. The way
it works is pretty simple:

1.  A fixed transceiver sends out an electromagnetic signal.
2.  A receiver in an RFID chip will receive that electromagnetic signal
    in a coil of wire, which induces an electrical current in that wire.
3.  The current powers a tiny transmitter, which sends a code.
4.  The transceiver receives the code.

The problem here is that RFID, as you can see, works in a very short
range. There are solutions which can work over longer distances, but
they are proprietary. Disney uses an RFID chip in their MagicBands, but
they also include a second radio, with an antenna that extends all the
way into the colored portion of the band, a 2.4 GHz transmitter, and a
button-cell battery to power the transmitter. They use XBR receivers
located throughout the park to receive the signals from these
MagicBands. There are two verified uses of the long-range XBR technology
at Disney so far:

- On certain rides, "ride videos" are created and are attached to the
  NextGen accounts of everyone on the ride, as determined by XBR
  receivers within the ride area.
- Lost Child operations are now greatly simplified if the child is
  wearing a MagicBand: park personnel can locate any MagicBand within
  the park and greatly narrow the search for a lost child.

Please note that this is all proprietary technology: there is no
long-range RFID equivalent. RFID itself only works at short distances.
So while the technology is out there, it is unrelated to an implantable
RFID chip. Perhaps at sometime in the future, we will be able to track a
low-power location chip embedded in a person anywhere in the world. But
with current technology, we can only track people within a confined
space, such as a building, using RFID.

Now, to the law.

1.  If you are a minor, your parents have legal responsibility for you.
    They are legally allowed to authorize medical procedures on your
    behalf, including implants.
2.  In order to successfully sue, you would have to show some harm from
    what they have done. If the implant has caused some demonstrable
    harm, your suit might have some legs.

**TL;DR:** One, RFID can't track you outside of a few feet, yet. Two,
you were presumably a minor when you were implanted, so it was legal for
them to do it. Three, you would have to show some harm if you expect
your lawsuit to be successful.
