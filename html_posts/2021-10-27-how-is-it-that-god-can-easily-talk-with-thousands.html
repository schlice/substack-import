Why would God bother trying to talk to people who aren't listening?

But even if he does, these people committing crimes are deliberately
choosing to ignore God. In actuality, God is probably speaking to them.
You know, that little voice inside your head which tells you that what
you're about to do is wrong. But clearly, they don't want to hear it,
because they have their heart set on committing a crime.

It doesn't matter how much God tries to talk to them **if they're not
listening.**
