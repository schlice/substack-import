If it is disclosed beforehand that a requirement for entry is a police
review of driving record and a NCIC check for wants and warrants, then
yes it is perfectly legal.

I dispute whether or not it is actually done in practice. NCIC isn\'t a
system which can be checked willy-nilly. Police are held to strict
accountability for every records check they perform, and performing
records checks for entry into a gated community, with no reasonable
suspicion, let alone probable cause, sounds a bit improbable to me.
