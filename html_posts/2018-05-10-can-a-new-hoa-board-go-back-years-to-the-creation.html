**Can a new HOA board go back years to the creation of the subdivision
and make homeowners file for approval for any improvements done to their
homes that the current board does not have paperwork on file for?**

In most states, an HOA cannot do this.

In most covenants, and in most states, the HOA has one year following a
homeowner making a change to the exterior of the home to begin the
process requesting that the homeowner modify or remove it. It's sorta
like a statute of limitations for HOAs. If the HOA has not formally
requested, in writing, that the homeowner fix something which is not in
keeping with the Governing Documents, within one year, it becomes
permanent.

You will need to check your state and local laws to see if you have such
a provision. If your HOA is making you re-file for changes made years
ago, it might be time to consult with a real estate attorney in your
area who specializes in HOA law.
