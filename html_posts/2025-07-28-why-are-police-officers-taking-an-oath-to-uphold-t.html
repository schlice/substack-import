Why do you sign an official government form accepting a driver's license
saying that you will obey the traffic laws but them you speed anyway?

By accepting a driver's license, and by driving a vehicle on public
roads, you are generally considered to have *implicitly consented* to
abide by the traffic laws and regulations of that jurisdiction. Yet we
know that people break the traffic laws all the time.

Why does anyone say they are going to do one thing and then do another?
