The short answer is that if you don't make any income, you may not need
to pay any taxes, but the IRS may still require you to file.

That said, even if you don't make any money, there may be some benefits
to filing. But you really won't find out if you need to file until you
enter all of your information into TurboTax first:

> When you\'re a sole proprietor, you report your business revenue and
> expenses on Schedule C. After you calculate your net business income,
> write it on your Form 1040, along with any other income you made. That
> includes investments, your day job and your spouse\'s day job if you
> file jointly. Your tax is based on the total of all that income, plus
> self-employment, minus your deductions.
>
> Even if your business made no money, your total income may require you
> to write a check to the IRS.[\[1\]](#rhZTp){#cite-rhZTp

Additionally, there could be some benefits to filing even if you didn't
make any money. If you are eligible for a tax refund, or if you are
eligible for business tax credits, the only way to get those is to file.
Also, you can write off your business loss against business gains in
future years, but you won't be able to do any of that if you don't file.

If you have questions, speak to a tax professional. TurboTax has options
for you to engage with tax professionals from within the program.
