**Content:** [Whether or not Officer Wilson was \"wrongfully\" acquitted
is a matter of opinion. The full, and only, story is that a grand jury,
in an abnormally-extended timeframe, very carefully considered the
testimony of over 60 people involved with the case, as well as forensic
evidence, and found that there was not enough evidence to indict him on
murder charges. This is, technically, not a \"wrongful\" acquittal,
since a grand jury, presumably doing its job to the best of its
abilities, made a judgment. So to say that it was a \"wrongful\"
acquittal is a matter of opinion, not of fact.\
\
This isn\'t to say that he didn\'t act in accordance with department
policy or that he, perhaps, should have done something differently. That
determination is up to the department, and they\'re not saying what they
found, as they are under no obligation to release the results of any
internal review into the incident. At this point, it makes no difference
since Officer Wilson resigned from the department. What he did, and/or
what he should have done, is now a matter best suited to in-service
training for other officers.]{.rendered_qtext}
