Under the National Emergencies Act, the President can use certain
emergency powers which have been written into Federal law at a time of
war or declared national emergency. Basically, when Congress writes a
law, they add a section that the President can activate in time of war
or national emergency.

The President is required to promptly notify Congress of the national
emergency, and notify them of the section of Federal law enacted via
national emergency.

Congress has the authority under the same law to pass a joint resolution
to terminate a national emergency. The President can veto the
resolution, and then Congress would need a 2/3 majority in both houses
to override the veto.

However, any funds obligated during the national emergency would remain
obligated after the national emergency ends.
