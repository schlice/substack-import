**What are the chances of an independent candidate like Ross Perot in
2020 not necessarily winning but getting some electoral college votes
and changing the political landscape?**

Independents like Perot don't necessarily gain Electoral College votes.
You'd need to win a state in order to do that.

But independents do change the political landscape by pulling votes away
from Republican or Democrat nominees. The independent candidate doesn't
just get the independent vote; he will often take votes away from a
primary party candidate, clearing the way for the opposition to win.
