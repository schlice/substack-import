Quick US government lesson here: *Trump doesn't pass a tax bill.*

Trump has spent a lot of time advocating for tax cuts, but it's not
Trump's bill. It's the Republicans in Congress who passed (separate
versions of) a tax bill.

The bill still needs to go to committee and be resolved, and then they
need to vote on it again before it goes to Trump for signature.
