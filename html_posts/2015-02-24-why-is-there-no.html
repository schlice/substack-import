**Content:** [It\'s important to remember that the people who first came
to America came ***from England***, so these former English citizens had
a \"dream\" of something \"better.\"\
\
They dreamed of a place where:\
]{.rendered_qtext}

- they could freely practice their religion
- there was no taxation without representation
- you could speak out against the government without fear of reprisal
- there was no king

\
The original \"American Dream\" was to have a self-determined life
without being a pawn of the king; it was freedom to live your life on
your own terms, to make your own way.\
\
This eventually morphed into the \"dream\" of making it big in America
because everyone had *equal opportunity* under the new American
government*.* This is an important piece of history that, sometimes, it
seems our current administration forgets. Equality in America means
equality of **[opportunity]{.underline}**, not equality of
**[outcome]{.underline}**. It\'s the \"rags to riches\" story: everyone
has the same opportunity to make it big. Freedom and equality means we
all get the same opportunity to succeed or fail, and if that opportunity
is not there, the government should be stepping in and leveling the
playing field. The government should not be taking from one class and
giving to another because it\'s not \"fair.\" Equality of outcome was
never part of the American Experiment; equality of opportunity was the
driving factor.\
\
(NOTE: That\'s not to say we don\'t care about the poor; Americans are
exceedingly generous and give freely of their time and resources
whenever possible; but the American people grow weary of generations of
professional moochers who do little more than create new generations of
professional moochers.)
