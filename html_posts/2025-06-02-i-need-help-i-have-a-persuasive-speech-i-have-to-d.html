ChatGPT! Use the tools you already have!

**WARNING: DO NOT USE THIS AS YOUR SPEECH! Use this as a template.**

I asked ChatGPT the following:

***Please help me write a persuasive speech about human cloning which
states that the practice is unethical. Include expanded discussion about
individual ethical issues.***

And here's what it gave me:

\

Ladies and gentlemen,

Imagine a world where science replicates human beings---where genetic
duplicates are engineered in laboratories. What was once confined to the
pages of science fiction is inching closer to reality. Yet, just because
something is scientifically feasible does not mean it is ethically
permissible. Human cloning is not merely a technological
advancement---it is a profound ethical challenge that threatens human
dignity, autonomy, and social stability. Today, I will argue that human
cloning is unethical, dangerous, and must be opposed.

Human beings are unique, not just because of their DNA, but because of
their experiences, relationships, and choices. Cloning undermines this
individuality by creating a genetic replica of an existing person. Would
a cloned individual ever be seen as their own person, or merely as a
copy? The psychological burden of being a clone---constantly compared to
the original---raises serious concerns about identity and self-worth.
Human life should not be defined solely by genetic material but by the
ability to carve out one\'s own identity.

One of the most fundamental ethical principles is the right to
self-determination. Yet, clones would be created without their own
consent. They would be brought into existence not as a result of natural
birth but as products of scientific manipulation. This raises the
question: Do clones have the same rights as naturally born humans, or
would they be treated as secondary citizens? The inability to consent to
one's own existence sets a dangerous precedent that erodes basic human
rights.

Cloning is far from a perfected science. Animal cloning has resulted in
high rates of deformities, premature aging, and painful medical
conditions. If human cloning were to proceed, it is inevitable that
cloned individuals would suffer similar consequences. The process of
cloning could lead to unpredictable mutations, high infant mortality
rates, and severe physical suffering. Should we allow human beings to be
subjected to such risks simply for scientific curiosity? Prioritizing
research over well-being is a reckless violation of ethical
responsibility.

Human cloning creates alarming possibilities for exploitation. Imagine
governments or corporations using cloning technology to manufacture
soldiers, workers, or even human subjects for experimentation. The
commodification of human life---where individuals are engineered for
specific purposes---turns people into products rather than autonomous
beings. This would lead to severe ethical abuses, allowing powerful
entities to exert control over human reproduction.

If cloning were normalized, what would prevent society from selectively
engineering \"perfect\" individuals? Would we start cloning only those
with high intelligence, physical strength, or specific attributes deemed
desirable? The pursuit of genetically superior humans is dangerously
reminiscent of past eugenics movements that sought to control human
genetics to create an idealized population. Such practices threaten the
natural diversity of humanity and promote harmful social hierarchies.

Human cloning also creates complex legal challenges. Would a clone be
granted the same legal status as naturally conceived individuals? Would
they have the same inheritance rights, citizenship status, and
protections under the law? Without clear regulations, cloned individuals
could be denied basic freedoms, leading to discrimination and social
alienation. The law must be prepared to address these uncertainties
before cloning technology is ever considered.

Human cloning is more than just a scientific question---it is a moral
dilemma with far-reaching consequences. It threatens individuality,
violates consent, poses health risks, invites exploitation, and opens
the door to dangerous genetic engineering practices. Society must
recognize that human dignity cannot be compromised in the pursuit of
scientific ambition. We have a responsibility to ensure that
technological progress does not come at the expense of ethical
integrity.

For these reasons, we must stand against human cloning. Science should
be used to uplift humanity, not to manufacture life in ways that strip
individuals of their autonomy and dignity.

Thank you.

This is a really good start at a persuasive speech regarding how human
cloning is unethical.

But it is not perfect.

For example, ChatGPT noted that clones did not consent to their
creation. But neither do naturally-born humans. I believe the difference
is that parents normally consent to the creation of children, but
generally, scientists create clones without two consenting adults
signing up to become their parents. Clones exist without family. I think
that's what ChatGPT was going for, but it sort of failed in that task. I
would absolutely re-write that paragraph. But the rest is really good.
