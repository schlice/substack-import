**If someone stronger than attacking me and beating me can I stab them
as a self defense or should I just take the beating?**

The answer to this is more than a simple yes or no.

Let's keep our answer focused on the United States.

In general, if you are in fear for your life, you can use any amount of
force, up to and including lethal force, to defend your life. So in the
United States, if you are in fear for your life, and you can articulate
that fear, your actions can be justified as self defense. Remember that
this is an *affirmative defense,* which means you admit that you stabbed
your attacker, but you did so only to defend your own life or to defend
yourself from grievous bodily harm.

If you can articulate the honestly-held belief that you were in fear for
your life, you may likely have a defense against the assault charge
which will be leveled against you. But remember you will have to defend
your actions in court.

(EDIT) I also recognize that a small handful of states don't universally
give you the right to defend yourself without first trying to escape.
These are called "duty to retreat" states. However, most states have
what's called a "Stand Your Ground" clause in their self-defense law.
States began expanding their self-defense laws in the 1980s, when a
handful of states added clauses stating that citizens have a right to
feel secure inside their homes, and can use whatever force necessary, up
to and including deadly force, to defend themselves against intruders
into their homes. These are commonly referred to as "castle doctrine
laws," referring to the phrase "a man's home is his castle."

In 2005, Florida expanded further, creating what is now commonly
referred to as "Stand Your Ground" laws, essentially expanding their
castle doctrine laws to "any place you are legally allowed to be."
Florida's law states "a person who is not engaged in an unlawful
activity and who is attacked in any other place where he or she has a
right to be has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her
ground and meet force with force, including deadly force, if he or she
reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great
bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the
commission of a forcible felony." Other states quickly followed suit,
and at least 25 states have Stand your Ground clauses in their
self-defense laws.
