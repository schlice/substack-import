The problem here is that mandating something, *either way* (either
mandating that all customers in all state businesses be vaccinated,
**OR** mandating that no businesses can use vaccination status as a
means of discrimination of patrons), infringes on the rights of
businesses to decide whether or not they choose to allow only vaccinated
people to patronize their stores. If the state *didn't* push back on the
Federal government, they would have come in and demanded vaccination for
everyone.

Florida has decided, as a state government, that they do not want
vaccination status to be a discriminating factor anywhere in the state.
For one, it's unfair to people who had COVID and recovered (who also
have immunity). I won't go into all of Florida's justifications for
their law. Suffice it to say that to accomplish this, they banned any
business from asking for vaccination passports, or from using
vaccination status to discriminate against patrons.

If a business wants to protect itself, they can buy COVID tests for
everyone who walks in the door. Rapid tests do exist, they can provide
results in 15--30 minutes. They can also enforce social distancing and
mask wearing in the store. The CDC says these measures work, so
businesses can do this if they choose.

Original question:

The national Review reports that Florida businesses that require proof
of vaccination can be fined up to 5,000 dollars. Why can't customers go
to restaurants or stores that don't require vaccinations and honor the
ones who do?
