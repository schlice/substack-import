**Should a person living outside California be worried when they see a
label stating that the State of California has determined that the item
contains a substantial amount of a substance which has been linked to
cancer?**

You mis-stated what the label says.

The label says that the item contains a substance known to cause cancer.
Not a "substantial amount." Not even an amount that can harm you. Just
an amount.

I had a Crock-Pot once, and on the bottom, this label was there. After
investigating, I found that the solder used to hold the light bulb which
illuminated when the Crock-Pot was powered on contained lead. This
solder has absolutely zero to do with cooking my food. It was
permanently sealed inside the base of the unit, "no user-serviceable
parts inside," the other label read. It never came into contact with
anything meaningful.

However, the product contained lead, somewhere.

Literally, the most un-helpful label ever to be found on anything I've
used.

Most people, for that reason, simply ignore these labels.
