I still have one amalgam filling left, placed in my tooth while I was in
high school. My neurologist hasn't recommended to me that I remove it
yet, and my dentist has been removing them through attrition: when an
amalgam filling fails or breaks, we replace it, but if it is stable
inside the tooth, we're leaving it.

So the prevailing guidance is to use non-amalgam fillings if you have a
pre-existing neurological condition, and if you are diagnosed after you
get amalgam fillings, the prevailing guidance in the United States is to
not use them for new fillings, but it isn't 100% necessary to remove
them all right away.

Original question:

The FDA recommends that non-amalgam be used for people with a
preexisting neurological condition such as multiple sclerosis, but what
about before that condition is diagnosed?
