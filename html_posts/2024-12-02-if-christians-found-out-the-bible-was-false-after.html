One author cannot speak for all the authors who wrote their inspired
works over thousands of years. There are still 39 other authors who
wrote inspired works, and there are corroborated miracles which actually
occurred which will still have to be explained. And remember, these
miracles were penned thousands of years before they took place. And the
math has been done---the probability of these miracles coming true
randomly in the life of one man is so astronomically high that it is
*functionally* impossible.

So one book by one author being found to be fraudulent isn't enough to
indict the entire Bible, which was written by 40 different authors over
three continents in three languages over the course of about 1500 years.
One scroll detailing that one book was a lie out of all 66 books of the
Bible won't really move the needle.

And let's go even further; let's pose the hypothetical. *Even if the
entire Bible was found to be fraudulent* (which is not possible given
the constraints of the question), **where have you put your faith?** Did
you put your faith in **a living God** who has actually done work in
your life, or have you put your faith in a **book**?

Finally, there are sources outside the Bible which also detail the life
of Christ. In all, there are ten non-Christian sources which are not
part of the Bible which also described the life of Christ. They are:
Flavius Josephus, a Jewish historian; Tacitus, the Roman historian;
Pliny the Younger, a Roman politician; Phlegon, a freed slave who wrote
histories; Thallus, a first-century historian; Seutonius, a Roman
historian; Lucian, a Greek satirist; Celsus, a Roman philosopher; Mara
Bar-Serapion, a private citizen who wrote to his son; and the Jewish
Talmud.

Together, these ten non-Christian sources (again, without the Bible),
reveal the following:

1.  Jesus lived during time of Tiberius Caesar.
2.  He lived a virtuous life.
3.  He was a wonder-worker.
4.  He had a brother named James.
5.  He was acclaimed to be the Messiah.
6.  He was crucified under Pontius Pilate.
7.  He was crucified on the eve of the Jewish Passover.
8.  Darkness and an earthquake occurred when he died.
9.  His disciples believed he rose from the dead.
10. His disciples were willing to die for their belief.
11. Christianity spread rapidly as far as Rome.
12. His disciples denied the Roman gods and worshiped Jesus as God.

So *if you had just these non-Christian sources, and your faith was in
God and not in a book,* ***would you still believe?***

Most Christians would still believe, even without the Bible, because the
faith is in **Christ,** not in a book.
