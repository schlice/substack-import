Lawsuits generally cause friendly communications to cease.

That's right, I would sue them for slander. Slander is a false statement
which defames another person. I would have to prove the harm to the
court, but if it ruined my reputation, I would easily be able to prove
it.

Slander is one form of **defamation.** As the defamed party, I could
seek damages for any lost earnings, future lost earning capacity, and
other lost business or economic opportunities that I suffered or that I
would be likely to suffer as a result of the defamatory statement.

TL;DR: False statements against me are grounds to lose a friend. False
statements **which ruin reputations** are grounds for a lawsuit.

Original question:

If a parent falsely accused you of stealing and ruined your reputation,
would you cease all communication with them?
