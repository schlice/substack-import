**Mostly incorrect.**

**Atheism is absolutely a worldview and a belief system, and depending
on how you define it, it could be a religion.**

Atheism is absolutely a worldview, as it answers the main questions
posed by all worldviews: our *origin, identity, meaning, the source of
our morality,* and our *destiny*. There are three main worldviews which
exist in this world: **theism**, **pantheism** and **atheism**. Theism
believes that God created all, Pantheism believes that God *is* all, and
atheism believes that there is "no god at all." So it is indeed a
worldview.

Atheism is also definitely a belief system. Atheists have *exactly as
much evidence that God does not exist as theists have that God does
exist.* Therefore, both believe (through faith) in their positions. If
you define "theism" as "belief in the existence of a god," atheism is
"belief in the non-existence of a god." And here's where atheists get
confused. They have just as much belief and faith as theists do, they
simply **believe** (through faith) that a god does not exist. That makes
atheism absolutely a belief system.

Whether or not atheism is a *religion* wholly depends on your definition
of religion. Usually, when atheists say that atheism is not a religion,
they mean it's not an "organized" religion with belief in a god or gods,
like those that meet in church buildings and praise their creator(s) and
do community service and all the other things that religious groups do.
Atheism is definitely not that. But if you define religion as a belief
system which believes in things based on faith (which is indeed one of
the definitions of *religion*), then atheism could be defined as a
religion.
