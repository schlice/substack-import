An excellent question!

We can partially glean the answer from what free will will look like in
the future kingdom that believers will inherit. Clearly, evil will be
defeated, and we will have no desire for sin. Therefore, in heaven, our
free will will be limited by the inability to choose what is evil. We
will only be able to choose that which is true, noble, right, pure,
lovely, and admirable (ref Phillipians 4:8).

Also, in order to answer the question you posit about free will, we have
to come to an understanding about what it is. In my opinion, free will
consists of three elements:

- agency over oneself
- at least two choices freely available to pick from
- control over our own actions

If you have these three, you have free will. God knowing which choice
you will make doesn't influence your decision in that moment. You still
have complete agency over your thoughts and control over your actions,
so you still have free will. God may know what you're going to do, but
you still have the freedom to choose in the moment. It's a function of
being creatures who are bound by time.

So now to answer the question. You said that if humans were created with
free will, then that must mean that we were meant to exist in a realm
with evil.

Knowing what we know now, we can see that this is not true. God created
Adam and Eve with free will (they chose to eat the apple), but without a
desire for sin, as sin did not enter the world until they made their
choice. Without the tempting of the serpent, Eve would not have been
coerced into eating the apple, because she had no *desire* for sin. It
was the serpent who planted the seeds of doubt and question into Eve's
mind. Before the serpent, Adam and Eve existed nearly exactly as we will
in heaven, *except that they had an extra choice, provided by the
serpent, a choice we will not have in heaven.*

So knowing this, we at least know that humans can function with full
free will *in an environment without evil.* And knowing this, you can
see that we were created with the *ability* to live in an environment
filled with sin, but without the actual sin. Our free will allows us to
function in that environment, even though it wasn't part of the original
design.

Original question:

If humans are created with free will, doesn\'t that suggest that we were
meant to exist in a realm between good and evil? Had we not the
knowledge of evil, what other could we choose from? (referring to the
forbidden fruit).
