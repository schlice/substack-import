Under current US law, you must be adjudicated by a judge as being
mentally incompetent or having a mental defect or deficiency before your
mental state will bar you from purchasing a weapon.

Just seeing a psychiatrist is not enough to flag you in NICS as a person
who is prevented from purchasing a weapon.

That bar was set high following deinstitutionalization.
