The 6th Commandment can be either You shall not Murder or You shall not
commit adultery, depending on your translation. It appears in various
translations in various positions.

And people don't listen to them due to the same reasoning that everyone
uses when they sin: people choose man's way over God's way. Man's way is
more fun. Having no accountability for your actions is definitely more
interesting than being told you can't do something.
