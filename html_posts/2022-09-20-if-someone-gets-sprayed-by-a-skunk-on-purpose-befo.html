Since you are talking about trying to find a way out of jury duty,
you'll only buy yourself a reprieve for that particular day, not a "get
out of jail free" card to get out of jury duty.

You'll be excused for the day and ordered to report on another day in
the court's calendar for that season. Continued attempts to get out of
jury duty will not be looked upon favorably.

And in all of your scheming to get out of jury duty, think about this:
if you are falsely accused of a crime and they were picking a jury for
your trial, would you want your potential jurors to have the same
contempt for the system as you do, and to try their hardest to get out
of serving on your jury? Even if they did get seated on the jury, would
they be the most impartial people available?

Perhaps you'd be better served by doing your civic duty (it's literally
once a year at most --- our jurisdiction used to call it the "one day,
one trial" system) and just serving as requested. One of the things that
makes the American legal system a good one is the fact that you are
tried by a jury of your peers. Someone has to be the *peer* when someone
else is on trial. You'd want a good peer to be there for you, so it only
follows that you should be the good peer for someone else.

If someone gets sprayed by a skunk (on purpose) before going to jury
duty, what would likely follow?
