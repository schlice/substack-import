When a home is sold, the proceeds are distributed to the people listed
on the deed according to their ownership percentage in the property,
meaning each person receives a share of the sale price based on their
portion of ownership as defined on the deed, unless there is a specific
agreement stating otherwise between the owners.

If multiple people are listed on the deed with \"joint tenancy,\" they
typically receive equal shares of the proceeds. If the deed specifies
\"tenancy in common,\" the owners can have different percentages of
ownership, and the proceeds are distributed accordingly.

The deed is the legal document that determines how ownership is divided,
so it\'s crucial to review it carefully to understand how proceeds will
be distributed.
