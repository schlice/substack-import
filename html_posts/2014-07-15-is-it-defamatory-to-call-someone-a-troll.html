<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Nope, not at all.\<br>\<br>What you are doing is attempting to describe someone\'s behavior, and<br>that view is entirely subjective. It is based on unwritten \"community<br>standards\" of conduct.\<br>\<br>To claim defamation, the \"troll\" would have to be able to show some<br>harm that the moniker had caused. Your defense would have to show<br>patterns of behavior that would make a reasonable person consider the<br>poster a \"troll.\"\<br>\<br>If you can show that a reasonable person would consider the poster a<br>troll, you are not fabricating a moniker. Basically, if it walks like a<br>duck and it quacks like a duck, and you call it a duck, you\'re fine. If<br>you call it a duck but it walks like a dog and barks like a dog, you may<br>have an issue.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
