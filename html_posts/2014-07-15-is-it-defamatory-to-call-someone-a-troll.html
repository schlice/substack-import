**Content:** [Nope, not at all.\
\
What you are doing is attempting to describe someone\'s behavior, and
that view is entirely subjective. It is based on unwritten \"community
standards\" of conduct.\
\
To claim defamation, the \"troll\" would have to be able to show some
harm that the moniker had caused. Your defense would have to show
patterns of behavior that would make a reasonable person consider the
poster a \"troll.\"\
\
If you can show that a reasonable person would consider the poster a
troll, you are not fabricating a moniker. Basically, if it walks like a
duck and it quacks like a duck, and you call it a duck, you\'re fine. If
you call it a duck but it walks like a dog and barks like a dog, you may
have an issue.]{.rendered_qtext}
