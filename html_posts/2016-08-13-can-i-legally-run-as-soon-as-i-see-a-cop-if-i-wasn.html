If it\'s legal to *walk* away from a police officer, it\'s legal to
*run* away from that officer. If you\'re not being detained (or even
spoken to), the law doesn\'t care what speed you move.

That all changes depending on whether or not the officer spoke to you
first.

I know in your example you said you ran the second you saw the police.
But if the police said, "Hey, I need to talk to you," and **then** you
ran, now we have a problem.

And if the police were looking for someone who matched your description,
if you start running, even if you are totally innocent, you just shined
a huge spotlight on yourself, basically saying, "Hey! Here I am!" Expect
lots of attention.
