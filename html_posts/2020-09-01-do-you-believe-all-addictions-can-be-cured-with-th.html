**Do you believe all addictions can be cured with the right relationship
with God?**

Can God cure addiction? Absolutely 100% yes. There is nothing that God
can\'t do. Nothing. Any question that begins with "Can God" is answered
with yes, God can.

But should we *expect* that God should do this? Should we expect that we
can induce God into action by us doing something? Should we expect God
to respond a certain way based on what we do?

There used to be a phrase I would use often: *God doesn't give you more
than you can handle*. The sentiment was accurate, but it put the focus
in the wrong place. It is better said: *You can handle anything when you
trust in God.* God is not doling out your trials and only allotting
exactly the amount you can handle on your own. God *expects* you to lean
on him.

> Trust in the Lord with all your heart\
> and lean not on your own understanding;\
> in all your ways submit to him,\
> and he will make your paths straight.
>
> ---Proverbs 3:5--6 NIV

Note what the psalmist says here: Trust in God, and **lean not on your
own understanding**. Isaiah 55:8--9 tells us why we often don't
understand what God is doing: \"\'For my thoughts are not your thoughts,
neither are your ways my ways,\' declares the Lord. \'For as the heavens
are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my
thoughts than your thoughts.\'\" God sees the whole picture, while we
only see our tiny corner of it. **To trust in the Lord with all our
heart means we can't place our own right to understand above His right
to direct our lives the way He sees fit.** When we insist on God always
making sense to our finite minds, we are setting ourselves up for
spiritual trouble.

Our limited understanding can easily lead us astray. Proverbs 16:25
says, \"There is a way that appears to be right, but in the end it leads
to death.\" **When we choose to direct our lives according to what seems
right to** ***us*, we often reap disaster** (Judges 21:25).

The point here is that while we might think that by setting ourselves
into a "right relationship" (as far as we know), that God should do
something. It's the "vending machine" view of God: I do something, and
God responds the way I choose.

Here's my question: ***what happens to you if you set yourself in a
right relationship with God and he doesn't cure your addiction?***

Were you simply not worthy? Did you not set your relationship right
enough? Did you do something to displease God? Or worse, does God even
care?

These are not only dangerous thoughts, but they border on the
blasphemous.

The bottom line is that *we may never know during our lifetime what
God's plans for us entail.* What we **do** know is that God keeps his
promises. And he has promised us that if we believe in Jesus and accept
him as our savior and turn our lives over to him, we will be saved.

Our lives may not proceed in exactly the way we thought. Indeed, our
lives may involve pain. But we have never been told that the life of a
believer would be free of struggle. Indeed, even the greats of the faith
in the Bible lived lives of torture until they died, and never got an
adequate explanation of how their lives would impact the world while
they were alive. But they never questioned that God was doing what he
promised. The pain of life never made them stop believing in God. Just
look at the life of Job for a perfect example of this.

Ultimately, God never promised us a life free of pain. He also never
promised that he would act a certain way if we act a certain way. He has
promised that if we believe in him and commit our lives to him, we will
be saved.

**TL;DR: Can God remove addiction? Yes. Should we** ***expect*** **God
to remove addiction, regardless of what we do? No.**
