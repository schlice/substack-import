**What are the laws that allow citizens to detain other citizens until
the police arrive?**

The laws you are referring to are known in most jurisdictions as a
"citizen's arrest."

Be very aware: the laws surrounding the ability to make a citizen's
arrest vary wildly from state to state. The ability to use force to
effect your arrest, the crimes for which a citizen can effect a
citizen's arrest, etc. Always check your local laws before doing
anything.

In general, a person can arrest someone they reasonably suspect of
committing a felony, even if they didn't see the felony being committed.
As long as a felony was actually committed and the arrestor knew of the
crime, reasonable suspicion that the person being arrested is the
suspect is all that is generally needed. Also, citizen's arrest does not
apply to "attempted" crimes; the crime must actually have occurred in
order to effect a citizen's arrest. Even if the arrestor reasonably
believes a crime occurred, if the crime did not actually occur, the
arrest is unlawful and opens the arrestor up to civil and criminal
liability. Citizen's arrest cannot be used, in general, for
misdemeanors. Also interesting about citizen's arrest: there are fewer
Constitutional restrictions than police have. For example, since the
citizen is not the government, the Fourth Amendment does not apply
(unless a law enforcement officer directed the citizen to make the
arrest, in which case the Fourth Amendment does apply). As for use of
force, citizens may only use the amount of force necessary to effect the
arrest. Exactly how much force that constitutes is a matter of law to be
determined by a jury.

Use of deadly force is really sketchy. Some states allow deadly force
only if life is threatened or grave bodily injury is threatened. Others
allow deadly force to stop a fleeing suspect, but the laws surrounding
use of deadly force are wildly varied among states.

Just as with law enforcement, if the arrest was found to be unlawful,
you're on the hook for that unlawful arrest, illegal detention, and
possibly kidnapping. If force was used, you'd be on the hook for assault
and battery.

Effecting a citizen's arrest is fraught with legal peril, and there is
no qualified immunity like law enforcement has. Your arrest has to be
good or you'll find yourself in legal peril very quickly.
