**What is the law saying that immigrants must be detained while waiting
for their hearing instead of some alternative?**

There are a few things at play here. One is the treatment of illegal
immigrants, and the other is the treatment of children who accompany
illegal immigrants across the border.

In this case, we're talking about Federal law which says that if you
enter the country illegally, it is a crime for which you are arrested.
When you are caught violating Federal law, you go to jail. It's kind of
a given; I'm not sure why this is a difficult concept to understand.

I'm not certain that there are many scenarios in which you can violate
Federal law, get caught, and have some alternative to jail. There could
be bond, I guess. But what bond agent is going to put up the bond for an
illegal immigrant? Maybe some would, I don't know. But perhaps you could
bond out of custody.

Minors can be released into the custody of an adult. Some minors cannot
be released, and they go into approved housing facilities.

More to the current controversy is the treatment of those minor children
who are not released. As to their treatment, there is no written law.
What you have is a series of INS procedures which were challenged in
court, and thus became "case law."

The specific case law pertains to a case colloquially called the
[[*Flores Consent Decree of
1997*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=eac750&url=https://www.conservativedailynews.com/2018/06/flores-consent-decree-of-1997-full-text/){.external_link

says that for minors who are not released, they must be "expeditiously"
moved to new facilities.
