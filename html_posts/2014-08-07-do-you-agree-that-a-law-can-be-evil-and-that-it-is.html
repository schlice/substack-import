**Content:** [This is a great question. Almost sounds like homework from
my Law 410 class \"The Ethics of Law\".\
\
Can a law be evil? If you hold to the opinion (as I do) that you cannot
legislate morality, then a law cannot be evil *prima facie.* It is only
morality that can determine \"goodness\" or \"evilness.\" If
implementing the law consistently causes you to violate your moral code,
I would consider peaceful protest and not follow that law.\
\
Morals are personal or cultural values, and so what is morally right in
one culture may not be morally right in another culture. For us to judge
another culture based on the standards of our own is what we call
*ethnocentrism* and in today\'s \"global village\" it\'s something we
need to guard against.\
\
Laws that violate internationally-recognized standards of human decency
should be strongly objected to in the international arena, and the
countries that implement such laws should be singled out. It\'s a good
job for the United Nations. I suggest they stay out of every other job
while they\'re at it.]{.rendered_qtext}
