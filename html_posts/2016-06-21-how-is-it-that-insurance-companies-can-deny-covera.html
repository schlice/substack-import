As sad as it is, I have to agree with [[Jenny
Hall](https://www.quora.com/profile/Jenny-Hall-3)]{.qlink_container} on
this one.

When you purchase prescription drug insurance (or your company does, on
your behalf), the insurance company publishes a "formulary" which
details what drugs they cover, and what drugs perform the same function
or similar function but at a higher price. Drugs listed on the formulary
are known as "preferred" drugs. Drugs not listed on the formulary are
known as "non-preferred" drugs.

Additionally, insurance companies charge different amounts for generic
drugs vs brand-name drugs, since brand-name drugs are more expensive.

Finally, most large pharmaceutical companies also have mail order
divisions, and will only cover a certain number of retail pharmacy
prescription fills. If you have medications for chronic diseases, they
will usually only cover a few retail fills before they will no longer
cover the medication (known as a "retail refill allotment"). The good
news is that you can usually get a 90-day supply through the mail, and
you'll pay less than three 30-day supplies at your local pharmacy.

My insurance company has six different pricing models, three for mail
order and three for retail fills. Our retail refill allotment is 3. For
each, we have a price for generics, preferred brand names, and
non-preferred brand names.

Not all insurance companies operate like this. Many will simply not pay
anything for non-preferred brand name medication. The bottom line is
that *when you purchase the insurance, you agree to these terms.* You
agree to let the drug company tell your doctor that he is not being
fiscally responsible and trying the generic alternatives to the brand
name drugs first, before jumping directly to the brand name drugs.

The problem is that insurance companies are staffed by doctors who truly
believe that generic drugs work exactly like their brand-name
counterparts. Unfortunately, we who are consumers of many different
pharmaceuticals (brand name and generic) know that this is not always
the case. That never stopped the drug insurance company from following
that guidance anyway.

As has been noted, you can appeal the decision. Your doctor has to prove
that the "approved" drugs that they recommend (generally, generic
versions of the brand-name drugs they denied) have already been tried
and have been found to be ineffective for your condition. The doctor
will have to provide the treatment records that show you tried the
generics and they didn't work.

If your doctor is willing to go to bat for you, you can file an appeal
and in some cases the insurance company will reverse its decision.

If they do not, sometimes the drug manufacturer itself has a discount
plan you can use. Check their website for more information.
Additionally, don't forget to contact your local chapter of the [[MS
Society](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=207640&url=http://www.nmss.org){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"

for you to use to get assistance with drugs and their cost if your
insurance company refuses to pay. You may have state assistance programs
you can tap into; your local MS Society chapter can help.
