**Weird police question, but can a cop pull you over at a red light and
tell you to run the light to pull over? Can a cop demand that you break
the law to pull you over or would that be considered entrapment?**

*Can* a police officer do this? Yes, they can. Is it entrapment? No, it
is not. You were following a lawful directive by a police officer.
Entrapment is when a government agent entices you to break a law that
you would not normally break. When an officer gives you a directive, you
are bound by law to follow it, or you could be charged with failing to
follow a lawful order. The order is lawful because a police officer gave
you the order while performing his official duty under color of law, not
because what he's asking you to do would be otherwise illegal. If it
were entrapment, then it would be a natural catch-22. You either follow
the directive and you are guilty of breaking the law, or you fail to
follow the directive and you are guilty of breaking the law.

In practice, the officer will simply wait behind you until the light
turns green and you are safely through the intersection before he
activates his lights. Or he'll activate his lights behind you at the red
light and he'll use the PA system to advise you that once the light
turns green you are to proceed through the intersection and then pull
over.
