<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The anonymous answerer assumed that the asker was asking<br>about police officers breaking the law in order to stop someone else<br>from breaking the law. It\'s really hard to answer on behalf of police<br>officers because I don\'t see many situations where a police officer<br>would have to break the law to do his job (stop someone else from<br>breaking the law). When a police 0fficer lies to a suspect to gain<br>his/her trust or to convince him/her that telling the truth is the best<br>alternative, this is perfectly legal and is all part of the game. Is it<br>morally right? Maybe not. But it\'s also not illegal, so it doesn\'t<br>answer the question. Police cars are not subject to vehicle and traffic<br>law because they are \"emergency vehicles.\" Traffic laws are applicable<br>to \"motor vehicles\" which police cars are not.\<br>\<br>(ED) I would also add that if a police officer had to break the law in<br>order to enforce the law, this would be what is called an \"affirmative<br>defense\" against the charge of the officer breaking the law. This would<br>only be applicable if there was no other way for the officer to stop the<br>perpetrator.\<br>\<br>I think it applies more to civilians breaking the law to stop other laws<br>from being broken. For example (and here\'s a biggie): let\'s say I\'m<br>acting as a civilian (not as a deputy \-- I straddle the line). As a<br>civilian, I cannot conceal a weapon in a school, even if I have a<br>concealed weapons permit (which I do). As an officer, I can, but not as<br>a civilian. Let\'s say I know that there is a student with a gun in the<br>school. Now the dilemma: should I illegally conceal a handgun on my<br>person and enter the school in order to be the armed resistance should<br>that student start shooting?\<br>\<br>I\'d be breaking the law, but I\'d meet the higher moral imperative of<br>saving lives at any cost. In that circumstance, I would be in clear<br>violation of the law, but breaking that law would be morally<br>right.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
