**Content:** [The anonymous answerer assumed that the asker was asking
about police officers breaking the law in order to stop someone else
from breaking the law. It\'s really hard to answer on behalf of police
officers because I don\'t see many situations where a police officer
would have to break the law to do his job (stop someone else from
breaking the law). When a police 0fficer lies to a suspect to gain
his/her trust or to convince him/her that telling the truth is the best
alternative, this is perfectly legal and is all part of the game. Is it
morally right? Maybe not. But it\'s also not illegal, so it doesn\'t
answer the question. Police cars are not subject to vehicle and traffic
law because they are \"emergency vehicles.\" Traffic laws are applicable
to \"motor vehicles\" which police cars are not.\
\
(ED) I would also add that if a police officer had to break the law in
order to enforce the law, this would be what is called an \"affirmative
defense\" against the charge of the officer breaking the law. This would
only be applicable if there was no other way for the officer to stop the
perpetrator.\
\
I think it applies more to civilians breaking the law to stop other laws
from being broken. For example (and here\'s a biggie): let\'s say I\'m
acting as a civilian (not as a deputy \-- I straddle the line). As a
civilian, I cannot conceal a weapon in a school, even if I have a
concealed weapons permit (which I do). As an officer, I can, but not as
a civilian. Let\'s say I know that there is a student with a gun in the
school. Now the dilemma: should I illegally conceal a handgun on my
person and enter the school in order to be the armed resistance should
that student start shooting?\
\
I\'d be breaking the law, but I\'d meet the higher moral imperative of
saving lives at any cost. In that circumstance, I would be in clear
violation of the law, but breaking that law would be morally
right.]{.rendered_qtext}
