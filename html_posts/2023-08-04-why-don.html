Jesus did tell a few people to quit their jobs and follow Him. He needed
disciples, and they couldn't rightly keep their jobs and follow Him at
the same time, so that kinda makes sense.

But He also told at least one guy that he needed to sell all his worldly
goods. Here's the passage:

> Just then a man came up to Jesus and asked, "Teacher, what good thing
> must I do to get eternal life?"
>
> "Why do you ask me about what is good?" Jesus replied. "There is only
> One who is good. If you want to enter life, keep the commandments."
>
> "Which ones?" he inquired.
>
> Jesus replied, "'You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery,
> you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, honor your
> father and mother,' and 'love your neighbor as yourself.'"
>
> "All these I have kept," the young man said. "What do I still lack?"
>
> Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions
> and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come,
> follow me."
>
> When the young man heard this, he went away sad, because he had great
> wealth.
>
> Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for
> someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you,
> it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for
> someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God." --- Matthew

*See?* you're saying right now. *It says right there! You have to sell
all your possessions and you will have treasure in heaven!*

While I don't doubt that you will indeed have treasure in heaven if you
sell all your possessions, this was not a command from Jesus to us. We
already have the Great Commandments: Love the Lord your God, and love
your neighbor. Then what's the story with this whole "sell all your
possessions" thing?

See, *Jesus knew the rich man's heart before he spoke a word.* Jesus
knew the rich man loved his money more than Him. So Jesus told him to do
the one thing that He knew the man would not do: part with the one true
love of his life; his money. The rich man went away sad, because he
realized that in order to gain heaven, he would have to give up the love
of money.

We are told in the Bible that the love of money is the root of all evil.
And this rich man loved money, so he was ill-equipped to enter heaven.
Jesus knew that this rich man would not "come and follow me" while he
still had his money, because he loved it too much.

Can you *have* money and not *love* money? Certainly. You can know that
money makes life easier, but it doesn't solve problems, and it doesn't
take away sin. Only Jesus can do that. Only Jesus is the way to heaven,
not money. Money doesn't get you to heaven. That's why Jesus turns to
the disciples and tells them that the rich person (one obsessed with the
love of money) will never make it to heaven. It would be easier for a
camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to go to
heaven, Jesus said.

While it is possible for rich people to go to heaven, it is not easy.
Jesus basically says that *all* of his followers must abandon the
various forms of wealth in order to follow Him: money, property,
security, family, prestige, or popularity. But Jesus also assures them
that *"The things that are impossible with people are possible with
God"* (Luke 18:27 ESV).

But what we **gain** far outpaces anything we **lose**.

And that's the point. Everything in this life is fleeting, but what we
gain in exchange is *far greater* than anything we give up here.
