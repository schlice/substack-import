**Is the police trained to deal with a suicide in progress, such as when
they arrive, and the person is already sawing away their wrists?**

Not every situation requires specialized training.

If you came upon that situation, what would you do?

You would use reasonable force to stop that person from harming
themselves further, and call medical personnel to treat existing
injuries, and take the person into a 72 hour psych hold.
