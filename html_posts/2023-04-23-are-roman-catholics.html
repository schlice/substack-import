This is absolutely a valid question, and of course turns on what the
definition of "Christianity" is.

Christianity is a term describing a number of religious groups which
believe in Jesus Christ as one member of the Trinity, both fully human
and fully divine, who died as a penal substitution for us, sacrificing
himself as payment for our sin, and who rose from the dead three days
later, to overcome death and pave the way for humanity to be reunited
with God.

Based on that really loose definition, Catholics are indeed Christian.

From there, though, our two beliefs begin to diverge. Among other
differences:

- Christians believe in one source for the word of God: the Bible.
  Catholics believe in three: the Bible, the Magisterium (the collection
  of priests, bishops, cardinals, and the Pope), and sacred church
  traditions.
- Catholics believe that at the Last Supper, when Jesus passed around
  the bread and said "this is my body" and then passed around the cup
  and said "this is my blood," He was turning those objects into his
  ***literal*** body and blood. Christians believe that Jesus was, once
  again, teaching in parables, as He did throughout His entire life.
  There is exegesis that supports either view, so both beliefs carry on
  to today.
- Catholics believe you can lose your salvation. Christians believe in
  "once saved, always saved."
- Christians believe that it is only faith in Christ which saves you
  (*sola fide*). Catholics believe in *faith plus*, as in faith plus
  following the traditions of the church, or faith plus regularly eating
  the bread and drinking the cup.

There are plenty of other differences, this is just a brief highlight.
There are other things (i.e. the transcendence of Mary, intercessory
prayer, etc) which differ between our belief sets.

TL;DR: When it comes to the big things, Christianity and Catholicism
believe the same. But once we get down to the details, there are
significant differences.
