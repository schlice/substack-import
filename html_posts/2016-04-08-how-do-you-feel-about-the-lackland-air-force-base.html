Looks like this was a murder-suicide. An airman shot his commander, then
shot himself.

These are far more common than you apparently know. There are anywhere
between 1,000 and 1,500 deaths annually from murder-suicide, and these
numbers are probably wrong as some crimes are not reported. In 2011
alone, there were 1,382 murder-suicide deaths in the United States.

*I hope you\'re as upset as I am that these shooting are still
happening.*

Until you can stop hatred, jealousy, and mental instability, these will
keep happening.
