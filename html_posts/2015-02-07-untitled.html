**Content:** [*So\...If I can\'t see it and there is no proof that means
it does exist because lack of proof and evidence is what makes things
real in reality.*\
\
As Ron White said, \"You can\'t fix stupid. Stupid is forever.\" That\'s
not what I said *at all.* Go back and read it again. But in case my
answer was too confusing for you, I\'ll try to dumb it down a bit.\
\
What I said was that **you cannot prove that God does not exist.**\
\
I also said that **I cannot prove that God does exist.**\
\
Then, I said that **you and I** ***both*** **operate on** ***faith*.**
Since you cannot prove that God does not exist, **you are therefore
speaking on the basis of** ***faith*** **when you say that he does
not.**\
\
Similarly, **I am speaking on** ***faith*** **when I say that God does
exist.**\
\
Finally, I said that your leap of faith was much bigger than mine.
Former atheist Lee Strobel said, \"Essentially, I realized that to stay
an atheist, I had to believe that nothing produces everything, non-life
produces life, randomness produces fine-tuning, chaos produces
information, unconsciousness produces consciousness, and non-reason
produces reason. Those leaps of faith were simply too big for me to
take\[.\]\"\
\
He also said that the Christian worldview better accounted for the
totality of the evidence than the atheistic worldview.\
\
But that\'s a very in-depth discussion which is not suitable for this
forum.\
\
Plus. I don\'t think you\'ll get it. You are not in a state of mind to
be able to listen and try to comprehend. So I\'ll save my metaphorical
breath.]{.rendered_qtext}
