You're correct, they are *human rights*, not person's rights.

But at the very least, if we establish "personhood," we could then apply
the same laws which protect "persons" we already have, such as the right
to life, and to not have that life taken without due process of law.

Nevertheless, we keep fishing around for a way to either ban all
abortions or permit all abortions nationwide, which at least for now,
we're not going to get.

We have **correctly** returned the abortion debate to the states, where
it currently belongs. States, and the voters in those states, get to
decide how their state spends their money. The state gets to decide
whether they will allow any abortions in that state, and if so, if there
are to be any limits to that.

If, at some point, we get a plurality of people in at least 3/4 of the
states who either agree that all abortions should be banned or that all
abortions should be permitted, we can pass a Constitutional amendment to
say that. But for now, leaving this privilege to decide up to the states
(and to the people, respectively) is exactly what the Constitution
intended.
