The Supreme Court is being asked to clarify the extent of the
President\'s power to remove heads of independent agencies, particularly
when those agencies are designed to be independent from direct
presidential control. This issue arises from cases where the President
has attempted to remove officials from these agencies, and the officials
have argued that their removal is unconstitutional due to the agency\'s
independent status.

**The core question is whether the President\'s power to remove
officials, as outlined in the Constitution, extends to these
"independent agencies," and, if so, under what circumstances.**

The Constitution grants the President the power to appoint and remove
certain federal officials, but it doesn\'t explicitly address the
removal of heads of independent agencies.

Several SCOTUS cases talk about this issue, but none address it
completely. These two cases form the core of the issue being decided by
SCOTUS. They are:

- *Myers v. United States (1926):* This Supreme Court case established
  that the President has broad removal power over executive branch
  officials, but the context of independent agencies wasn\'t directly
  addressed.
- *Humphrey\'s Executor v. United States (1935):* This case limited the
  President\'s removal power over officials in agencies Congress created
  to be independent, emphasizing that the nature of the office and the
  intent of Congress in establishing the agency should be considered.

Recent attempts by a President to remove heads of independent agencies,
like the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and the Merit Systems
Protection Board (MSPB), have triggered legal challenges that reach the
Supreme Court.

The central issue is whether the President\'s power to remove officials
is *absolute* or whether it can be *limited* by Congress in establishing
independent agencies. The Court is being asked to review the tension
between *Myers* and *Humphrey's Executor.* In *Myers*, the Court held
that the President has unlimited power to remove executive officials he
appointed. That case emphasized the need for **unitary executive
control** to ensure the President can "take Care that the Laws be
faithfully executed" (Article II Clause 2). *Humphrey's Executor*,
however, established that **Congress can restrict removal** of officials
in **independent agencies** (like the FTC) who perform quasi-legislative
or quasi-judicial roles. The case differentiated these officials from
purely executive ones, protecting them from at-will removal.

The progression of cases over time shows that the Court has moved from
rigid "executive control" toward functional analysis---examining whether
removal restrictions **impede the President's ability to perform** core
constitutional duties. That is what is at issue in this case: Do the
limits imposed in *Humphrey's Executive* (et seq) constitute an
*unconstitutional limitation* of the President's ability to perform his
**core Constitutional duties** under Article II Clause 2?

Depending on the Supreme Court\'s decision, there could be further legal
challenges and ongoing debates about the balance of power between the
executive and the other branches of government.
