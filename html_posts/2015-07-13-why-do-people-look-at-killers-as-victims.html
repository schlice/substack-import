If that were the case (that suspects couldn\'t actually also be
victims), then there would be no need for defense in our legal system.
If the facts were present, you go straight to jail. Suspects can have
mitigating circumstances that cause them to do what they do. Just
because they are a suspect doesn\'t mean that they aren\'t a victim of
another set of circumstances as well.

If we want to focus only on **punishment**, then your sentiment is
correct: they are criminals, they get punished, end of story.

If, however, we also want to try to prevent **future crimes**, we have
to try to figure out why they did what they did. What we discovered was
a \"bullying\" culture in some schools that led to the creation of
killers like Klebold and Harris. As a society, that we allowed this to
happen is ***our*** failure.

Since then, schools have adopted zero-tolerance policies on bullying and
bullying behavior. Teachers have been trained to recognize and put an
end to bullying behavior. It\'s much much better than it was 15 years
ago in Littleton. It\'s certainly not perfect, but it\'s much much
better.
