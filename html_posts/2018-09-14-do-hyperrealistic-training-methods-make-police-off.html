**Do hyperrealistic training methods make police officers more paranoid
and likely to use deadly force on the job?**

So, now I'm *really* confused.

First it was that police officers were using deadly force because they
*didn't have enough training*.

So we get them more training. Even *so-called hyper-realistic* training.

**Now**, we have the audacity to say they have had *too much*
training???

The article points out the problem with this exercise:

> *But what about the consequences of a mistake? After all, that dark

> occasional training scenario may even make that point. But officers

But the article's solution says that officers need to be taught "beyond
the gun belt." They need to be taught not only that there will be risks,
but also "the likelihood of those risks materializing." So, to translate
into human-speak, they're basically telling the officer that they
*shouldn't* shoot because it's really unlikely that the other person is
actually armed. It's statistically more likely that the object in that
person's hands *actually is* a wallet, not a gun.

Also, the article says that police should be taught about how
"unconscious racial bias" leads officers to perceive a greater threat
from black men than from others. So again, translating to human-speak,
we should pause before shooting because our stupid brains are
unconsciously tricking us into thinking that the person is actually
dangerous because he's black.

**And that moment's hesitation, while we wrestle with what our instincts
tell us versus what our new** ***socially-conscious,
politically-correct*** **training tells us, we're shot. And instead of
going home to our families in our cars, we're going home to our families
in the coroner's van, all because we hesitated.**

But that's okay, right? It's okay that a police officer dies instead of
a suspect, because "the officer signed up to do a dangerous job."

Seriously, I searched the entire job description for a police officer,
and I literally did not see anywhere in it where it says, "Gets killed
when necessary." Yes, the job has risks. But the only job where you sign
up to give your life when needed is the Armed Forces of the United
States. You do not sign up to die for someone breaking the law when you
join the police force. Granted, you'll do whatever it takes to protect
civilians, including standing in the way of bullets, but when it comes
down to **me or him**, I'm going home in my car.

Additionally, that officer is *still* a US citizen, and has the same
right of self-defense as any other US citizen. He has every right to
perceive a threat to his life (regardless if that threat is induced by
training or experience or general life experience) and to act
accordingly. Any citizen in the same situation would be able to react in
exactly the same way and still claim self-defense. Or are you actually
going to try to claim that a police officer has *less* of a right to
self-defense because he's wearing a certain uniform or working for the
government? I have never heard of a situation where a government
employee ***loses Constitutional guarantees*** simply because they work
for the government. As a trained military member, I *constantly*
perceive threats all around me. So does my training make me more likely
to shoot someone in self-defense than anyone else? Do I need to be
*re-trained* that those threats that I've been *trained to see* really
are just my brain playing tricks on me?

Thankfully, the law doesn't work that way. The law regarding
self-defense says that *I need to perceive that my life is threatened*.
It has no bearing on the legality of the self-defense claim whether the
threat was *actually real or not*. The only factor is whether or not I
perceived a threat. My perception is colored by my life experience, and
everyone's life experience is different. Hey, I've got a great idea:
***don't threaten people and you won't get shot.***

I just keep coming back to that one phrase: *better judged by 12 than
carried by 6.* If this phrase is true, and cops believe it, then nothing
is going to change, and any of this "feel-good" training may make *you*
feel better, but it will only make cops dead-er.

But again, some are probably okay with that. Because racism and
statistics, but mostly racism.
