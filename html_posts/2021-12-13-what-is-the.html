There are a few, but the undisputed winner in the "Android AirTag"
category, by far, is
[[**Tile**](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f0f6e7&url=https://www.thetileapp.com/){.external_link

Tile is a very solid counterpart to AirTags, and it has the flexibility
to work with more than just Apple products (Tile does work on iPhone).
They have a number of different styles of Tile trackers to choose from,
but the one which matches the AirTag the closest is the Tile Mate. At
the time of this writing, a Tile Mate is on sale for \$19.99, and a
two-pack is on sale for \$37.99. So for about \$8 more than a single
AirTag, you can buy **two** Tile Mate tags.

The Tile Mate is a little larger than the AirTag, but it has a keychain
hole in it, so you don't need an accessory to attach it to stuff. It
does only come in white and black, but it has support for third-party
cases if you want to change the color.

The Tile Pro is a little larger, has a little better range, and runs off
of a battery you replace (as opposed to the rest of the Tile lineup,
which have non-replaceable 3-year batteries).

Like AirTags, the Tile Mate uses Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) to connect to
your Android phone or tablet. The range of the Tile Mate is advertised
as 250 feet, which is pretty good and is usually more than enough for
what you'll need.

What happens if you're not in that range? The Tile app will show you
where the tracker was when last connected. If that's not enough, you can
mark it "Lost" in the app and crowdsource other Tile users to help you
find it.

For \$3 per month or \$30 a year, you can subscribe to "Tile Premium"
for some additional features like Smart Alerts (your phone alerts you
when your Tile goes out of range), 30 Day Location History, Unlimited
Sharing and Free Battery Replacements (for Tile units with replaceable
batteries).
