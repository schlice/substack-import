**If, as the White House says, Trump has no compromised relationship
with Russia, why does he go out of his way to hide his interactions with
Putin?**

There could be several reasons for this.

First, Trump is a businessman, not a politician. As a businessman and
CEO, he routinely does things "on his own," without the assistance of
aides and assistants. This may be one of his negotiating tactics which
he uses to ensure that the person with whom he is negotiating feels open
to interaction, because only Trump is the keeper of that information.

Secondly, Trump's organization leaks like a sieve. Trump can never be
sure that any of his aides or assistants can keep a secret. No amount of
military-level classification of information will stop today's leakers
from leaking. So he may be holding this information close to his vest
specifically to keep it from leaking.
