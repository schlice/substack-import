Can a company with established race-neutral grooming standards fire
someone who violates those standards? Yes, absolutely. This is perfectly
legal. So can someone be fired because they wear dreadlocks? Short
answer: yes.

However, the petitioner claimed that her dreadlocks were
characteristically African-American, and so the firing violated **racial
discrimination** laws.

The facts in this case are as follows:

> CMS, a claims processing company located in Mobile, Alabama, provides
> customer service support to insurance companies. In 2010, CMS
> announced that it was seeking candidates with basic computer knowledge
> and professional phone skills to work as customer service
> representatives. CMS' customer representatives do not have contact
> with the public, as they handle telephone calls in a large call room.
>
> Ms. Jones, who is black, completed an online employment application
> for the customer service position in May of 2010, and was selected for
> an in-person interview. She arrived at CMS for her interview several
> days later dressed in a blue business suit and wearing her hair in
> short dreadlocks.
>
> After waiting with a number of other applicants, Ms. Jones interviewed
> with a company representative to discuss the requirements of the
> position. A short time later, Ms. Jones and other selected applicants
> were brought into a room as a group.
>
> CMS' human resources manager, Jeannie Wilson---who is white---informed
> the applicants in the room, including Ms. Jones, that they had been
> hired. Ms. Wilson also told the successful applicants that they would
> have to complete scheduled lab tests and other paperwork before
> beginning their employment, and she offered to meet privately with
> anyone who had a conflict with CMS' schedule. As of this time no one
> had commented on Ms. Jones' hair.
>
> Following the meeting, Ms. Jones met with Ms. Wilson privately to
> discuss a scheduling conflict she had and to request to change her lab
> test date. Ms. Wilson told Ms. Jones that she could return at a
> different time for the lab test.
>
> Before Ms. Jones got up to leave, Ms. Wilson asked her whether she had
> her hair in dreadlocks. Ms. Jones said yes, and Ms. Wilson replied
> that CMS could not hire her "with the dreadlocks." When Ms. Jones
> asked what the problem was, Ms. Wilson said "they tend to get messy,
> although I'm not saying yours are, but you know what I'm talking
> about." Ms. Wilson told Ms. Jones about a male applicant who was asked
> to cut off his dreadlocks in order to obtain a job with CMS.
>
> When Ms. Jones said that she would not cut her hair, Ms. Wilson told
> her that CMS could not hire her, and asked her to return the paperwork
> she had been given. Ms. Jones did as requested and left.
>
> At the time, CMS had a race-neutral grooming policy which read as
> follows: "All personnel are expected to be dressed and groomed in a
> manner that projects a professional and businesslike image while
> adhering to company and industry standards and/or guidelines. . . .
> \[H\]airstyle should reflect a business/professional image. No
> excessive hairstyles or unusual colors are acceptable\[.\]"

The petitioner claimed that dreadlocks are a racially-connected
hairstyle, and thus CMS was firing her because she wore a
characteristically African-American hairstyle, which would be racial
discrimination.

Both the lower court, and the court of appeals, found that dreadlocks
are not an immutable characteristic of a person, and therefore do not
fall under one of the protected characteristics in Title VII (the Civil
Rights Act). The district court dismissed the complaint because "Title
VII prohibits discrimination on the basis of immutable characteristics,
such as race, color, or natural origin," and "\[a\] hairstyle, even one
more closely associated with a particular ethnic group, is a mutable
characteristic." In other words, it's not racial discrimination to be
fired because of a hairstyle, even if it is a characteristically
African-American hairstyle. The Court of Appeals concurred.

Because the company's grooming standards are race-neutral, and the
company found that dreadlocks are in violation of that standard, the
termination is lawful.
