Short answer: yes.

Longer answer: The actual *mark* you apply to the paper is irrelevant.
The fact remains, you signed the paper. This is why a single line, or
even an X, are valid signatures. When you are asked to testify, and the
lawyer shows you the paper with the fake signature, and he asks you,
\"Did you sign this paper with this mark?\" how are you going to answer?

If you used the fake signature in an attempt to defraud the company by
violating the privacy policy and/or ethics code and then claiming you
never received the training and never signed the form, not only can you
be sued for privacy and/or ethics violations, you will also be sued for
fraud for intentionally trying to defraud the company.

And after all of that is concluded, you\'ll be terminated for cause,
which means no follow-on benefits. They walk you to the door.
