For completeness, the relevant phrase in the 5th Amendment states: "nor
shall private property be taken for public use, without just
compensation." Article 17 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
says, "(1) Everyone has the right to own property alone as well as in
association with others. (2) No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his
property."

There is no contradiction here. The UDHR says that no one shall be
**arbitrarily** deprived of his property. *Arbitrary* means "based on
random choice or personal whim, rather than any reason or system." We
have a system by which we compensate individuals when private property
must be taken for public use. It is a system of just compensation, as
required in the 5th Amendment. And the land must be taken for "public
use," not at random, or for personal desires.
