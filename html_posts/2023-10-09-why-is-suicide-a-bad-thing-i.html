Because you actually want to live.

If someone forcefully covers your mouth and nose, do you just sit there
peacefully and wait for the oxygen in your lungs to be replaced by
carbon dioxide? ***NO!*** You struggle mightily to breathe. If you are
drowning, do you just float away and accept your fate? ***NO!*** You
fight to get to the surface and breathe. When you are injured and your
body struggles to stay alive, it is yet another indication that your
body wants to live.

If your mind is telling you that you don't want to live, then **there is
a disconnect between your mind and your body.** Your body wants to live,
but your mind does not. This disconnect can cause a great deal of
anxiety in your life.

If this is happening to you, **seek help**. I know that seeing a mental
health professional has never been considered to be a good thing to do,
but if you need help (and this disconnect between your mind and your
body should be telling you that you do), seek the advice of a mental
health professional near you. If you feel like you might hurt yourself,
call 988 in the United States (or any of the numbers in the "There Is
Help" box on this page), or go to your nearest Emergency Room.
