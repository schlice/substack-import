**Why has the service stopped on my Huawei phone? It was ok from October
until a week or so ago. Now I just get emergency only. What could the
problem be?**

One of two problems could be happening here:

1.  Your SIM card is loose. Pop your SIM tray, try cleaning it out with
    compressed air, and re-inserting it. You may need to power-cycle the
    phone.
2.  Your service has been disconnected. Check with your carrier and
    validate your contract status.
