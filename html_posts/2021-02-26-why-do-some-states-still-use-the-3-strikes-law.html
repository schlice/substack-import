**Why do some states still use the 3-strikes law?**

So before we talk about why some states still have them, let's define
them.

The "three strikes law" is what most states refer to as "habitual
offender" or "habitual felon" laws. Under these **sentencing rules**,
upon conviction for a third felony (rules vary by state), the defendant
is subject to a mandatory life sentence, or a mandatory minimum 25 years
to life sentence, depending on the state.

There are variations among the states. In some states, all of the three
crimes must be violent felonies before the mandatory sentence is
enacted; in others, at least one of the three felonies must be a violent
crime before the law is enacted. So in some cases, a defendant could
have several previous felonies on the books, and then just commit one
violent felony, and face a life sentence.

The common complaint here is an Eighth Amendment challenge, and comes
down to one of *proportionality*. The famous test case in this regard is
*Rummel v. Estelle* in 1980. The Supreme Court upheld a Texas
three-strikes law under which Rummel was sentenced to life with parole
after three property theft felonies, the grand total sum of all three
crimes was approximately \$230. While the upholding of the Texas law was
certainly notable, what was more interesting was the follow-on. Texas
courts (and others) now use the case as a proportionality test, and most
commonly they find that the application of the Texas three-strikes law
is proportional, "given that Rummel\'s life sentence for a small felony
conviction which only involved misappropriation of a small amount of
property, enhanced by his two prior convictions both involving similar
offenses and both involving small amounts of property, was upheld by the
United States Supreme Court."[\[1\]](#mzMJZ){#cite-mzMJZ .citation_link}

Ultimately, your question was why do states still have these laws. The
reason any state continues in any particular sentencing policy is
because *they believe it works*. In any honest analysis of these laws,
we find contradictory evidence at best, but some states still believe
that these laws reduce crime.
