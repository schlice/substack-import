**Are school shootings responsible for CounterStrike?**

School shootings: a (likely) unstable former student decides to get
revenge on all of the people whom he feels "wronged" him in some way and
takes a gun into a school and starts shooting anyone he sees, with
absolutely no armed resistance whatsoever. It's a free-fire zone.

[[*Counter-Strike: Global
Offensive*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f45331&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive){.external_link

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} (affectionately known as
CS:GO): An online first-person shooter multiplayer video game which pits
a team of "terrorists" and "counter-terrorists" against each other in
fictional cityscapes full of boxes, cars, buildings, windows, ramps and
nary an innocent bystander anywhere to be seen (if you see a person,
they're either on your team, or they're not). Both teams work to
eliminate each other while working on other objectives (planting or
defusing bombs, and defending or rescuing hostages). You communicate
with your team and direct tactical movement, call out enemy positions
when you see them, and are generally equally matched with your opponents
in terms of available firepower (note to hardcore CS:GO players: I'm not
talking about purchase ability and funds available based on round
wins/losses; I'm talking about the difference between two \[generally\]
balanced, armed teams vs one shooter and all unarmed victims).

If you can make the stretch from school shootings to CS:GO, you've got
quite an imagination.
