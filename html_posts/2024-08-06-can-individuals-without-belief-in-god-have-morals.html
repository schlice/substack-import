Certainly! They can absolutely have morals, ethics and values, and they
can consider those things "right" and the opposite of those things
"wrong."

***But without a universal standard of right and wrong which applies to
all people at all times,*** *then what* ***they*** *consider to be
"right" or "wrong" may not be what* ***everyone else*** *considers to be
"right" or "wrong."*

For example, said atheist may believe that it is morally right to kill
you and take all of your stuff, because they believe that "survival of
the fittest" is the ethically correct way to live. Morally speaking, if
everyone makes their own morals, and it's okay for everyone to make
their own morals, then this person would be acting "morally right," as
far as he was concerned.

If you're the one they are killing, however, then it's likely that you
wouldn't believe that their morals are very "right," now would you.

I know, killing is a poor example to use, because everyone knows that
it's wrong to kill.

Huh, that's interesting. *Everyone knows that it's wrong to kill*. **How
is that possible**? I mean, if there is no God, if there is no
*overarching* moral authority to which every human is accountable, how
is it possible that killing is wrong for everyone, everywhere?

Something to think about.
