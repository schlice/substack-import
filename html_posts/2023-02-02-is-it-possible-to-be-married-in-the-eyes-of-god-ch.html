I think the question we would need to answer is **why**.

If you intend to be married and to stay together, why not have a
ceremony? Sure, there may be situations where a ceremony is either
impractical or some other legal or social situation keeps people from
actually getting married. I would strongly suggest you fix that issue
first, and then get married.

The truth of the matter is that you make a vow *not only* before God,
but you make that vow *in front of family and friends*. Why are family
and friends important to be present at a wedding? If you have only made
a private commitment but not a public one, it can appear as an ungodly
relationship to others.

People also reject Christianity because they think Christians are
hypocrites, but the marriage ceremony lets everyone know publicly of
your intent to live together as husband and wife, and that you are also
honoring God's instructions on the sanctity of the marriage union
between a man and his wife.

There are several other reasons I can think of:

- **Accountability**. While I don't doubt your sincerity, it is
  certainly true that couples who are not formally married can walk away
  from that vow much more easily. A couple who is not formally married
  has an "easy out" and they usually take it.
- **Legal issues**. If you are not legally married, there are issues
  related to government functions which may not be resolved, such as
  taxes, spousal privilege with relation to healthcare decisions, and
  transfer of real property.
- **Generational issues**. There could be some legal issues regarding
  generativity (determining the "family tree" of children) if you don't
  have a legal marriage in place.

It is for these reasons that I think private ceremonies are unwise.
