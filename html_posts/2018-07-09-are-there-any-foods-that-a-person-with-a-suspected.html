**Are there any foods that a person with a suspected MS should avoid?**

Let's go past the "healthy eating" information that we all know. You're
asking if any foods make it more likely or less likely to get the
disease, or for the disease to progress.

The short answer is no. **There is no diet that will either "cure" MS,
or will "make your actual disease advance more quickly or slowly."**

However, there is ample anecdotal evidence that *diet can help to make
symptoms less severe.* See the Wahls Protocol and the Swank MS Diet for
more information. The caveat is that while symptoms may be less severe,
the disease continues to progress.

The only thing you can do to slow down the disease itself is to get on
one of the approved MS drugs. Full stop.

There is also a growing body of research which suggests that
aggressively treating suspected MS is crucial to long-term reduction in
disability. Aggressive treatment means getting on the MS drugs *sooner
rather than later*. Rather than waiting for suspected MS to develop into
full-blown MS, starting the drugs early limits the earliest disease
activity, which prevents long-term damage from MS. This research
recently appeared in the journal *Neurology* and it was issued by the
American Academy of Neurology which published new guidelines for MS
treatment, including a new series of recommendations for how and when a
neurologist should prescribe MS drugs.

In summary: foods won't make a difference in whether or not suspected MS
will turn into full MS. Getting on one of the disease modifying therapy
drugs might.
