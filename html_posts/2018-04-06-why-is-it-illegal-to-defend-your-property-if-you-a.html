**Why is it illegal to defend your property if you are not in any
immediate danger yourself? Shouldn\'t you be able to protect your
belongings? (United States)**

As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."

It's not illegal to defend your property. It's just that state laws vary
when defining how much force you are allowed to use when defending your
property. Most laws allow you to use "reasonable and appropriate" force
to defend your property, but specifically disallow you from using
**deadly force** while defending your property unless your life is
threatened and not just your property.

As an example, see Colorado Revised Statute 18--1--706, Use of physical
force in defense of property.

Check your state laws regarding what level of force you can use to
defend your property in your state.
