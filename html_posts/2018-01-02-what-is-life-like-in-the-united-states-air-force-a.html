Academically, which is what you asked, it is tough.

15 credit hours would be a heavy load at a civilian college. At the Air
Force Academy, that is the *bare minimum* you can carry in a semester. A
20--24 credit hour load is average, and there is really no such thing as
"study hall" at the Academy. Until you are a late-term senior and have
completed most of the classes for your academic major will you ever
potentially have free blocks in your schedule. I didn't ever see a free
block until second semester senior year.

You get homework in every one of your classes. In fact, you get more
homework than you can conceivably do in a night (or two nights, on a
block schedule). Therefore, you have to learn how to *prioritize* what
work is important, and what work you can blow off. Actually, this is a
very useful life skill to learn, and practicing it while you are earning
your degree isn't a bad way to go.

You also have to be able to shift gears quickly, between academics,
athletics, and military studies. In most cases, time is blocked out for
each activity, but on many days, military studies will often be
interspersed in the academic day (for you grads, I'm referring to M5).
Therefore, your study skills must be up to snuff; you must be able to
study efficiently, and use the limited time you have effectively.

Each weeknight from 8:00 PM to 11:00 PM is Academic Call to Quarters
(ACQ or "ack call") and is reserved for homework and study time. Three
hours a night are all that are "reserved" for study time, but if you
have other free time, obviously you can use it for study. Be aware,
though, that throughout most of your career, you won't have other free
time besides ACQ. If your study skills are not up to snuff, study skills
training is available.
