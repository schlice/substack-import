Before you call 911, you should assess the situation yourself. From your
question, you made it seem like you saw something and you immediately
called 911 without ensuring that the person actually needed medical
attention.

But if you actually assessed the situation by talking to the victim, and
if you determined, *to the best of your non-doctor's opinion*, that the
person needed an ambulance, **call an ambulance**. Even if it turns out
that they didn't need medical attention, you still did your due
diligence, and as far as you could see, medical attention was needed.

You can't be faulted for honestly, truthfully believing that medical
attention was needed. You're not a doctor. You're not expected to know
precisely whether or not medical attention was needed. You assessed the
situation to the best of your ability and you made a judgement. ***This
will never be faulted***.

A false alarm would occur if you either did not assess the situation, or
you assessed the situation, *determined that an ambulance was* ***not***
*needed,* but you called one anyway.

If see another person who appears to be injured, you call 911 for an
ambulance, and they turn out to not have anything wrong with them, is
that considered a false alarm?
