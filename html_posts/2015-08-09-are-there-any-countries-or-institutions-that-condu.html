**Content:** [Police in the United States routinely perform frisk
activities on the opposite sex. Pro tip: if you want to avoid groping
allegations, the sensitive areas are searched with the back of the hand.
It is very difficult to grope someone with the back of your hand, and it
is still sufficiently sensitive to feel for weapons.]{.rendered_qtext}
