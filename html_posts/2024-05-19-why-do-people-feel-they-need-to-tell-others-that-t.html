If you found out about a gift that was being offered to anyone, free of
charge, which improved the quality of your life dramatically, would you
not want to tell others about it? Wouldn't you want as many people as
possible to know about this free gift?

I know, nothing in life is free, but this gift is. Truly free. You don't
owe anyone anything for accepting this gift.

Would you *not* tell everyone you met about it? Isn't that just a wee
bit *selfish?*
