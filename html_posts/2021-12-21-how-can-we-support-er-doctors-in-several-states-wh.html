Tell them to either:

1.  Quit lying to you to try to scare you into supporting them
2.  Go back to school and learn what triage is.

I can guarantee you that no one is being refused life-saving care
because they are "too busy" with COVID-19 patients.

Patients are seen based on their *criticality*, not whether or not a
patient has COVID-19. A process known as *triage* takes place when you
arrive at a hospital. They determine just how critical your case is, and
you are seen in the order of your criticality.

This is what determines when patients get seen. So it doesn't matter who
has what, what matters is where they fall on the criticality chart. The
highest category cases are seen first.

Now, what you may be actually hearing is the fact that *hospitals are
very busy*, and 30--40% of their cases may be COVID-19 cases. It is also
true that in some smaller regional hospitals (which were already running
at 80% of capacity under normal operating conditions), the surge of
COVID-19 cases may be causing them to run out of regular beds.

It is at that time that the hospital should be implementing its
emergency plans. Just as we did at the beginning of the COVID-19
pandemic, we should be converting sections of the hospital into ICU
space or COVID-19 space or triage space, depending on what is needed.

And if the hospital implements their emergency plans and they *still*
run out of space? They should be calling on the state for assistance.

For a hospital to overrun its total beds and allow any patients to be
turned away is a travesty of hospital administration, and a failure to
implement emergency plans in a timely manner. A hospital administrator
should lose his or her job over such a failure.

Original question:

How can we support ER doctors in several states who say they\'re being
forced to refuse life-saving care to patients, as 30 to 40% beds are
tied up with COVID-19 cases?
