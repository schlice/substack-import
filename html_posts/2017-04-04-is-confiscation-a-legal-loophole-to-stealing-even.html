Confiscation and stealing have two completely different definitions.
Teachers can confiscate phones in a school setting. If a teacher saw you
at Wal-Mart and "confiscated" your phone, that would be stealing. But in
a school setting, it is not.

In a school setting, teachers often do act as *guardians ad litem*,
since you are usually minors whom your parents have left at the school
with the teachers in charge of you. This, combined with the necessity to
maintain the academic environment for all students, gives them the
ability and the legal authority to confiscate your device.

I think that confiscating a phone until the end of class is reasonable.
Perhaps confiscating the phone until the end of the day in extreme
situations might be somewhat defensible, but I still question it. I do
not think that confiscating a phone for any longer is reasonable at all.
If I were the parent, I would be having a chat with that teacher and the
school administration if such a policy existed school-wide.
