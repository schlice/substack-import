Interesting answers you've gotten so far. Maybe next time you should ask
your question in a Christian Space instead of out into the global Quora
landscape. I'd recommend [[Christians and

Nevertheless, you've asked here, and I found it, so I can provide you
with a real answer.

There's nothing specifically about pornography in the Bible, so you're
probably thinking that some porn isn't all that bad. In fact, **70% of
Christian men admit to watching porn**, so you're not alone.

Clearly, watching *violent* porn would be bad, but what about pictures
or video of *consenting adults*? Don't men, especially men who have
higher libidos than their wives, have a natural need to alleviate that
urge in a healthy way?

So let me re-phrase your question into one that a Christian could
understand a little better:

**Is watching porn a sin?**

In order to answer that question, we need to understand what *sin* is.
Basically, sin is anything which takes us off-course from the life that
God has created us to live. In other words, sin is any choice or
behavior that takes us away from God's good plan for us.

If we're honest with ourselves, we can probably identify a few ways in
which pornography is objectively wrong:

- Objectifying people as sex objects
- Promoting and encouraging forms of violence and sex trafficking
  associated with the porn industry

But the true danger of porn is more fundamental, and it is the
explanation for why porn is sinful: **porn leads us away from God's good
plan for us.**

While the Bible doesn't specifically mention pornography, it definitely
mentions looking lustfully at a woman.

King David was one of the first documented to "watch porn" in the Bible.
He had an affair with a woman named Bathsheeba, and then to cover up his
crime, he had her husband Uriah killed. But for this context, the first
part of this story is the one we want to highlight:

> One evening, David got up from his bed and walked around on the roof
> of the palace. From the roof, he saw a woman bathing. The woman was
> very beautiful. --- 2 Samuel 11:2

The whole sordid tale of adultery and murder started with David, for all
intents and purposes, "watching porn." He saw Bathsheeba taking a bath,
and instead of looking away immediately, he kept looking, and *lusting*
after her. Everything that happened to him after this began with David
willingly starting down that pathway of sin.

Jesus talked about it when He said:

> "You have heard that it was said, 'YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT ADULTERY'; but
> I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust for her has
> already committed adultery with her in his heart."--- Matthew 5:27--28
> NIV

We see here that looking lustfully at a woman is sinful, and you have
"already committed adultery with her in your heart." But Jesus is
describing something that still affects us, even today: **an affair of
the body always begins with an affair of the mind.** He taught that the
plan wasn't to only keep us from using our body in a sinful way. Jesus
was calling His followers to use their whole self --- heart, soul, and
mind --- to glorify God. If we *choose* to walk the pathway of mental
adultery, we are already off-course from what God has planned for us.

You're probably telling yourself at this point, *Yeah, but I'd never let
sin control me like that; I'd never let it go that far.* You may be
surprised to hear that for people in recovery from sexual addiction,
**not a single one had ever intentionally planned to ruin a marriage, a
career, or a family.** Every single person believed that they would
never let sin control them like that, and that they'd never let it get
that far. But it did. Because like David, porn is the first step on a
path that takes us away from God.

Have you ever heard of an athlete visualizing themselves winning? It's a
common practice for elite athletes to visualize all of the right moves
they need to make in order to win: running backs visualize their runs,
baseball players visualize themselves watching the ball all the way to
the bat and their perfect swing. Even pilots in pilot training practice
"chair flying" where they visualize themselves making a perfect landing
or executing a particularly difficult flight maneuver (can confirm
personally). These techniques are actually based on modern brain
science. Turns out, there is a part of our brain which can't distinguish
between fantasy and reality. Our brain then copies the behavior as if it
were actually happening, and reacts
accordingly.[\[1\]](#XlNJv){#cite-XlNJv .citation_link}

It also turns out, that's why porn works. When we watch porn, even
though we know it's fake, there's another part of our brain which is
processing it as if it is reality. That false reality will create a
chemical response which will induce a stronger desire to repeat the
experience. It's a function of our brain's "pleasure center." In other
words, *viewing the activity makes us more strongly want to do the
activity.*

Turns out that Jesus was right: what begins in the mind will eventually
be expressed in the body and the choices we make.

This is why watching porn is so sinful: it sends us down a wrong path
for our lives, a path that God did not intend for us. Watching porn
misses the mark for what God desires. Watching porn threatens the bond
to one spouse for a lifetime that God gave us, because it causes our
brain to unintentionally desire sex with another.

**But there is hope.**

The brain can change. The heart can be transformed. But it takes time
and effort to break the grip of porn on our lives. It usually requires
the help of a supportive recovery group to mentor you through the
process. If you are interested in seeking such recovery, reach out to
