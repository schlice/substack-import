**A stolen vehicle is found in A's premises, but there is no evidence
that A had any knowledge that the vehicle was a stolen property. Is A
guilty?**

So it sounds like A knew the vehicle was on his premises for some
reason, but was unaware that the vehicle was stolen.

The investigators would focus on how the vehicle came to be present on
A's premises.
