We've already spent billions of dollars in Ukraine with no strings
attached. We're not going to continue funding an unwinnable war.

What does that mean, *unwinnable*? Let's be honest. What's Zelenskyy's
end game here? Is he going to overthrow Russia? Does he think that he
can completely force Russia out of Ukraine and ignore Russia's claim on
the territory? The Donbas region has been *actively* disputed between
the two countries for at least ten years, but has been *actually*
disputed for much longer. Who gets it? Who are we to determine who gets
it? Ukraine says they won't sign any peace deal that cedes any territory
to Russia. At some point, compromise is going to have to be reached. And
peace deals necessarily involve compromise. That means that no one will
be 100% happy. That's the very nature of compromise.

Trump has been trying to bring both sides to the table to negotiate a
peace deal. But if both sides are going to be intransigent, then nothing
is going to be accomplished. Zelenskyy is going to have to realize that
he's going to have to give up something in order to end this war. Russia
will have to realize that annexing all of Ukraine is off the table. And
our America First president isn't going to enforce any deals unless
America is repaid for the billions we wasted funding an unwinnable war.
