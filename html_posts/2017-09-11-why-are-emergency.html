Your understanding of learned irrelevance appears to be flawed.

In rat models, when a tone and a shock were repeatedly administered, the
rat developed a learned irrelevance to anything other than a tone and a
shock. The rat was less able to develop a light-then-shock association
because of the learned irrelevance.

This does not directly correlate to the inability to use recalled data
in the event of an emergency. Simply seeing a sign repeatedly does not
make the sign irrelevant. This is not the definition of learned
irrelevance. Learned irrelevance related to the correlation of a
predicted and predictor stimuli, not a single stimulus over time.
