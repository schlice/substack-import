**I heard that police have scanners that automatically pick up and run
license plates, is this true?**

I've answered this question once before, but I can't seem to find my
answer right now.

The short answer is yes, they do.

There is a very thorough article on Automated License Plate Readers
(ALPR) over at the Electronic Frontier Foundation website:

[[Automated License Plate Readers
(ALPRs)](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cf92ed&url=https://www.eff.org/pages/automated-license-plate-readers-alpr){.external_link

Some are stationary, and others are mounted on police cars.

**\*\*Is it possible to hide from their system? Or can you change
plates?**

(This bit was added)

No, this is illegal. Any treatment or covering you add to a plate to
obscure it from any automated systems is illegal, just as it is illegal
to drive with incorrect number plates.
