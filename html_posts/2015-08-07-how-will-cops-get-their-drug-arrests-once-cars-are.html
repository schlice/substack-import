**Content:** [Thanks for the A2A, and great question.\
\
Two things:\
1. \"most dope busts follow random vehicular felony stops\" is not
necessarily an accurate depiction of most dope busts, as it were.
Vehicular drug enforcement is accomplished through several measures, one
of which is random stops. In many circumstances, police know who they
are looking for, and they stop the appropriate vehicle with the
appropriate occupants in the appropriate area.\
\
2. Self-driving cars must still have a licensed driver in them, and
driver override of an automated system is always possible. So police can
approach and light up an auto-drive car, and the driver will be required
to take over and stop the car.]{.rendered_qtext}
