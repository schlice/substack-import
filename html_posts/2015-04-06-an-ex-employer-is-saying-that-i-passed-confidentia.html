**Content:** [Even though th s is a specific question, I was A2A so I
will answer the general legal question \"if someone accuses me of X,
don\'t they have to prove it in order to convict me?\"\
\
Short answer: yes.\
\
Longer answer: under the U.S. Legal system, you are \"innocent until
proven guilty in a court of law.\" The burden of evidence is on the
prosecution to show \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" that you did it. The
defense is charged with casting light on reasonable doubt, showing the
jury the items which introduce reasonable doubt.\
\
So unless someone is filing a lawsuit against you, there is nothing for
you to do. I would make sure you are aware of a good corporate defense
attorney in your area and have the ability to retain that person, so
make sure you have the finances in order to pay the retainer, should you
get sued.]{.rendered_qtext}
