Here is my best suggestion, since smoke inhalation is one of those
scenarios which causes many injuries on commercial airliners:

This hood filters toxic smoke for up to 20 minutes and is under US\$70.
Buy this and keep it in your carry-on bag. Put the hood on and get
yourself off the plane. At least you won't be overcome by the smoke,
which is the bigger danger.
