You can't just *pass a law* and make guns illegal. Any such law would be
unconstitutional.

You have to start by repealing most of the Bill of Rights first,
primarily the Second, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments.

*Then* you could pass a law.

But *then* you'd have to find someone crazy or stupid enough to try to
enforce that law. Good luck there.

This would clearly be the start of the next Revolution.
