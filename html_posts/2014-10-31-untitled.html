<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [You mean how effective will it be to throw yourself onto
the grenade? Very. You reduce the number of casualties dramatically, and
if you are lucky, you might survive it yourself. You\'ll be ripped up
pretty badly (if you get your helmet onto the grenade, you can capture
most of the shrapnel and only your extremities will be seriously
damaged), but you might survive. Your buddies will definitely survive,
the fight can continue, and the mission can be
completed.]{.rendered_qtext}
