<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [You mean how effective will it be to throw yourself onto<br>the grenade? Very. You reduce the number of casualties dramatically, and<br>if you are lucky, you might survive it yourself. You\'ll be ripped up<br>pretty badly (if you get your helmet onto the grenade, you can capture<br>most of the shrapnel and only your extremities will be seriously<br>damaged), but you might survive. Your buddies will definitely survive,<br>the fight can continue, and the mission can be<br>completed.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-thing-to-do-when-a-grenade-is-thrown-at-you/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
