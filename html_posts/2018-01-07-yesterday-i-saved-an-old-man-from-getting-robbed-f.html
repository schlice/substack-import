Just to add to what everyone has already said, Mark Twain once said,
"Courage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear, not absence of fear."

Being brave doesn\'t mean having no fear. Being brave means respecting,
controlling, and using your fear to make you stronger.

You acted in spite of your fear, and that makes you courageous. Well
done.
