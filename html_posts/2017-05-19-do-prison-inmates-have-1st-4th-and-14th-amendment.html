Let's go through these one at a time, and understand that these are
different in every state:

- 1st Amendment: While inmates retain this right, it is most definitely
  restricted. Prisons generally restrict certain religious practices,
  they don't restrict religious belief. For example, some things may be
  restricted due to safety in the prison population, such as wearing
  certain religious symbols, dietary restrictions, and other practices
  which might cause a safety concern in a prison. Prisoners' speech
  rights are most often called into question when it comes to sending or
  receiving mail, and who and when prisoners can communicate or meet
  with. In general, if the prison can show a safety concern served by
  the restriction, the prison gets deference.
- The 4th Amendment is the one which is probably the most restricted,
  both in prison and on parole. Prisoners can most definitely be
  searched, physically as well as in their cells, at any time of the day
  or night, or in any way which the prison or PO feels is necessary to
  promote safety or to ensure the parolee remains in compliance with the
  details of their sentence. This is an overriding concern in prisons,
  and searching prisoners for contraband is part of that safety
  protocol.
- However, the courts have found that prisoners do have 14th Amendment
  rights, most notably the Equal Protection clause. They are protected
  against unequal treatment based on race, color, creed, sex, or
  national origin.
