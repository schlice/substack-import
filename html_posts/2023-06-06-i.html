For the benefit of others who may read this thread, let's discuss what
the *unpardonable sin* is.

In Mark 3:28, Jesus says, "Truly I tell you, people can be forgiven all
their sins and every slander they utter." But then, He adds one
exception: "Whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be
forgiven; they are guilty of an eternal sin" (v29).

According to Jesus, the *unpardonable sin* is a unique sin, one which
can only be done by blaspheming the Holy Spirit, but doing so in the
context of the Spirit's work in the world directly through the person of
Jesus.

The people who committed this sin were a group of Pharisees who accused
Jesus, while He was present on earth, of being possessed by Beelzebul.

> But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, "It is only by Beelzebul,
> the prince of demons, that this man casts out demons." --- Matthew
> 12:24 ESV

These Pharisees ***knew*** that Jesus was the Messiah. They knew that He
was sent by God. They saw the miracles with their own eyes. They heard
His words, directly from His own mouth. And yet, while knowing all of
this, they *intentionally attributed those acts to Satan instead of to
God.* They intentionally slandered the Holy Spirit, visibly acting
through God's own Son.

*That* was the unpardonable sin.

As you may have noticed, Jesus is not currently on the earth performing
miracles. Therefore, no one can attribute the direct actions of the Holy
Spirit, which they personally witness, through the person of Jesus, to
Satan, thus no one can commit this unpardonable sin.

Today, the only sin which is "unpardonable" would be *to die without
faith in Christ*. There can be no forgiveness for someone who dies
without faith in Christ.

You've been praying for a sign that you haven't committed the
unpardonable sin. The simple fact that you are actually praying to God
and asking for forgiveness means that there is a good chance you have
faith in Christ. Therefore, as Mark 3:28 says, people can be forgiven of
all of their sins and every slander they utter.

Ask, and you shall receive. Knock, and the door will be opened for you.
Seek, and you shall find. If you are seeking, you *will* find. If you
are asking, you *will* receive. Take comfort in that truth. The only
person who is not pardonable is the person who affirmatively,
intentionally rejects Christ, because there is no other avenue for
salvation other than through Christ.
