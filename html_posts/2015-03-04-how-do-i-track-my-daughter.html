**Content:** [There are many apps that do this, but the sending phone
has to have a data connection to transmit its information. There
arent\'t any tracking apps that I know of that currently use SMS to send
the location data of the phone, so that might be something useful. It
would be a true emergency phone locator when the phone doesn\'t have
data coverage but does have a cellular signal (and presumably a GPS
signal).\
\
Here\'s the basic idea: you pre-install the app on both the tracker and
the tracked phones. The app has to have SMS privileges on the phone, so
it may be a little tricky to do on iPhone without jailbreaking, but
Android is absolutely possible. The trick is hooking the app into SMS so
that the tracked phone can monitor SMS for a specially-coded message
that says \"activate.\"\
\
The app on the tracked phone intercepts the SMS \"activate\" message and
its tracking portion activates. It will then send an SMS to the tracker
every minute with its GPS coordinates until the battery dies or the app
receives a \"deactivate\" message over SMS.\
\
The app on the tracker phone will intercept the SMS and use the GPS
coordinates to plot the location on a map.]{.rendered_qtext}
