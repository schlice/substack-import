is right on the money. In every jurisdiction that I know of, you are
required by law to identify yourself to the police officer. That means
you are not allowed to give a false name when you are asked. You have to
give them at the very least your real name. You can\'t lie about that,
or you can be arrested for just that crime alone. You don\'t have to
answer any other questions if you don\'t want to, but remember that
making the police officer\'s job harder will just make your life harder
too, and will determine whether you walk home or whether your parents
pick you up from the police station. Remember, he\'s trying to determine
whether or not you\'re a minor. He still has a job to do.\
\
For the question, you said \"thinking you are a minor,\" so I\'m
assuming you are not. I would think you would want to exculpate yourself
as quickly as possible, so I\'d show the officer some form of
identification to prove I am not a minor. Officer comes back, says have
a nice night, and away you go.\

You only have to show identification (i.e. a driver\'s license) if you
are driving a car.]{.rendered_qtext}
