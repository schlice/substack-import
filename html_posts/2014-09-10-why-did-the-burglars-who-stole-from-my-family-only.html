<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *Question Details:*<br>><br>> *My family and I have been recently burglarized and I thought it was<br>> surprising they did not steal any technology (laptops, television set)<br>> nor did they steal any jewelry. They did manage to get away with some<br>> cash and a briefcase filled with important documents such as birth<br>> certificates, social security cards, blank checks etc. A couple of<br>> questions I have are: What can they do with that information? How can<br>> I retrieve these important documents back?*<br><br>I answer from experience; I was the victim of credit card fraud, so I am<br>thoroughly intimate with this process, more so than I ever wanted to be.<br><br>[[Andy<br>McGee](https://www.quora.com/profile/Andy-McGee)]{.qlink_container} hit<br>the nail on the head, thanks for your contribution Andy. They don\'t<br>actually want your things, they want money for your things, so they have<br>to convert your things into money. And your identity is much much more<br>valuable than the paper it is printed on, and much easier to convert to<br>money than physical items.<br><br>Identity theft is the fastest growing crime in the world. It is<br>immensely profitable and is very hard to catch an identity thief. It is<br>the Internet that has made identity theft so popular, so easy, and so<br>profitable. A good identity thief can steal your documents and make<br>thousands of dollars on their sale to those who will use them to open<br>credit cards, perpetrate bank takeover fraud, and do a hundred other<br>things, as you, and you\'ll incur thousands of dollars worth of debt<br>before you can blink an eye. Just look at all of the thefts from major<br>retailers of credit card transaction information: Hobby Lobby, Target,<br>and most recently The Home Depot are some of the largest thefts in<br>recent months.<br><br>These days, these things are FAR more valuable than physical items like<br>TVs or laptops. Items have to be sold, and it\'s a lot harder to sell<br>these things at a pawn shop than it used to be. Law enforcement works<br>closely with the pawn shops and police looking for stolen items will<br>know if they are pawned almost as soon as the sale is complete.<br><br>***This is important: You have to move quickly to protect your credit<br>from damage that will take a very, very long time to correct.***<br>Therefore, if you haven\'t done so already:<br><br>1\. Contact all three major credit bureaus<br>([Experian(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a3cf12&url=http://www.experian.com){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="experian.com"}]{.qlink_container},<br>[Equifax(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=72c490&url=http://www.equifax.com){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="equifax.com"}]{.qlink_container} , and [[Trans<br>Union](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e9ce70&url=http://www.transunion.com){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="transunion.com"}]{.qlink_container}). Complete the process<br>of identifying on your credit that you are the victim of identity theft.<br>They will put a *fraud alert* on your credit report and prospective<br>creditors will contact you before anyone has the opportunity to open up<br>accounts in your name, using your identity. **THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT!<br>THIS NEEDS TO BE DONE RIGHT AWAY!** The reason you have to act quickly<br>is that identity thieves can strike within hours of stealing your<br>information, and it can take years to recover your credit. Do not<br>hesitate, do this immediately!<br><br>You can also put a *credit freeze* on your credit, which means that<br>you can\'t use credit at all. This is a fairly drastic step, but it<br>may be worth it until you can get your affairs in order. You can remove<br>the credit freeze with a PIN that you establish when you place the<br>freeze.<br><br>In addition, you should obtain copies of your credit reports (you can<br>get them for free if you were the victim of identity theft). Check them<br>carefully and contact any entities with which you did not do business.<br><br>2\. You mentioned that blank checks were stolen. Contact that bank and<br>work with them. If you can identify the range of check numbers that was<br>taken, you can re-issue checks with a completely different range (for<br>example, if checks 100-375 were stolen, you can get new checks with<br>check numbers starting at 1000, and anything coming in with a check<br>number lower than that will be bounced). Worst case, the bank can close<br>your old account and move your assets to a completely new account<br>number.<br><br>3\. Birth Certificates: You will have to get the state in which you were<br>born to re-issue you copies of your birth certificates. Notarized copies<br>are as valid as real birth certificates, but you will have to have them<br>re-issued. Check the State website for the state in which you were born<br>to find out how to get new copies of your birth certificates.<br><br>4\. Social Security Cards: These will need to be re-issued by the Social<br>Security Administration. You will have to have the SSA re-issue your<br>Social Security cards.<br><br>5\. Finally, enroll in a credit monitoring service. LifeLock is one, but<br>there are others. The credit bureaus offer their own services. My<br>employer offers one for its employees. This is part of the \"layered<br>security\" you need to put in place on your credit, along with your<br>fraud alerts you placed in step 1. That step will be the biggest<br>deterrent, but this one is also important as you will know when the<br>illicit activity is happening. The police may also want to know as part<br>of their investigations, so along with the fraud alerts and the credit<br>bureaus contacting you when someone is trying to use your credit, credit<br>monitoring services will also be helpful when someone is simply<br>\"looking you up\" to see what your credit looks like.<br><br>Good luck.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
