I answer from experience; I was the victim of credit card fraud, so I am
thoroughly intimate with this process, more so than I ever wanted to be.

[[Andy
McGee](https://www.quora.com/profile/Andy-McGee)]{.qlink_container} hit
the nail on the head, thanks for your contribution Andy. They don\'t
actually want your things, they want money for your things, so they have
to convert your things into money. And your identity is much much more
valuable than the paper it is printed on, and much easier to convert to
money than physical items.

Identity theft is the fastest growing crime in the world. It is
immensely profitable and is very hard to catch an identity thief. It is
the Internet that has made identity theft so popular, so easy, and so
profitable. A good identity thief can steal your documents and make
thousands of dollars on their sale to those who will use them to open
credit cards, perpetrate bank takeover fraud, and do a hundred other
things, as you, and you\'ll incur thousands of dollars worth of debt
before you can blink an eye. Just look at all of the thefts from major
retailers of credit card transaction information: Hobby Lobby, Target,
and most recently The Home Depot are some of the largest thefts in
recent months.

These days, these things are FAR more valuable than physical items like
TVs or laptops. Items have to be sold, and it\'s a lot harder to sell
these things at a pawn shop than it used to be. Law enforcement works
closely with the pawn shops and police looking for stolen items will
know if they are pawned almost as soon as the sale is complete.

***This is important: You have to move quickly to protect your credit
from damage that will take a very, very long time to correct.***
Therefore, if you haven\'t done so already:

1\. Contact all three major credit bureaus
([[Experian](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a3cf12&url=http://www.experian.com){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="experian.com"}]{.qlink_container},
[[Equifax](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=72c490&url=http://www.equifax.com){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="equifax.com"}]{.qlink_container} , and [[Trans
Union](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e9ce70&url=http://www.transunion.com){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="transunion.com"}]{.qlink_container}). Complete the process
of identifying on your credit that you are the victim of identity theft.
They will put a ***fraud alert*** on your credit report and prospective
creditors will contact you before anyone has the opportunity to open up
accounts in your name, using your identity. **THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT!
THIS NEEDS TO BE DONE RIGHT AWAY!** The reason you have to act quickly
is that identity thieves can strike within **hours** of stealing your
information, and it can take **years** to recover your credit. Do not
hesitate, do this immediately!

You can also put a ***credit freeze*** on your credit, which means that
you can\'t use credit **at all**. This is a fairly drastic step, but it
may be worth it until you can get your affairs in order. You can remove
the credit freeze with a PIN that you establish when you place the
freeze.

In addition, you should obtain copies of your credit reports (you can
get them for free if you were the victim of identity theft). Check them
carefully and contact any entities with which you did not do business.

2\. You mentioned that blank checks were stolen. Contact that bank and
work with them. If you can identify the range of check numbers that was
taken, you can re-issue checks with a completely different range (for
example, if checks 100-375 were stolen, you can get new checks with
check numbers starting at 1000, and anything coming in with a check
number lower than that will be bounced). Worst case, the bank can close
your old account and move your assets to a completely new account
number.

3\. Birth Certificates: You will have to get the state in which you were
born to re-issue you copies of your birth certificates. Notarized copies
are as valid as real birth certificates, but you will have to have them
re-issued. Check the State website for the state in which you were born
to find out how to get new copies of your birth certificates.

4\. Social Security Cards: These will need to be re-issued by the Social
Security Administration. You will have to have the SSA re-issue your
Social Security cards.

5\. Finally, enroll in a credit monitoring service. LifeLock is one, but
there are others. The credit bureaus offer their own services. My
employer offers one for its employees. This is part of the \"layered
security\" you need to put in place on your credit, along with your
fraud alerts you placed in step 1. That step will be the biggest
deterrent, but this one is also important as you will know when the
illicit activity is happening. The police may also want to know as part
of their investigations, so along with the fraud alerts and the credit
bureaus contacting you when someone is trying to use your credit, credit
monitoring services will also be helpful when someone is simply
\"looking you up\" to see what your credit looks like.

Good luck.
