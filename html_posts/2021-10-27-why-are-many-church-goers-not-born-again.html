First off, you must define your terms. What precisely do you mean by
"born again?"

Most Christians understand this in relation to Jesus' discussion with
Nicodemus in John 3:

> Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the
> Jews; this man came to Jesus by night and said to Him, "Rabbi, we know
> that You have come from God *as* a teacher; for no one can do these
> signs that You do unless God is with him." Jesus answered and said to
> him, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot
> see the kingdom of God."

> Nicodemus said to Him, "How can a man be born when he is old? He
> cannot enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born, can
> he?" Jesus answered, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born
> of water and the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. "That
> which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the
> Spirit is spirit. "Do not be amazed that I said to you, 'You must be
> born again.' "The wind blows where it wishes and you hear the sound of
> it, but do not know where it comes from and where it is going; so is
> everyone who is born of the Spirit." --- John 3:1--8 NASB

So what does it mean to be "born again?" To most Christians, this is the
process of salvation through repentance and belief in Jesus.

So that begs the question: ***are most churchgoers saved?***

Well, you might think, why not? I mean, it's so simple to declare that
you repent of your sins and you believe that Jesus died for your sins.
Shouldn't everyone just, I dunno, *say those words?*

Well, it's harder to do than just speaking those words. You actually
must *repent* of your sins. Repenting means "turning away" from your
sins. It means recognizing your past and owning up to it, so that you
can conclusively, affirmatively say that you reject such a lifestyle.
And introspection is not something that many people do easily. Owning up
to one's past mistakes is not an easy thing to do. In some cases, people
may not even really be ready to turn away from their past life. Maybe
they feel like it's not sinful. Maybe they love the sin more than they
love God. And that's a tough conversation to have with yourself.

And what about believing that Jesus died for your sins? Isn't that easy
enough to believe? Not so fast. Because it's more than just believing
that Jesus died for you. You have to let Jesus be your personal savior.
You have to be ready to give your life to him to use as he wants. And
giving up control of your life is a *really hard* thing to do. People
really want to be the ones to forge their own destiny. They want to be
in charge. No one tells them what to do with their life, right? So this
is also very difficult.

So it should come as little surprise that the majority of people who
fill seats in church, every week, are *not saved*.
