**What would happen if the Second Amendment to the US Constitution were
repealed?**

*Within the first week:* nothing. Nothing at all will change. The Second
Amendment prevents the government from passing laws which infringe on
the right of the people to keep and bear arms.

*Within the first month:* Congress will pass the first law which makes
possession of all AR-15 style rifles illegal. But because they didn't
repeal the 4th Amendment, they still need search warrants to find them,
so they would be relying on people to voluntarily turn them in. And
because they didn't repeal the 5th Amendment, they have to provide "just
compensation" (read: fair market value) for any that are seized. And
because their method of accounting will no doubt not be "just," every
person who turns in an AR-15 will sue the government claiming a 5th
Amendment violation.

Also, the Supreme Court will hear its first case of the new law
violating a State constitution (as 44 state constitutions have a 2nd
Amendment), and we will get to see just how far the Supremacy Clause can
be pushed when it comes to a Federal *law* which is counter to a state
*constitution* when there is no Federal Constitutional authority to ban
guns. The Supremacy Clause says that the Constitution, and any Federal
laws which flow from it, are the supreme law of the land and even
override state constitutions (such as when the Voting Rights Act
overrode state constitutions when it enforced the 15th Amendment). But
this law does not flow from the Constitution; there is no Constitutional
authority which allows the Federal government to ban guns.

Some states will completely ban guns within their borders because they
now can (New York, California, and DC will likely be first up). They
will purport to show everyone just how "safe" life can be with no guns,
conveniently downplaying the continuing murders committed with guns.
"But those are *illegal* guns," they'll say.

*Within the first six months:* At least one state (possibly two) will
realize that if the Bill of Rights is no longer inviolate, then the
Federal government doesn't really care about protecting the rights of
states, and maybe this whole idea of a "union" is no longer workable,
and you'll see at least one attempt (and possibly one succeeding) of a
state to secede. Since the state agreed to the Constitution with a Bill
of Rights attached, the Constitution as it currently stands is not what
the state agreed to, and so (they will argue) they can leave the union.

Also, the Federal government will realize that as hard as they try, they
can't seem to collect a whole lot of AR-15 style rifles, because not
only do they not know where they are, but the people they "think" might
have them have conveniently lost them in many mysterious boating
accidents.

This is just one possible scenario. There are a hundred others. Who
knows exactly how it would turn out, but what we do know is that no law
will stop a bad person from committing a crime.
