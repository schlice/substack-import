Stanford traditionally ranks higher than USAFA as an engineering school.

But if you're comparing the two schools and trying to figure out which
would be a better choice ***if you want to be a computer engineer,***
then the correct answer is **not a military academy.**

***You go to a military academy to become a military officer.*** You are
an officer first, and a career second.

That doesn't mean that USAFA is a bad engineering school. Far from it.

But I return to my original point. If you want to be a computer
engineer, go to any college except for a military academy. If you want
to be a military officer, go to a military academy.
