**How can witnesses simply refuse to comply with a congressional
subpoena without consequences?**

There are always consequences. But it sounds like you might be thinking
of "getting arrested" as if a Congressional subpoena is equal in power
to a judge's court subpoena.

News flash: those are two different branches of government.

In this specific case, you have to remember one very important point:
**we have three co-equal branches of government.**

The Congress has no direct authority over the White House or the Courts.
Similarly, the White House has no direct authority over the Congress or
the courts, and vice versa for the courts. Each branch of government is
co-equal.

Congress does have investigative authority, in order to properly perform
its legislative function. It has to ensure that laws are working in
accordance with the way they were written. To that end, they can
subpoena information and testimony as needed to fulfill that oversight
function. They can also vote to open an impeachment inquiry and subpoena
witnesses and testimony to further that investigation.

But they're not the police, and they are not judges.

The White House, if it believes that the content or witness being
subpoenaed is protected by executive privilege, has an *obligation* to
refuse to comply with the subpoena. Congress has no authority over the
Executive, and if the information is truly protected by executive
privilege, it must be defended from release.

And if the Congress insists that executive privilege should not attach,
it can petition the court to intervene. Each side would get an equal
chance to plead their case, and the court would decide whose authority
should prevail in this particular instance. They would also decide if
the subpoena was valid and whether or not it can be enforced.

If a court were to decide such a thing, the Congress could then take
their subpoena to a US Attorney, who would hand it over to the FBI or
the US Marshall Service to enforce.
