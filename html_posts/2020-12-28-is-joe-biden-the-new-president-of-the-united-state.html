**Is Joe Biden the legal President or not?**

Not yet. That won't happen until January 20th, when he will be sworn in
as President.

Today, he is what we call "President-elect." This is not an office or an
actual title, it's just the way we refer to him since he isn't President
yet, but he has been elected President. Trump continues to serve as
President until the swearing-in ceremony, at which time Biden becomes
President.
