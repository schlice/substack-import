**Are there any proven strategies to lower the risk of cognitive
dysfunction in those with MS?**

The short answer is no. There are no proven strategies to lower risk of
cognitive dysfunction in those with MS.

Cognitive dysfunction is one of the most common symptoms of MS; over 50%
of patients have reported some cognitive change. With some, it was their
first symptom.

Some points about cognitive dysfunction in MS:

- Changes can occur at any time --- even as a first symptom of MS ---
  but are more common later in the disease.
- Cognitive function correlates with number of lesions and lesion area
  on MRI, as well as brain atrophy.
- Cognitive dysfunction can occur with any disease course, but is
  slightly more likely in progressive MS.
- You are more likely to experience cognitive dysfunction (the first
  signs or new changes) during an exacerbation.
- Cognitive changes generally progress slowly. They are unlikely to
  improve dramatically once they have begun.[\[1\]](#aOIuy){#cite-aOIuy

Cognitive changes do not correlate well to other symptoms. Someone who
has many physical changes may have no cognitive decline at all, while
someone who is relatively healthy physically may have significant
cognitive impairment.

Most of the research today focuses on treatment of cognitive dysfunction
rather than avoidance. Since cognitive dysfunction is a function of
number of lesions and brain atrophy, using the existing disease
modifying drugs to limit the number of lesions and limit atrophy should
also help to stabilize cognitive changes. Research into this area is
ongoing.
