**How can I stop law enforcement from constantly assaulting me with
energy weapons? There are no long term studies on the effects of radar
effects on the body?**

Clever! Here's another way to try to stop law enforcement from doing
their jobs:

*Law enforcement can't use radar on my car because it's not using radar
to track my speed, it's "assault with an energy weapon."*

First of all, RADAR is not an "energy weapon." It's a traffic control
device. It is specifically designed to emit such a low level of
radiation that it blends in with the natural radiation in the
environment.

Secondly, and this ties in to that last sentence, you receive RF
radiation from a variety of sources, every single day:

- Outer space and the sun
- The sky -- including lightning strikes
- The earth itself -- most radiation from the earth is infrared, but a
  tiny fraction is RF

Man-made RF radiation is used for many different things, such as

- Broadcasting radio and television signals
- Transmitting signals from cordless telephones, cell phones and cell
  phone towers, satellite phones, and 2-way radios
- WiFi and Bluetooth
- Cooking food (in a microwave oven)
- Heating body tissues to destroy them in medical procedures
- "Welding" pieces of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) using certain machines
- Millimeter wave scanners at the airport[\[1\]](#idLED){#cite-idLED

And, of course, police radar.

The World Health Organization says the following regarding exposure to
radio frequency energy and risk of cancer:

To answer the specific question about police radar, as I mentioned, the
average output power emitted is very low (a few milliwatts), and so they
are not considered hazardous to health, even when used in very close
proximity to the body. You get larger doses of radiation from everyday
objects, the universe, and your cell phone than you do from police
radar.

**TL;DR**: You can try to get the police to stop using RADAR by claiming
that it is an "energy weapon" and that no one really knows the long-term
effect of being blasted by those energy weapons inside your car, but
science knows better.

I must say though, it's pretty clever. Good for you. Better idea though:
just drive the speed limit.
