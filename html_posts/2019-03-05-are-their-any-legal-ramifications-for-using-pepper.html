**Are their any legal ramifications for using pepper spray on someone?**

Of course there are! However, most of the time that pepper spray is used
on someone (which constitutes a simple assault), you have an
*affirmative defense.* An affirmative defense is one in which you
*affirm* that you committed the offense, but you did so because of a
generally accepted reason (i.e. you used pepper spray in self-defense).

If you were not using pepper spray to defend yourself, then you could be
seen as an aggressor and you could be charged with assault.
