Your view is perfectly okay! This is the biblical order of marriage and
family, ordained by God, based on the way that women and men were
designed, and there is nothing wrong with holding that view.

But it is perfectly acceptable to hold the opposite view as well, that
it is okay for women to be CEOs and climb the corporate ladder. It's not
*biblical,* but it's not *wrong*. God gave us free will, and we can use
that free will to either follow Him or reject Him.

Both views are perfectly okay **for any one person to hold.**

\

What is ***NOT*** okay is to *malign* the person who holds the opposite
view.

I'm certainly not accusing you of doing this; you did not. You simply
said that not all women want to be feminists. You're right. You said
that you believe the man to be the head of the household. That's a
perfectly acceptable belief.

**But the feminists want to tell you that** ***you are wrong for holding
such a belief.***

The feminists want to tell you that holding to the Biblical
understanding of how to build a household in a Godly manner is **wrong**
and must be rejected. **THIS** is what is not okay. This view that your
opinion carries less weight because you have an opinion of how you wish
to run your own life.

Similarly, it would not be okay to tell a feminist that she is wrong by
wanting to be a CEO or lead a nation. She is perfectly free to hold that
view.

There is a difference between what is *socially acceptable* and what is
*biblical*. ***Not everything that is socially acceptable is
biblical.***
