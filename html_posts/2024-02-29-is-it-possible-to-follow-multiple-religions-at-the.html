You can believe whatever you like! But the claim that all religions
believe in one God or that just because all religions contain *some*
truth that all religions *are* true is just pluralist nonsense that
appeals to the broadly tolerant American mind.

It might be tempting to think this. This appeals to our progressive
multicultural world, doesn't it? We don't like the thought of only one
religion being true, because it would mean that billions of religious
people from every other religious faith are wrong today and have been
wrong throughout the centuries. And that's a big problem if Christianity
is true because Christianity seems to teach that non-Christians are
going to hell.

There's also the not-unfounded fear that those who think they have the
truth will be intolerant of those who won't accept it.

Easygoing Americans are more apt to believe that **no** religion has the
complete truth. This sentiment is often illustrated by the favorite
parable of many university professors: the parable of the six blind men
and the elephant. This is where each blind man feels a different part of
the elephant and therefore reaches a different conclusion about the
object in front of him. One grabs the tusk and says, "This is a spear!"
Another feels the trunk and says, "This is a snake!" The one hugging the
leg claims, "This is a tree!" The blind man holding the tail thinks, "I
have a rope!" The one feeling the ear believes, "This is a fan!" And the
one leaning on the elephant's side is certain, "This is a wall!" These
blind men are said to represent world religions because they each come
to a different conclusion about what they are sensing. Like each blind
man, we are told, no one religion has the truth. No one religion has the
complete answer. Religions are simply different paths up the same
mountain.

In America, truth in religion is considered an oxymoron. There is no
truth in religion, we are told. It's all a matter of taste or opinion.
You like chocolate, I like vanilla. You like Christianity, I like Islam.
If Buddhism works for you, then it's true for you. Besides, you ought
not judge me for my beliefs!

At first glance, it might appear that the existence of so many
contradictory beliefs just reinforces the elephant parable, namely that
truth in religion cannot be known. But exactly the opposite is the case.
The elephant parable may seem persuasive until you ask yourself one
question: "What's the perspective of the one telling the parable?" The
one telling the parable appears to have an objective perspective of the
entire proceeding because he can see that the blind men are mistaken.

And that's exactly correct. In fact, he wouldn't know that the blind men
were wrong unless he had an objective perspective of what was right! So
if the person telling the parable can have an objective perspective, why
can't the blind men? They could---if the blind men suddenly could see,
they too would realize that they were originally mistaken. That's really
an elephant in front of them and not a wall, fan, or rope.

We too can see the truth in religion. Unfortunately, many of us who deny
there's truth in religion are not *actually* blind but only *willfully*
blind. We may not want to admit that there's truth in religion because
that truth will convict us. But if we open our eyes and stop hiding
behind this self-defeating nonsense that truth cannot be known, then
we'll be able to see the truth as well. And not just truth in the areas
where we demand it---money, relationships, health, law, etc.---but truth
in religion as well. As the blind man healed by Jesus said, "Once I was
blind, but now I see."
