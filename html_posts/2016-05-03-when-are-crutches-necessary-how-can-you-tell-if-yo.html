Canes or crutches are necessary when you have at least one leg which
cannot support weight for whatever reason. They can help support your
weight while you walk if one of your legs does not.

If you try to stand up and you fall over because one of your legs will
not support your weight any more, or if you trip or fall frequently
because one of your legs is no longer supporting your weight adequately,
perhaps it\'s time to talk to your doctor about why this is happening.
