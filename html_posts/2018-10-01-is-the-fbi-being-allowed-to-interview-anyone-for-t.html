**Is the FBI being allowed to interview anyone for the Kavanaugh
investigation or is Trump and/or the Senate putting limits on it?**

The answer is yes and no.

When the original announcement was made regarding the new investigation,
the announcement simply said that it was going to be a "supplemental
background investigation, limited in scope and duration." We were told
that it was limited to this issue (not his entire childhood or all of
the other things that are reviewed during a background investigation)
and that the FBI would have a maximum of one week to accomplish it.

Beyond that, **no other limits have been placed on the FBI.** They can
feel free to question *anyone* in relation to this issue, but they are
limited to this sexual assault issue in this high school timeframe. So
if an interviewee says, "I don't know of Brett ever assaulting a woman
or attending a party with Dr. Ford, but boy was he a binge drinker and
he was the Beer Pong National Champion," they will most likely not
follow the path of "binge drinker," since is is only tangentially
related to the issue they are investigating. On the other hand, if an
interviewee says, under oath, "Brett got so drunk that I saw him fall
all over this one girl, but then the next day he couldn't even remember
that happening," they may start to proceed down that line of questioning
with others (i.e. he would get so drunk that he would assault women and
have no recollection of it), as it is directly related to allegations of
sexual assault.
