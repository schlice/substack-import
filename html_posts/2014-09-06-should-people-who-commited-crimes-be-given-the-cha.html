<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I have to agree with<br>[User-13562045611175348119(https://www.quora.com/profile/User-13562045611175348119)]{.qlink_container}\'s<br>answer. It is a privilege to serve in the military, and military service<br>should never be viewed as a punishment.\<br>\<br>However, the other posters are trying to make a valid point: the lessons<br>you learn in the military can take the unruly, undisciplined child and<br>give him enough of the \"straight and narrow\" to set him on a course<br>for lifelong success. So is there a way to have *both*?\<br>\<br>I say we look at following in the footsteps of the Swiss: compulsory<br>military service for two years following high school, for those who are<br>physically able-bodied. You learn many things while on military service:<br>how to handle a weapon safely, how to respect authority and work within<br>the system but still make the system work for you, and potentially learn<br>a trade or skill that you can apply to the rest of your life, and walk<br>out the door with two years of experience doing that trade. Or, quite<br>possibly, find that you absolutely thrive in such an environment and<br>decide to re-enlist and make the military a career.\<br>\<br>Yes, there will be plenty of people who do not do well in the military.<br>That\'s why it\'s only two years, and it\'s an entry-level position. You<br>still leave with two years of work experience, which means you\'re not<br>entry-level anymore. Even if the military is not right for you, you<br>still benefit.\<br>\<br>We benefit by providing the youth of our country with some discipline<br>and some job skills, making instant productive citizens who have been<br>exposed to the profession that preserves our way of life. They at least<br>learn the respect for that profession and what it takes to live in a<br>free society.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
