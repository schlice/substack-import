**Content:** [I have to agree with

answer. It is a privilege to serve in the military, and military service
should never be viewed as a punishment.\
\
However, the other posters are trying to make a valid point: the lessons
you learn in the military can take the unruly, undisciplined child and
give him enough of the \"straight and narrow\" to set him on a course
for lifelong success. So is there a way to have ***both***?\
\
I say we look at following in the footsteps of the Swiss: compulsory
military service for two years following high school, for those who are
physically able-bodied. You learn many things while on military service:
how to handle a weapon safely, how to respect authority and work within
the system but still make the system work for you, and potentially learn
a trade or skill that you can apply to the rest of your life, and walk
out the door with two years of experience doing that trade. Or, quite
possibly, find that you absolutely thrive in such an environment and
decide to re-enlist and make the military a career.\
\
Yes, there will be plenty of people who do not do well in the military.
That\'s why it\'s only two years, and it\'s an entry-level position. You
still leave with two years of work experience, which means you\'re not
entry-level anymore. Even if the military is not right for you, you
still benefit.\
\
We benefit by providing the youth of our country with some discipline
and some job skills, making instant productive citizens who have been
exposed to the profession that preserves our way of life. They at least
learn the respect for that profession and what it takes to live in a
free society.]{.rendered_qtext}
