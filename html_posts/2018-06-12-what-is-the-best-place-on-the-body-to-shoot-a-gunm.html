**What is the best place on the body to shoot a gunman, attempting a
home invasion, to simply disable him without creating a life-threatening
wound?**

Herein lies the problem.

You want to use **deadly force** and attempt to use it in a
**predictably less-than-lethal** capacity.

In most cases, this is not possible. Guns do not cause death every time
they are used, but they *can*. A shot in the leg can hit the femoral
artery and the person can bleed out before an ambulance can arrive. Any
wound with a firearm can be deadly. There is no place you can shoot
someone which is guaranteed to not cause death.

If you employ deadly force, it is because you have the right to do so.
You are in a situation which calls for deadly force (i.e. you are in
fear for your life or the life of someone else).

***Employing deadly force implies that someone may die.***

If you are not prepared to accept that fact, do not carry an implement
of deadly force on your person, and do not employ one.

There is also a legal complication: attempting to use deadly force in a
situation which did not call for the application of deadly force may
imply that you *did not* have the legal right to use deadly force, in
which case **you** become the aggressor employing more force than you
were allowed to employ, in which case you get arrested.

Let me say it again: ***employing deadly force implies that someone may
die.*** If you are not prepared for that (and you are not in a situation
which warrants the application of deadly force), do not carry deadly
force.
