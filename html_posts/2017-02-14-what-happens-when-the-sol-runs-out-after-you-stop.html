When the statute of limitations runs out, you can't file ***criminal***
charges against the doctor, and in many cases, you can't file a civil
action either.

You can, however, still ask the state licensing authority in the state
in which the doctor is licensed to review the situation and determine if
any remedial action should be taken. The doctor could still lose his
license.

Contact the state licensing authority for doctors and open a case.
