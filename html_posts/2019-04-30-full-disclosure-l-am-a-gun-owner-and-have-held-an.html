**Full disclosure: l am a gun owner and have held an AK-47, and fired an
AR-15. As a progressive, I have advocated closing the "gun show
loophole" to mandate universal background checks. Why have so many
Conservatives never even HEARD of that loophole?**

Because it doesn't exist.

Please allow me to explain.

There are only two types of people who sell guns: people who sell guns
for a living, and people who don't. Those categories are defined by
BATFE. If you fall into the former, you must obtain a Federal Firearms
License, and every person to whom you sell a gun must be run through
NICS (the National Instant Criminal Background Check System). If you
fall into the latter group, in the vast majority of states, you do not
need to do background checks. For example, I own "a few" guns but I
don't sell guns for a living. That doesn't mean I can't sell a gun I
own. If I do, I'm not required under Federal law to perform a background
check on the buyer.

Now my state may require me to do so (and Colorado does), but Federal
law does not.

This began with the Gun Control Act (GCA) of 1968, which said that
unlicensed sellers (i.e. private citizens) can only sell guns to people
who live in the same state, and who they reasonably believe are not a
prohibited person. It doesn't require that they do background checks.
The Firearms Owners Protection Act (FOPA) was passed in 1986, and helped
to clarify the GCA. The scope of those who \"engage in the business\" of
dealing in firearms (and are therefore required to have a license) was
narrowed to include only those who devote \"time, attention, and labor
to dealing in firearms as a regular course of trade or business with the
principal objective of livelihood and profit through the repetitive
purchase and resale of firearms.\" FOPA excluded those who buy and sell
firearms to \"enhance a personal collection\" or for a \"hobby,\" or who
\"sell all or part of a personal collection.\" The DOJ said that this
clarification was necessary to ensure the GCA did not \"place any undue
or unnecessary federal restrictions or burdens on law-abiding
citizens\[.\]"

While the vast majority of sellers at gun shows are actually dealers
(who must actually do background checks), there are always a few private
party sellers who come to sell their collection. These private party
sellers still don't have to do background checks, even if they are
selling at a gun show. Still others will bring personal firearms to a
gun show, leave them locked in their car, and watch for other attendees
to look at a dealer's gun, and then offer to sell their own private
firearm for less. The two then proceed out to the car and make the
transaction, with no background check needed, so long as the prospective
buyer wasn't background checked at the table and denied.

The moniker "gun show loophole" makes it appear that *every* sale at a
gun show is background check-free, and this simply isn't the case. It's
a sloppy name for a provision entered into the GCA to reduce the load on
the NICS system. Additionally, a "loophole" is when there is a provision
of the law that, while completely legal, produces a completely
unintended result. In this case, private sales not requiring background
checks is by no means a "loophole." It is an intentional feature added
to the law to not \"place any undue or unnecessary federal restrictions
or burdens on law-abiding citizens\[.\]"

In order to provide all private citizens access to NICS, it would have
to be completely redone, as its current implementation couldn't handle
the load, and it would pose that unnecessary burden on law-abiding
citizens. This would open it up to Constitutional challenges, and I
don\'t think lawmakers want to risk the whole thing being struck down as
unconstitutional.
