**How does the US southern border fit the definition of a National
Emergency, ie, a "situation beyond the ordinary which threatens the
health or safety of citizens and which cannot be properly addressed by
the use of other law"?**

While I can appreciate your attempt at a definition, there is no legal
standard by which the President must follow before declaring a national
emergency.

But the situation at the southern border most definitely fits what you
described:

- **A situation beyond the ordinary -** the situation at the Southern
  border, where people openly violate US law and enter the country
  illegally by the thousands every day is definitely beyond the ordinary
- **which threatens the health or safety of citizens -** there are
  several arguments which prove that illegal immigration threatens the
  health and safety of our citizens. Just ask Angel Families.
- **and which cannot be properly addressed by the use of other law -** I
  think it's fair to say that existing laws (i.e. funding for border
  construction through Congress' macchinations) are not adequate to
  address the immediate need at the border.

You can be sure that there will be both political and legal challenges
to this state of national emergency. It will be fascinating to see how
it all shakes out.
