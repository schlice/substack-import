**Content:** [You didn\'t say where the job was located. And if it\'s
located in the United States, that makes all the difference.\
\
The Americans with Disabilities Act says very clearly that employers
cannot discriminate against an employee because they have a disability.
But if this is true, then by the same token they absolutely cannot
discriminate against someone because they **don\'t** have a disability.\
\
Basically, the employer can state the requirements for the job, and if
the candidate meets the requirements, they can apply for the job.\
\
I suppose, if the employer chose to do so, he could create a position
that required a deaf person to apply. He\'d be severely limiting his job
pool, and I\'d have doubts as to whether or not such a position would be
legal (as it would be a type of reverse discrimination: legally you
can\'t require the position to be filled with someone who doesn\'t have
a disability, so you can\'t also require the position to be filled by
someone with a disability). But I suspect that employers would not
require the position to be filled by a deaf person.\
\
They can require that the person filling the job be able to communicate
in ASL fluently. They can test you on your ASL ability, and they can
take the candidate that \"speaks\" ASL the best. Whether you are deaf or
hearing is not relevant, unless it is (for example, you work with
equipment that has no capacity for visual signals, it only produces
audible signals, so the person operating it must be able to hear the
signals it produces. While this is unlikely, I\'m just putting it out
there showing when it would be acceptable for an employer to place a
hearing condition on a job).\
\
I can\'t speak to what the deaf community would think of a hearing
person taking a job that a deaf person can fill. But if I believe in the
legislation, a deaf person can fill any job, just as a hearing person
can.]{.rendered_qtext}
