As with all legal answers, the answer is "it depends."

In most cases, properly used sandbags will not place you into legal
jeopardy, but the operative word there is "properly." Sandbags should
only be used to protect your *structure*, so if they are going to be
used at all, you can only use them to keep the water out of your house.

But let's say you have *a lot* of sandbags. Couldn't you just use them
to keep floodwaters off of *your entire property?* In most cases, no you
cannot do this.

Assuming that you live in a neighborhood with other houses, the
*overland grading* performed when the house was built is designed to
move large amounts of water between and around properties effectively.
**If you modify this drainage plan**, either through landscaping *or
with the use of sandbags*, you could be liable for diverting that water
in such a way as to cause unintended amounts of water to trespass on to
your neighbor's property. Under the doctrine of *contributory
negligence,* you could then be liable for part of the repair bill for
your neighbor's property.
