**Content:** [I really don\'t think there are \"everyday felonies\"
committed by \"almost every American.\" There are felonies that are very
easy to commit, people do them all the time, and they\'re also not well
known. Here\'s a few examples:\
\
- You drive your ATV onto protected wilderness land (very easy for us in
Colorado to do). Even doing so accidentally, you have violated the
Federal Wilderness Act, which is a felony. Bobby Unser did this in 1997,
accidentally, during a blizzard. He was convicted anyway.\
\
- You \"call in sick\" to take a powder day (also common for us skiiers
in Colorado). If your company doesn\'t have a \"personal day\" provision
(mine has converted \"sick days\" to \"sick/personal days\" to avoid
this issue), you \"calling in sick\" can be considered a Federal felony
called \"Honest Services Fraud\": a \"scheme\" to defraud your company
of their \"intangible right\" to your \"honest service.\" Note that no
one has ever been convicted of this yet, but it is possible.\
\
- You find drugs in your kid\'s room (again, really likely for us in
Colorado). Instead of calling the police, you flush the drugs and elect
to deal with your kid yourself. But the police had opened an
investigation into your kid\'s underage Marijuana use yesterday. Since
you just destroyed evidence in an ongoing police investigation, you have
just committed the felony of \"obstructing justice.\"\
\
These are just a few felonies you could commit without even knowing you
were committing a felony. I agree that it\'s hard to unknowingly commit
a felony, but there are things that happen in every day life that could
be illegal.]{.rendered_qtext}
