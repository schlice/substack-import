**What are some human rights that aren't in the US Constitution but
should be?**

Let me take a crack at answering your question, because you got a lot of
answers explaining that the Constitution doesn't grant rights.

We know this.

You're asking whether or not there are any other natural, human rights
which are **not** listed as part of the recognized rights in the Bill of
Rights.

I think a not-wonderful-but-still-helpful method to accomplish this
would be to compare the Bill of Rights to the [[Universal Declaration of
Human Rights
(UDHR)](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9f101a&url=https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/){.external_link

We already know that this document is fraught with challenges. For
example, Article 25 begins with

> \(1\) Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the
> health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food,
> clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and
> the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness,
> disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in
> circumstances beyond his control.

While we certainly agree that everyone has the right to a certain
standard of living, it is not the place of the government to *provide*
that. The Declaration of Independence clarified that the purpose of
government was to *promote* the general welfare, not *provide* it.
Additionally, it is listed that everyone has a right to medical care. To
what degree? In the United States, anyone can walk into any emergency
room and receive treatment for emergency, life-threatening conditions,
regardless of ability to pay. But healthcare is a *service* provided by
others, who must also be compensated for their work. It is not provided
by indentured servants who must provide for your rights. And it is not
provided by government, as medical personnel in the United States are
not government employees funded by a single tax system. *And even if it
was,* it still wouldn't be a right, it would be a service funded by your
tax dollars.

While some of these items in the UDHR are things we *aspire* to provide,
some of them are outside of our ability to provide under our system of
government.

That aside, let's look at the UDHR and see if there are human rights
called out there which we do not address in the Bill of Rights. From
what I can see, besides the aforementioned right to healthcare, there is
one other:

> Article 6: Everyone has the right to recognition everywhere as a
> person before the law.

We have been kicking around the idea of a personhood amendment for a
long time. But we have run into a very significant question which has
caused us to not be able to move forward on this: *At what point in time
is a person a person?* This is significant because at the point when a
person becomes a person (and not a fetus), that person is endowed with
all of the rights and privileges of people in the United States,
including the right to life. Pre-persons in the United States are not
afforded the right to life: their mother can kill them at will. So we
haven't been able to adopt this just yet, because we still haven't
decided who is included in the "everyone" banner and at what point in
your human development you actually are recognized as a "person."
