**If someone was to use stealth technology on a car, would they be able
to outsmart the radar speed check?**

Mythbusters tested this. They found that radar absorbent material (RAM)
paint, which is very dense, would make the car far too heavy to be
practical, and is ridiculously expensive.

[[They tested a lot of other ways to beat
radar](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f4f5eb&url=https://mythresults.com/episode18){.external_link

didn't work.
