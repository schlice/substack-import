Violence is a subset of evil, and God didn't create evil.

*WAAH BUT GOD CREATED EVERYTHING!*

Yes but evil isn't a "thing" which can be created. Evil is a state of
disobedience to God's will. Evil is an absence of good. For example, we
all know that holes exist, but you can't "create" a hole. You make a
hole by removing dirt. So while a hole exists, it's not created. It's
just an absence of something else. You can't have a hole without
something else within which a hole exists.

Evil is the same way. Evil wasn't explicitly created. It was always a
possibility for creatures who have free will. The angels who have free
will also chose evil by disobeying God, and they were cast out of heaven
into the place especially created for them --- hell.

So all that was needed for evil to occur was to have a created being
with the capacity to choose to do good (by obeying God) or evil (by
disobeying God).

When Adam and Eve disobeyed God, committing the world's first sin, they
were cast out from the Garden, and they physically changed. They knew
the pain of childbirth. They knew sickness, disease, and ultimately
death, after they sinned and introduced sin into the world. We all live
in a fallen state because of that choice.

Violence is a result of evil, which is a result of us living in a fallen
world, in fallen bodies. God didn't create that because **He didn't have
to create it**. It's a natural consequence of choosing to disobey God
and thus living in a fallen world.
