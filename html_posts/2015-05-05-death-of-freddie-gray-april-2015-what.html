**Content:** [There is a very low chance that the officers will be
convicted of murder.\
\
Even knowing that their brutality \"was resulting in him becoming
mortally wounded or would result in his death\" does not rise to the
standard of murder. That might rise to the standard of \"voluntary
manslaughter\" but definitely does not rise to the standard of murder.
And if they are charged with murder, the only possible outcome is that
they will be acquitted.\
\
The problem in this case is the same as what happened in the Zimmerman
case in Florida: \"prosecutorial overreach.\" She jumped to charge the
officers with a charge that is far and above what she could reasonably
determine in such a short period of time. When prudence dictates that
the evidence be given more weight and more opportunity for review, she
did not do that. The reviews of the Michael Brown case took 108 days,
and the review of the Eric Garner case took 140 days. But Ms. Mosby can
determine in just a few hours that murder charges are warranted, and she
didn\'t even consult a grand jury? It\'s clear to even the casual
observer that the charges were ***politically*** motivated, not
***judicially*** motivated. That is a **travesty** and an absolute
*abdication* of her responsibilities of her office. I predict that if
she hasn\'t already been elected to Congress by the time this is all
over, she\'ll be fired as Baltimore City State\'s Attorney.\
\
She levied these charges to stop the riots. Our system of justice is not
based on appeasing the rioting crowds, it\'s based on law. Maybe there
are some other cultures in the world which use mob rule, but not this
country. This is a sad, sad day for the legal system. Because of her
overreach, not only will these officers likely go free, but it\'s also
likely that even if they were guilty of some lesser offense, they will
never be brought to justice.]{.rendered_qtext}
