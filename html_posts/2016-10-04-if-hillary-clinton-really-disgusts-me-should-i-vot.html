*(NOTE: I'm not going to tell you who to vote for. I'm just going to
give you my opinion about voting in general)*

I don't think it's correct to vote for someone because you don't like
the other guy (or gal). I most definitely believe that you should vote
for the candidate who most closely aligns with your beliefs about how
the country should be run. Who will provide you with the tax policy you
like the best? Whose policies will create the most jobs? Whose policies
will best improve the economy? Whose policies will lower your health
insurance premiums while still providing for the broadest possible
access to health insurance for everyone?

If you can't find a candidate who will do that for you, I would suggest
not voting. Don't vote for someone if they don't mirror your beliefs.

And don't fall for all this "it's your civic duty to vote" crap. The
majority of the country does not vote, and never has. Somehow, we've
managed to survive all this time without them; I suspect we will survive
another few years without them, too. It's your *right* to vote, it's not
a *requirement*.

Plus, you will have the competitive edge in any political argument:
"Hey, don't blame me, I didn't vote for him/her."
