The Bible isn't just one book, but a collection of 66 books, written
collectively over the course of 1500 years by no fewer than 40 authors
in three languages and on three different continents.

Nevertheless, with all of that diversity and length of time and
geographical space, there is **consistency** in the message of the
Bible. It tells the same story about how man had paradise, lost
paradise, and regained paradise, all through God's great plan for us.

Some things which make the Bible unique are *miracles.* Miracles are
sort of like the "stamp of authenticity." Miracles are things only God
can do which are outside of the ordinary. When God performs miracles, He
essentially authenticates what He says. Miracles are an act of God which
confirm the Word of God. The Bible is unique in this.

The other thing which makes the Bible unique, in my opinion, is
*prophesy.* Prophesy happens, usually, long before the actual event
happens, and then it happens as the prophet said. Peter Stoner wrote a
book called *Science Speaks* in which he calculated the probability of
multiple prophecies coming true in the life of one person. Remember,
there are over 130 prophecies in the Bible, some of which have not yet
been fulfilled, but of those that have, they have all come true in the
life of Jesus. Stoner calculated the probability of just 8 Messianic
prophecies being fulfilled in the life of Jesus. As you read through
these prophecies, you will see that all estimates were calculated as
conservatively as possible.

1.  The Messiah will be born in Bethlehem (Micah 5:2).\
    \
    The average population of Bethlehem from the time of Micah to the
    present (1958) divided by the average population of the earth during
    the same period = 7,150/2,000,000,000 or 2.8 x
    [\[math\]10\^5\[/math\]]{.render_latex}.
2.  A messenger will prepare the way for the Messiah (Malachi3:1).\
    \
    One man in how many, the world over, has had a forerunner (in this
    case, John the Baptist) to prepare his way? Estimate: 1 in 1,000 or
    1 x [\[math\]10\^3\[/math\]]{.render_latex}.
3.  The Messiah will enter Jerusalem as a king riding on a donkey
    (Zechariah 9:9).\
    \
    One man in how many, who has entered Jerusalem as a ruler, has
    entered riding on a donkey? Estimate: 1 in 100 or 1 x
    [\[math\]10\^2\[/math\]]{.render_latex}.
4.  The Messiah will be betrayed by a friend and suffer wounds in His
    hands (Zechariah 13:6).\
    \
    One man in how many, the world over, has been betrayed by a friend,
    resulting in wounds in his hands? Estimate: 1 in 1,000 or 1 x
    [\[math\]10\^3\[/math\]]{.render_latex}.
5.  The Messiah will be betrayed for 30 pieces of silver (Zechariah
    11:12).\
    \
    Of the people who have been betrayed, one in how many has been
    betrayed for exactly 30 pieces of silver? Estimate: 1 in 1,000 or 1
    x [\[math\]10\^3\[/math\]]{.render_latex}.
6.  The betrayal money will be used to purchase a potter's field
    (Zechariah 11:13).\
    \
    One man in how many, after receiving a bribe for the betrayal of a
    friend, has returned the money, had it refused, and then experienced
    it being used to buy a potter's field? Estimate: 1 in 100,000 or 1 x
    [\[math\]10\^5\[/math\]]{.render_latex}.
7.  The Messiah will remain silent while He is afflicted (Isaiah 53:7).\
    \
    One man in how many, when he is oppressed and afflicted, though
    innocent, will make no defense of himself? Estimate: 1 in 1,000 or 1
    x [\[math\]10\^3\[/math\]]{.render_latex}.
8.  The Messiah will die by having His hands and feet pierced (Psalm
    22:16).\
    \
    One man in how many, since the time of David, has been crucified?
    Estimate: 1 in 10,000 or 1 x
    [\[math\]10\^4\[/math\]]{.render_latex}.

Multiplying all these probabilities together produces a number (rounded
off) of 1 x [\[math\]10\^{28}\[/math\]]{.render_latex}. Dividing this
number by an estimate of the number of people who have lived since the
time of these prophecies (88 billion) produces a probability of all 8
prophecies being fulfilled accidently in the life of one person. That
probability is 1 in [\[math\]10\^{17}\[/math\]]{.render_latex} or 1 in
100,000,000,000,000,000. That's one in one hundred quadrillion!

In short, the Bible is unique not because of the makeup of the book, but
because of the *subject* of the book. The Bible is unique because Christ
is unique and God's love for us is so uncharacteristically boundless
that the story seems almost too fanciful to be true.

*But what if it is?* Could you imagine how amazing it would be if it
were true?
