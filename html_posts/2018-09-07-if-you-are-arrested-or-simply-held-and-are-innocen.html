**If you are arrested or simply held and are innocent, should you still
refuse to speak to anyone without an attorney?**

Yes.

Let's shorten your answer:

**If you are arrested, you should refuse to speak to anyone without an
attorney.**

That's what they get for arresting you.

- The process is not designed to "let you go" after you are arrested. It
  is designed to "send you to jail" for the crime they are accusing you
  of.
- You are not equipped to navigate this process on your own. No
  disrespect to your level of life knowledge, but this process is
  *highly* slanted against you.
- The police are not your friends. They are doing a job. That job is
  sending you to jail in the most expeditious way possible.

And by the way, they can't "simply hold you" for more than 72 hours
without charging you with a crime.
