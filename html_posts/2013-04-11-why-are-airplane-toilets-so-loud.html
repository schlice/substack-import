**Content:** [A normal toilet is a gravity toilet. It uses water
pressure to draw the water through the drain pipe and into the sewer
line. On an airplane, this configuration is impractical because of the
motion of the aircraft. Therefore, airplanes use a powered vacuum to
suck the contents out of the toilet. These toilets are therefore known
as **vacuum toilets**. Because a vacuum does all the work and not
gravity, vacuum toilets are far more efficient than gravity toilets;
they require far less water to transport contents and to clean the bowl
for the next use. They use just 1/3 the water of a traditional
water-saving toilet (2L vs 6L per flush). Also, the pipes can be
smaller, and they work in any direction. This means that in tricky
installations where holes cannot be cut into the floor, a vacuum toilet
can do the job.\

But you\'re right, the vacuum is noisy.]{.rendered_qtext}
