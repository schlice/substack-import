<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [A normal toilet is a gravity toilet. It uses water<br>pressure to draw the water through the drain pipe and into the sewer<br>line. On an airplane, this configuration is impractical because of the<br>motion of the aircraft. Therefore, airplanes use a powered vacuum to<br>suck the contents out of the toilet. These toilets are therefore known<br>as vacuum toilets. Because a vacuum does all the work and not<br>gravity, vacuum toilets are far more efficient than gravity toilets;<br>they require far less water to transport contents and to clean the bowl<br>for the next use. They use just 1/3 the water of a traditional<br>water-saving toilet (2L vs 6L per flush). Also, the pipes can be<br>smaller, and they work in any direction. This means that in tricky<br>installations where holes cannot be cut into the floor, a vacuum toilet<br>can do the job.\<br>\<br>But you\'re right, the vacuum is noisy.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
