Short answer: no.

Red light tickets are issued to the registered owner of the vehicle.
That owner is responsible for the actions of drivers he allows to
operate his vehicle.

The owner is required to pay the ticket. The owner can then attempt to
extract payment from the driver if he chooses, but red light camera
violations are paid by the registered owner of the vehicle.
