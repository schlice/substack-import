**Can police compel me to give them my phone, tablet or computer
passwords?**

Passwords are considered "testimony," so the police cannot compel you to
reveal your password.

If the court has issued a warrant for something on your computer, you
must provide that something, not your password.

If the court has (somehow) issued a warrant for your password, *then*
you must provide it, or you can be held in contempt of court. However,
it's unlikely that this would ever happen.

Interestingly, the law hasn't yet caught up with technology. While your
password is considered "testimony," *your face and your fingerprints are
not.* If the police hold your iPhone X up to your face and unlock it,
they have not elicited testimony from you. It's already happened at
least once so far, and the courts did not rule that the unlocking was a
5th Amendment violation. In that latest case, they did have a warrant
for the contents of the phone, so they held his phone up to his face and
unlocked it.

But it raises the bigger point that your face and your fingerprints are
not considered testimonial, and so you can be compelled to use them to
unlock devices.
