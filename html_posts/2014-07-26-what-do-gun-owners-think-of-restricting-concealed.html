**Content:** [When we start limiting the \"bearing\" of arms to a
certain group or groups, the \"slippery slope\" will start, and if it\'s
acceptable to limit the \"bearing\" of arms to that group, you can also
by extension find it acceptable to limit the \"keeping\" of arms to that
group as well. Which means that society will eventually find it
acceptable that law-abiding non-military and non-police citizens will
not be able to own firearms.]{.rendered_qtext}
