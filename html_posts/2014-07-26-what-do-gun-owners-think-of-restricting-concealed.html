<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [When we start limiting the \"bearing\" of arms to a<br>certain group or groups, the \"slippery slope\" will start, and if it\'s<br>acceptable to limit the \"bearing\" of arms to that group, you can also<br>by extension find it acceptable to limit the \"keeping\" of arms to that<br>group as well. Which means that society will eventually find it<br>acceptable that law-abiding non-military and non-police citizens will<br>not be able to own firearms.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
