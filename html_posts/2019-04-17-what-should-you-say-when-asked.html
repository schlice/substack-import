**What should I do if I\'m pulled over for speeding and the police
officer asks if I know why I was pulled over?**

Just say, "Gee officer, I don't know. Why do *you* think I was pulled
over?"

Officers these days are taught to avoid that question because they don't
want to be perceived as trying to trap the motorist into confessing to
violating traffic laws.

Instead, most officers will say something along the lines of, "I stopped
you today because I clocked you doing 55 in a 35 mile per hour
residential area. Is everything okay? Is there some reason you're in
such a big hurry?"
