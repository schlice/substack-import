**How can so many Christian\'s be so certain that God exists, even with
such a lack of evidence? Faith means belief even without evidence, so
how?**

Let's start with the second sentence, the claim that "faith means belief
without evidence." That is a simply ridiculous statement. Faith is most
certainly not belief without evidence. *Faith is trust based on
evidence*. But you claim that there is no "evidence." What exactly do
you count as evidence? It sounds like you maybe are thinking that
"evidence" is instead "logical proof." Indeed, what evidence is there
for your idiosyncratic definition of evidence? If you can't provide
evidence for how you define evidence, your position self-destructs
before it even begins.

But if you want to talk about faith, let's look at some things you have
faith in:

- The existence of a physical world outside of your mind
- The existence of other people
- The reliability of your senses
- The comprehensibility of nature

You can't provide evidence for these beliefs that don't assume them. You
simply take them as faith.

The evidence for God is clear. But God doesn't *make* you believe.
Because that's not what he wants. He gave you free will. But if he
announced his presence with trumpets and angels and massive displays of
power, you would be stupid *not* to believe, and that's the exact
opposite of free will.

When we discuss evidence for the existence of God, I prefer the "Why and
Wherefore" argument, because it discusses the why's and wherefores of
"stuff" existing --- anything that physically exists, like matter,
energy, laws of physics, etc. The basics of the argument are simple:

1.  There must be some explanation as to why stuff exists, instead of
    nothing existing at all.
2.  There are only two explanations for why stuff exists:
    1.  Stuff *must* exist, or
    2.  Something else made stuff exist.
3.  There is nothing which shows that stuff must exist.
4.  Therefore, some necessary and eternal something else made stuff
    exist.
5.  There are only two possibilities for what could have made stuff
    exist:
    1.  An eternal universe
    2.  An eternal creator
6.  To date, all evidence points away from an eternal universe and
    towards an eternal creator.
