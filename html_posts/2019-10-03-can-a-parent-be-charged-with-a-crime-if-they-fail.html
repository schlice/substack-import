**Can a parent be charged with a crime if they fail to adequately
supervise their child and their child accidentally pushes a pregnant
Person down a flight of stairs or into a body of water, killing them?**

As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."

Only three states (Illinois, Maryland, and Oregon) have a set minimum
age that a child must reach before they can be left unsupervised, and
it's a different age in each state: Illinois says the child must be 14,
Maryland says the child must be 8, and Oregon says the child must be 10.
Other states have set "guidelines" instead of rules, and many do not
define an exact age, leaving it open to interpretation.

However, that's not what you asked.

You asked if a parent can be charged with a crime when their child
accidentally does something which results in a death. **In this specific
scenario**, we generally do not charge anyone with a **crime** when
someone has an **accident**. Unless there is **criminal negligence** at
play (which in this case, there would not be), it's unlikely that either
the child or the parent would be criminally liable for the death.

That said, it's certainly possible that the parent could be sued in
civil court for negligence resulting in death, and the estate of the
deceased could be monetarily reimbursed.
