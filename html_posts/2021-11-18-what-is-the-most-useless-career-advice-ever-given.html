The most popular answer here says that telling someone "follow your
passion is terrible advice" is not good advice because you should only
work hard and focus on whatever you do. "The only constant in success is
hard work and focus."

But that's not *career advice.* That's *life advice.*

**"Follow your passion"** ***is*** **the most useless career advice ever
given.**

If you are a fan of Mike Rowe and his down-to-earth career advice, take
five minutes out of your day and watch his (admittedly funny) video.

And take his word for it: following your passion is terrible career
advice.

The reason? People who do will ultimately realize that **their**
***passion*** **and their** ***ability*** **have absolutely nothing to
do with each other.**

A small handful of people will follow their passion and will be
successful at it, and that's great. But for the vast majority of us, the
truth is that *your happiness with your work actually has very little to
do with the work itself.*

Mike says you only need to look at the current job market to see why:

> Right now, millions of people with degrees and diplomas are out there
> competing for a relatively narrow set of opportunities that polite
> society calls "good careers." Meanwhile, employers are struggling to
> fill nearly 5.8 million jobs that nobody's trained to do. This is the
> skills gap, it's real, and its cause is actually very simple: when
> people follow their passion, they miss out on all kinds of
> opportunities they didn't even know
> existed.[\[1\]](#HKeDy){#cite-HKeDy .citation_link}

The point is that telling people to follow their passion is, for most
people, very bad career advice, because it will cause you to focus on
doing something that will be unsuccessful. The advice regarding hard
work and focus is unrefined. It's only appropriate to go nose to the
grindstone, head-down and barrel forward *when you're headed in the
right direction.*

So, to kind of bring both answers together, I'd just say this final
thought:

**Don't** ***follow*** **your passion.** ***Apply your passion to
whatever you choose to do*.**
