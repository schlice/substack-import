***Can*** it be sign? Yes, it can be a sign

***Does it mean you have MS?*** By itself, it does not mean you have MS.

There are hundreds of different explanations for muscle twitching. Some
are common, some are not so common. Your doctor can help you sort
through those.

A diagnosis of MS is a diagnosis of *exclusion*, which means you have to
exclude all other possibilities for the symptoms you see before you can
diagnose someone with MS.

Therefore, you need to start with your exclusions. Make an appointment
with your doctor and talk to him/her about all of your symptoms. Go from
there. Once they get to the point where they say, \"we have no other
explanations,\" then you should see a neurologist to dig further. Don\'t
put the cart before the horse here.
