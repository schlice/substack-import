No, they are not above the law. But they know that they're never going
to be called out on it, as it is "technically" not a Constitutional
rights violation. While using their foot to keep your door open is
"technically" an entry into your home, they don't actually "enter" your
home. So at best, it's a legal gray area.

(EDIT) Some states have actually legislated this already, defining when
someone "enters" the home. For every state which has passed this
legislation, "breaking the plane" of the door constitutes "entry" into
the home. So in those states, sticking a foot in the door would be an
unlawful entry without exigent circumstances or a warrant.

So for the states which do not have this protection, how do you prevent
this? How can you legally protect yourself?

There are a number of ways to combat this type of activity.

- The one I like the best is ***installing a screen door.*** I can open
  my main door and leave my screen door closed. I can talk to the
  officer through my screen door without ever going outside or leaving
  an open path. Now, they cannot legally open your screen door, but you
  can still have a full conversation right through it. Besides, there
  are a number of benefits to having a screen door on your entry door.
  The one I specifically use is this one:

- In conjunction with this, ***install security cameras which can see
  your front door***. And if it is at all possible, *make sure you
  install them high enough that they can't be reached from the ground
  without a ladder*. Officers have been known to cover security cameras
  when they arrive on your front porch, and *some of this activity is
  actually department policy.* They will actually stand in front of your
  doorbell camera to block that, so you can't rely on any camera which
  is physically at body level.
  - At the same time, if a police officer is talking to you at your
    door, ***record them with your phone***. They have body cams, you
    need your own. You should always have two recordings going, your
    phone and your cameras. Maybe find a way to clip your phone to your
    shirt so that you can start a recording and then leave it to record.
    I was just poking around on Amazon, and I found this:

[[Amazon.com: Ghostek UNIVERSAL HOLSTER with 360-Degree Swivel Belt Clip

Wide with Rubberized Sides to Keep Your Device Secure (2nd-Gen) (Black)

- - *(NOTE: This isn't an endorsement of this product, and there's no
    affiliate link here, but this is at least one product you can use to
    clip any phone to your shirt so you can have your own "body cam.")*
- Finally, if the police do manage to get a foot in the door, you must
  verbally tell them that **you do not consent to any searches** and, if
  they are questioning you, **you are under no obligation to talk to
  them**, and we recommend that beyond identification, you don't talk to
  them at all. That is the default position. Exercise your right to
  remain silent.
