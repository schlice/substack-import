**Content:** [There is no logic or reason to it. There is no argument
that can be made that shows that alcohol somehow has some social benefit
that guns don\'t have. It doesn\'t. My right to own a gun allows me to
protect myself from other people with guns. My right to own a beer
doesn\'t protect me from drunk drivers.\
\
Therefore, any logical thought would lead you to the truth that before
any serious discussion of any partial or full ban on guns, you should
first completely ban alcohol. Critics will point to Prohibition, citing
exactly how poorly it worked, increasing black markets and enabling
crime, ***but they ignore the fact that a ban on guns will do exactly
the same thing.*** See, guns will never ever go away. And there are 300
million of them in the United States.\
\
What\'s that? Buyback, you say? Even if you gave me WAY under market
value for my gun (i.e. a \$50 gift card for every gun I turn in), with
300 million guns in circulation, that\'s \$15 Billion. Where exactly do
you think we\'re going to come up with \$15 Billion? Once you repeal the
monstrosity that is Obamacare, we might have enough money to buy back
all the guns.\
\
Logically, if you\'re going to trust Americans with the responsibility
to purchase and use a dangerous item, it stands to reason that you
should also trust them enough to purchase a ***less*** dangerous item,
especially when the right to own the less dangerous item is protected by
the Constitution.\
\
If you\'re going to remove one of two dangerous items from the American
people, it only stands to reason that you would remove the one that is,
far and away, more dangerous and destructive than one that is less
dangerous and destructive.\
\
We all logically know that alcohol is far more dangerous than guns will
ever be, and no amount of statistical wrangling will ever make it seem
any less so. So why then do we insist on this silliness of trying to
implement a partial or a complete ban on guns? It simply comes down to
this: \"I like alcohol, but I don\'t like guns.\" There is no argument
that you can make for banning guns that isn\'t equally or better applied
to banning alcohol.\
\
Don\'t get me wrong, I don\'t think there should be a return to
Prohibition. I just want people to see that some of their political
views may be quite contradictory.]{.rendered_qtext}
