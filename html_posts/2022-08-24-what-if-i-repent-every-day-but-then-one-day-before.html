We, in this space, believe in what is sometimes called OSAS, but It
means "Once Saved, Always Saved."

**If you have accepted that you are a sinner, you believe that Christ
died for your sins, and you confessed with your mouth that Christ is
your lord and savior and you humbly asked for forgiveness and for Christ
to take over your life,** and you have done this with your whole heart
in a true spirit of obedience, we believe you are *saved*.

Salvation is a one-time action. Christ died once to save us. We are
saved once. We don't have to be "re-saved," and we believe you can't
lose your salvation unless you intentionally walk away from your faith
in Christ.

In other words, **once you have been saved, you do not "lose" your
salvation.**

We are all sinners, and we will all face judgement at the end of days.
We will all stand before the throne and will all have our sins laid
bare. For the believer who has accepted Christ, the penalty for ALL of
our sins is paid for by Christ; past, present, and future. All sins are
paid for.

But what about sins for which we haven't repented?

First. are you *absolutely sure* that you didn't miss a sin? I know I'm
not. When we know that we can sin in thoughts, I can tell you just how
possible it is that I'd miss something. And as hard as I try, as hard as
I pray for the Spirit to reveal to me my sins so that I can repent of
them, I bet there's something that I missed. And let's say, for
argument's sake, that I'm driving home with my wife and we're having a
bad evening for some reason and I speak harshly with her, and the car
gets quiet. I don't have an opportunity to confess my sins and repent,
and we immediately get hit by a truck and die. I have sinned and didn't
have the opportunity to repent. Did I just forfeit my salvation?

Second, there is a difference in the *quality* of sin between one who
has been saved and one who has not been saved. For the unsaved, there is
a sort of *more deliberate, more eager, more persistent* pattern of sin,
perhaps you could think of it as a "settled" pattern of sin. Do you
think that the person who engages in this pattern of sin after they have
been "saved" has really repented, and is really trying to live as a
saved Christian should? For that person who sins in that way, I believe
he was probably never really saved in the first place.

So I really feel there are two types of sins: the sins that we all, as
believers, engage in because we are human and we will always fall (and
we try with our whole heart to confess those when we learn about them,
or when we realize we've done them), and the type of persistent,
deliberate, settled, intentional pattern of sin which categorizes
someone who has not been saved (even if they believe they were, but they
persist in an *intentional* pattern of sin). And I think the intention
is very important in that type of sin pattern.

I believe God knows us, he loves us, and for those of us who have
repented and accepted Christ, he doesn't hold our honest mistake in
failing to repent for a sin against our salvation.

From here, we can get into the really deep Biblical stuff about
"heavenly rewards" that our sin may cost us, but Christians can rest
assured that **once saved, always saved.**
