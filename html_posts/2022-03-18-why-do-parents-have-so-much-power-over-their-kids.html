You are under the mistaken belief that you have more "rights" than you
actually do.

Under the law, you are a *minor*. Your parents have complete control
over your life until you reach the "age of majority," the age that
society has determined that you are old enough to make decisions for
yourself.

But until that age, legally you don't really have any rights that your
parents cannot override. This is because if you are not legally able to
make decisions for yourself (and until you turn 18, you are not), then
your parents are *completely and totally responsible for everything
about your life.*

It's a big responsibility. Parents generally do their best to make sure
you are set up to have a successful life. But understand, parents are
human too. Sometimes they make mistakes.

So let's talk about what you brought up:

> Why do parents have so much power over their kids?

Because kids do not have power over themselves until they turn 18.

> *They can ruin their mental state for 18 years*

In the vast majority of cases, parents are not "ruining the mental
states of children." They are attempting to raise those children in the
way in which they see fit.

> and then expect them to accept their apology.

You are under no obligation to accept their apology. But if I could
offer you some advice: unless your parents are locking you in a cage
from the time you come home from school until the time you go back to
school, I think they are probably trying their best.

Here's another point to consider: if you want to be treated like an
adult, have you tried acting like an adult? If I had a person in my life
with whom I felt like you do towards your parents, I'd tell them that I
had some concerns and I wanted to sit down and have a discussion with
them about it. And then talk to them rationally. Tell them what you
feel, why you feel it, and what you think should be done about it.
Discuss it with them.

Why do parents have so much power over their kids? They can ruin their
mental state for 18 years and then expect them to accept their apology.
My mom doesn\'t give me any power over any decisions. When I fight for
my rights its called \'ungreatful\'
