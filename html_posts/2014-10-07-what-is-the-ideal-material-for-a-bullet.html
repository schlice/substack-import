**Content:** [Actually, lead is a great material for a bullet. It
deforms just easily enough that when it strikes the target, it deforms
and tumbles. This keeps the bullet in the target rather than continuing
on through the person and into other nearby targets. But it\'s hard
enough to hold its shape throughout its launch and flight.\
\
There\'s plenty of harder substances from which we can make bullets. But
we don\'t need harder.]{.rendered_qtext}
