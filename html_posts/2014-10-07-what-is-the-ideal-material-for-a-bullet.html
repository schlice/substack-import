<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Actually, lead is a great material for a bullet. It<br>deforms just easily enough that when it strikes the target, it deforms<br>and tumbles. This keeps the bullet in the target rather than continuing<br>on through the person and into other nearby targets. But it\'s hard<br>enough to hold its shape throughout its launch and flight.\<br>\<br>There\'s plenty of harder substances from which we can make bullets. But<br>we don\'t need harder.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
