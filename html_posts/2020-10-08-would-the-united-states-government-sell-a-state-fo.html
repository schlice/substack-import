**Would the United States Government sell a state for
\$100,000,000,000,000 (100 trillion)?**

*Would* they? In a hot second. I know a few states Trump would be
willing to sell without a second thought.

*Could* they, though? Nope, not a chance.

Even if they wanted to sell a state to a foreign country (and that
foreign country were willing to buy that state), the government has no
authority to do so.

When a state entered the **union**, it did so through mutual agreement
with all of the other states. That means that the state wanted to join,
and the other states allowed them to join. It was a *mutual* agreement.
Also, it is Congress who drives the admission of a state into the Union,
not the "government," by which you probably mean the President.

While a state voluntarily leaving the union has been discussed (but
never seriously), and the Constitution has nothing regarding such an
event (because the thought of it never even crossed the minds of the
founders), if it were to even approach the idea of legality, all states
would have to agree to allow the one state to leave the union. But even
so, *selling* a state sounds like something that would be *involuntary*
and in such a capacity would definitely be unconstitutional. You can't
deprive people of their citizenship involuntarily, and selling a state
would mean potentially hundreds of thousands of citizens having their
citizenship involuntarily revoked. There's no way in Hades that such a
scheme would even get off the ground, let alone fly.
