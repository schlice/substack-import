It's an interesting question, because you're asking someone to
***prove*** that God does not exist.

Philosopher and educator Mortimer Adler said it this way: "An
*affirmative* existential proposition can be proved, but a *negative*
existential proposition---one that denies the existence of some
thing---cannot be proved."

For example, I could say that red eagles exist, and you could say that
red eagles do not exist. I only need to show one example of a red eagle
to prove that they exist. You would need to be in all places at all
times throughout all of earth's history to prove that red eagles do not
exist, and never did exist.

This is why honest non-theists admit that they cannot *prove* that God
does not exist.
