**We live in a 4-unit condo, and one of our neighbors who lives on the
first floor has been spying on us. What should we do?**

As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."

Depending on how the person is spying on you will determine whether you
go to the police (if a crime is being committed) or if you hire a
private investigator to establish enough proof that spying is happening
and that you have been financially impacted.

This kind of thing is really outside the purview of the HOA, as this is
first and foremost a legal issue between tenants.
