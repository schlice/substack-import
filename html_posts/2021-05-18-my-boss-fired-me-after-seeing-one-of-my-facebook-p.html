In the United States, if you are not a contract employee, the answer is
no.

Most employment in the United States is what is known as "at will"
employment. The employer can fire you at any time for any
**non-protected reason**, and you can quit at any time without being
required to "give notice" or any arrangement under which you must do
some administrative thing before you are permitted to stop working.

Certain things cannot be a basis for employment termination. They are
(at the federal level) your race, religion, sex, age, disability, or
country of origin. Some states and some local jurisdictions (counties,
cities, etc) have added sexual orientation as a protected class. And
disability only counts if you cannot do the job you were hired to do
even with reasonable accommodations.

If your employer decides that he no longer likes you, he can fire you.
If he doesn't like your values, or your Facebook posts, or your hair
style, or your choice of friends, he can fire you. Just so long as he
doesn't fire you because you're black, or because you're a girl (or a
boy), or because you're a Muslim.

In this case, he fired you because he doesn't like your political
values. In the United States, in most cases, this is perfectly legal.

For further assistance, you should check with an attorney in your area
who specializes in employment law.

Original question:

My boss fired me after seeing one of my Facebook posts in support of
Palestine, telling me that he cannot "rub elbows with a terrorist
sympathizer?" Can I file a lawsuit against him for wrongful termination?
