When we're talking about things like this, we should always remember the
old adage:

**Never attribute to malice what could easily be explained by
stupidity.**

People are attacking Trump over classified materials in his home.

Yet people so quickly forget that Hillary (who was not the president,
mind you) had an official government email server in her house, which
was routinely handling tens of thousands of classified emails, and which
was revealed by forensic analysis to have likely been compromised.

The truth is that this document thing happens with presidents all the
time when they leave office. It happened with Obama, and it happened
with George W. Bush. Trump didn't personally order any of those
documents removed from the White House. The GSA has contractors who
packed up his documents and personal effects from the White House and
moved them to Mar-a-Lago. There were many boxes of documents which were
likely in storage, and he likely had no idea what was in there.

And yet, Trump became the first former president to have a search
warrant served at his private residence over documents.

Sounds legit...

And with the Secret Service security around that place, do you really
think that those documents were wholly unprotected? All of the people
who had access to that residence were thoroughly vetted and had
clearance. Not necessarily clearance to see those documents, but they
weren't "Joe off the street," and they definitely weren't "Russian
spies."

When the Trump Presidential Library is built (and I have mixed feelings
while typing those words), the documents would have gone through a
validation period and would have either been sent to the library, or
back to DC. This validation is done because a third party does the move.

**Never attribute to malice what could easily be explained by
stupidity.**

**And if you** ***are*** **starting with the opinion and the contention
that it is malicious, you probably have an agenda.**
