**Content:** [You should have waited to process the full refund until
you had the phone. In the future, if you run into such a situation:\

- Have the buyer return the phone. Make sure the phone arrives in the
  same condition in which you sent it. Make sure the buyer knows that
  the refund will be commensurate with the condition of the returned
  phone.
- Process the refund once you have the phone in hand and it is in the
  same condition in which you sent it. Process an appropriate refund
  depending on the condition of the phone.
- When you get it back, restore it to factory software. Don\'t sell it
  with CyanogenMod on it.
- Call the Customer Service number for your carrier. Make sure the phone
  is paid for, and is listed as yours. You will need to give them the
  IMEI. If there is documentation that shows the same for that IMEI, ask
  for it.
- Since the phone is paid for, make them remove the carrier lock. There
  is normally a website that allows you to do this.
- Sell the phone as stock but carrier-unlocked so it can be used on any
  carrier that supports that frequency.
- Also, don\'t accept unlimited refunds. Refunds should be limited to 7
  days, which should be long enough to determine if the phone works or
  not.
