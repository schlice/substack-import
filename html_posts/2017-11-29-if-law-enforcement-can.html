First of all, let's clarify the dwelling you're talking about, because
it sounds like a game warden can waltz right up to your front door in
beautiful downtown \<insert_city_name_here\> and bust on in without a
warrant.

Clearly, that's not true.

But game wardens can indeed come on to your land, and can enter your
dwelling, to check for illegal game.

How can they do this? You agreed to let them, when you bought a hunting
license. The rules for what game wardens are allowed to do in your state
are in your state laws surrounding protection of game, and you agreed to
these provisions when you bought a hunting license. Failure to allow a
game warden to search will result in two things:

1.  Loss of your hunting privileges in the state, which would apply
    whether or not they find any evidence from #2.
2.  The game warden returning with the sheriff and a warrant.

That said, accessing your land without a warrant is covered by the "open
fields" exception to the Fourth Amendment. An individual cannot
reasonably expect to have privacy in woodlands or fields that are
generally accessible to the public. The case *Hester v. United States*
found that "the special protection accorded by the Fourth Amendment to
the people in their 'persons, houses, papers, and effects,' is not
extended to the open fields.\" The courts have decided that woods,
fields and streams do not constitute the equivalent of "persons, houses,
papers, and effects," and fencing and/or signage indicating private
property are not likely to change that. It might make a civilian subject
to trespassing laws, but a game warden who is performing his duties
would likely be covered by that "open fields" exception.

Depending on how you protect it and how far away from the house it is,
the area immediately outside of your "dwelling" may be called
"curtilage" and may also be protected by the 4th Amendment. If your
"curtilage" is just protected by chicken wire, clearly visible from
"open fields" areas, you may lose the curtilage protections from the
"plain sight" exceptions. But if you have a 6 foot privacy fence
installed around your "dwelling," your "curtilage" is likely protected.

Game wardens can usually enter your dwelling and search your freezers
and storage areas for illegally obtained game. They generally have to
have some indication that you were involved in some form of illegal
hunting, and they have to be able to articulate that information, but
again, the hunting laws in the state generally allow game wardens to
enter your property and search the appropriate areas for evidence of
illegal hunting activities.
