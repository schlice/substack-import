**Isn't hiding the "whistleblower" from President Trump a violation of
his Sixth Amendment Right to confront his accuser?**

Of course it is.

The idea behind the "whistleblower" statute is to protect the
whistleblower from **reprisal**, not to shield his or her identity.

The statute prevents the accused from taking action against the
whistleblower for things like revealing company secrets while reporting
the alleged unlawful activity. It was not designed to circumvent the 6th
Amendment. The President still has a right to confront his accuser.

(EDIT: Let's be clear here. There is no court, and there is no criminal
case, so the 6th Amendment doesn't directly apply. We're not talking
about filing a motion or anything so procedural. It's the *idea* behind
the 6th Amendment that we're discussing).
