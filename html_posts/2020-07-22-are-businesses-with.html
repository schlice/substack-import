**Are businesses with \"Mandatory Face Mask\" policies violating Title
III of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA")?**

In general, no.

Businesses are required to provide **reasonable** accommodations to
persons with disabilities.

Most businesses have determined that allowing anyone to enter without a
face mask is an unreasonable risk to everyone else in the store.

Instead the business provides *other, more reasonable* accommodations,
which don't include coming into the store without a mask: curbside
delivery, car-side delivery, free home delivery, etc. Most businesses
are extremely willing to work with anyone who cannot wear a mask, so
long as they don't come in to the store.

Additionally, it is generally accepted that a person who cannot wear a
face mask can instead wear a face shield and it will provide reasonable
protection against their droplets. Not all businesses allow this
workaround, though.

So long as the business provides reasonable accommodations, they do not
have to provide ***every*** accommodation requested by the disabled
person.
