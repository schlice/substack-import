**Do symptoms calm down when MS patients cry?**

It would be easy to dismiss this question as nonsense. We've had all
these decades of treating MS symptoms with many varieties of treatments,
including corticosteroids and pain killes, and you say you can *cry your
way to feeling better?*

Well not so fast, it's at least conceivable that the idea has some
merit.

The endorphines and hormones present in emotional tears are fascinating.
Leucine-enkephalin is an endorphine which reduces pain and boosts mood,
so MS pain could be temporarily relieved by its release.

But more interesting to me is the pregnancy hormone *prolactin*, which
has been shown in studies to actually trigger *the rebuilding of
myelin*. Of course, its use in men is contraindicated due to the
propensity for prolactin to induce male lactation. Eww...

But still, it is at least within the realm of possibility that crying
emotional tears (like when you watch a sad movie) could, at least
potentially, help your MS symptoms. To the best of my knowledge, this
has never been studied. But maybe it should be.
