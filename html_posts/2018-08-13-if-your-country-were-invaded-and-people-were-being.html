**If your country were invaded and people were being forced into
detention centers, would you as a civilian respect the Geneva
Conventions or fight back in any way possible, with no regard for rules
of war?**

The Geneva Conventions and the Code of Conduct are for members of the
Armed Forces fighting in the nation's military. They do not apply to
civilians. They do not apply to unorganized militias.
