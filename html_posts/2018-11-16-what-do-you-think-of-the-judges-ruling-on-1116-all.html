**What do you think of the judges ruling on 11/16, allowing Jim Acosta
to have his White House pass back, saying it was wrong for the White
House to revoke it?**

While I'm certain that's what you wanted the ruling to say, that's not
exactly what happened.

First of all, it's a temporary restraining order. That means that the
case has not yet been heard, so there are no "rulings" yet.

Second, it was on ***5th Amendment*** grounds, not 1st Amendment. The
judge basically agreed with CNN that Acosta was not afforded due process
in having his hard pass revoked, and that this was a violation of
Acosta's 5th Amendment right to due process. It says nothing about
whether or not Acosta has a 1st Amendment right to a hard pass.

Finally, he may have his hard pass back, but Sanders is under no legal
obligation to call on him. I hope she simply bypasses him and calls on
other, more mature CNN reporters until his case can be heard.
