**Content:** [This has been a question that Congress, the Supreme Court,
and states have been wrestling with since the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\
\
For the most part, the court has found that the Civil Rights Act is
constitutional, and is complementary to most protections in the
Constitution. Where we are finding difference is in gay rights. Only 21
states and the District of Columbia have made \"sexual orientation\" a
protected class under the Civil Rights Act. The reason that so many
states (and the Federal government) have not added the same protection
is because of the conflict between **the right to be free from
discrimination** and **the right to freely practice one\'s religion.**
Churches, church-affiliated organizations, and some private
organizations have successfully made such First Amendment claims. The
Free Exercise clause states that Congress shall make no law prohibiting
the free exercise of religion. Laws that burden religious practice
without a compelling state interest can be overturned on Free Exercise
grounds. Imposing public accommodation laws which protect sexual
orientation may burden free exercise of religion, especially in
businesses with expressive, or speech-related purposes (such as wedding
photography).\
\
Legal scholars are all over the map on where to draw the line (i.e. in a
zero-sum game, religious liberty wins or gay rights wins). Clearly,
there should be sexual orientation protections in public accommodations
nationwide. But just as clearly, there should be sensible religious
exemptions built in. For example, you could say that churches and
church-affiliated organizations would be able to claim a religious
exemption. Also, businesses with over X employees would not be eligible
for religious exemption to the public accommodation law, which allows
for small businesses, which are generally privately held and more
personally invested and run by the owners, to maintain religious
exemptions, where larger businesses which are not as deeply religious as
smaller ones, would not. You would also have to deny exemptions to
certain types of public accommodations, such as the ones that provide
emergency services (i.e. emergency room doctors and nurses, EMT\'s), or
others in which denying such services places a person\'s life or health
in jeopardy, such as basic accommodations like hotels and motels, or
other emergency services like towing services. Therefore, the pharmacist
in the hospital would not be exempt, where the pharmacist in the strip
mall might. The pharmacist in the Wal-Mart might not be exempt, and the
pharmacist in the strip mall might not if he was the only pharmacist
within hundreds of miles.\
\
Applying new public accommodations standards in this way allows for some
religious exemptions to small, privately-held businesses, and it also
allows for the \"narrowing of the field\" in the future, and applying
further restrictions on who might get an exemption.]{.rendered_qtext}
