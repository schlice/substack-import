*A majority (57%) want more strict gun laws. A large majority (89%) want
background checks on all gun purchases. A majority (57%) wants a ban on
assault weapons.*

Let's dissect these poll numbers, shall we?

**Universal Background Checks**

If you buy a gun from a gun dealer in the United States (a "gun dealer"
is someone who makes a living buying and selling guns), you are required
to get a background check. When the National Firearms Act was passed,
Congress wanted to make sure that the regulations were not overly
onerous on the general population. For example, if I own a gun and I
want to gift it to my grandson, would he need a background check? If I
own a gun and I want to sell it to my friend, would we need background
checks? To cover these scenarios, **personal sales or transfers** of
firearms were exempted from the requirement for background checks. After
all, only dealers have access to the NICS background check system. The
system is not designed to handle the volume of transactions that public
access would bring.

Therefore, to implement universal background checks, the ***entire NICS
system*** would have to be overhauled. You would have to allow
unfettered full access to NICS for anyone. You would have to build a
frontend web-based user interface that allowed you to query a Social
Security Number and generate a certificate that can be printed and
included with a firearms transfer. This would be a very costly change,
but could be made if there was enough political capital behind it.

But there simply isn't. Why? *With one exception, every mass shooter in
the United States over the last twenty years passed every background
check and purchased their firearms legally. Increasing background checks
would not have stopped any one.*

**TL;DR: Universal background checks wouldn't have prevented a single
mass shooting over the last 20 years.**

**Assault Weapons**

What is an "assault weapon?" Can you go into a gun store and go over to
the "assault weapons" section and browse their offerings? The short
answer is no, because "assault weapon" is a term largely created by the
media. The National Firearms Act does have a definition for "assault
weapon" though, and it is basically a weapon that fires more than one
round with one trigger pull. We also call them "automatic weapons." The
National Firearms Act has essentially banned public access to automatic
weapons.

Then why is there so much of a kerfuffle about "assault weapons?" To be
honest, I don't know.

Let me give you an example.

Which one of these weapons is an assault weapon? If you answered **B**,
you just proved the point.

In actuality, *both of these weapons are identical.* They are both a
Ruger 10/22. They both fire .22 LR ammunition, and they both have a
10-round magazine capacity. The bullet moves at exactly the same speed.
The bottom rifle has a suppressor (which actually is already a regulated
item), a foregrip, a shrouded barrel, a collapsible stock, and a pistol
grip. According to legislation about "assault weapons," these are the
items which are restricted. **They are nothing more than "cosmetic"
items**. They don't affect the accuracy or the lethality of the bullet.

**TL;DR: When people in a survey want a ban on "assault weapons," they
simply don't know what they are asking for.**

So now to answer your question.

*If the majority want this, why isn't Congress listening to them?*

The majority could also want Congress to mandate laser-beam eyes in all
children born starting next year, and retrofitting all Americans within
10 years. That doesn't mean it's going to happen. Just asking people if
they want background checks in a survey isn't going to help anyone drive
public policy.

Americans want *something* to be done. The problem is that no one knows
what that something should be.

Intelligent Americans know that we need to address the problem, not the
symptom. The gun is a symptom. It is true that many killers will default
to a gun because they are easy to acquire, and since many of these
killers have "hidden" mental issues, they blend in to society and appear
like normal citizens. Omar Mateen had a government firearms license and
regularly worked with a firearm. He was a trustworthy person who, from
all appearances, finally just "snapped."

*How do you legislate that?*

The bottom line is: **you can't**. Congress knows this. They also know
that the gun owners of America are a very powerful voting bloc and they
are fully aware that taking away rights as enumerated in the Bill of
Rights does not sit well with Americans. No other country has a Bill of
Rights protecting rights guaranteed to all citizens of the country. This
is why people from outside of America find it so confusing that Congress
can't just "pass a law" and "make gun control." In Colorado, a magazine
restriction limiting capacity to 10 rounds caused the two state
representatives who wrote the bill to be recalled from office. When gun
owners get behind an issue, they can be a very powerful force.

The bottom line is that while polls may reflect feelings, the results of
polls cannot be directly translated into legislation.
