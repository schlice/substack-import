Look, I love to dog on Democrats every day and twice on Sunday, but you
got suckered by fake news.

Yes, there was a lone Democrat (Rep. Shri Thanedar, D-Mich.) pushing for
Articles of Impeachment, and two days ago, he was about to introduce a
measure which would have *forced* the House to vote on his articles.

House Democrat leadership took him into a room and beat him squarely
about the head and shoulders, after which he reconsidered his notion to
force a vote on his articles.

He came out of said room and made a glowing pronouncement that he's not
pursuing his motion to force the vote because, he says, Trump committed
*even more impeachable offenses* since he penned his **seven** Articles
of Impeachment.

In reality, top Democrat leaders told him that pushing this now is a
distraction, will only fuel the Republican narrative against them, and
it will force Democrats to be on the record about some things which they
already walked back in their districts. So they made him back off.

The whole "plane" thing just cracks me up. I just love how when any
Republican thinks that accepting a plane from Qatar is "smelly" (Sen.
Rand Paul), then suddenly all Republicans believe that accepting the
plane is "wrong." First, it's only wrong if Congress doesn't approve the
gift. Second, it's not a Constitutional violation because it's not
enriching Trump. The plane is going to the Air Force, and then to the
Trump Library, hardly an emolument. Next, the plane was not a condition
of any deal; it was a free gift from Qatar; no strings were attached to
it, and no future consideration will be given for it. And finally, it
still doesn't count as an impeachable offense just because you think
it's wrong. Impeachment isn't to be used to justify your opinion on
someone's behavior. That's what the ballot box is for.

I expect that if the deal is to go through (nothing is done yet on the
plane, BTW), Congress will have the opportunity to approve the gift.

From a security standpoint, I certainly wouldn't use the plane as Air
Force One without a substantial refit, but if they do such a refit, it
would be a substantially cheaper way to get an updated AF1 into the
inventory assuming Congress accepts the gift.

Regardless, Articles of Impeachment just prove that Democrats believe
that you can basically impeach anyone for anything you don't like, even
though impeachment was Constitutionally reserved for "high crimes and
misdemeanors," not Constitutionally-approved processes which haven't
even concluded yet.

But whatever, radical progressives have taken over the Democrat party,
and they show no sign of retreating in their far-left nuttiness.
