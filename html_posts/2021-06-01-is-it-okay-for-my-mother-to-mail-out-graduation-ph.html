So you asked if this was "okay." Okay, in this context, has a few
meanings.

If you mean "okay" as in "is it legal," the answer is yes in the US
anyway. Your mother is still your legal guardian and makes decisions on
your behalf until the day you turn 18.

If you mean "okay" as in "is it good parenting to ignore your wishes"
then the answer is probably not. At your age, you're going to remember
this as you go off and start your life, and there's a good chance that
this incident will weigh heavily on how much interaction you have with
your mother after you're out on your own.
