First of all, as with all legal answers, this is not legal advice. To
get legal advice, you must consult an attorney in your area. This is
general information. To get specific advice for specific situations, you
must contact an attorney.

Under N.J.S.A. 2C:14-4, *it is unlawful for a person to commit any
flagrantly lewd and offensive act that one knows or reasonably expects
is likely to be observed by other non-consenting individuals who would
be affronted and alarmed.*

Notice that the statute doesn't say anything about where you are, or
what fences you are protected by. It simply states that you can be
charged under the statute if you are ***likely to be observed*** by a
non-consenting individual. You should also note that the statute doesn't
mention whether or not you truly believed you were in an area that you
were likely to not be observed. It only mentions reasonable expectation,
so the test is the "reasonable person" standard. In other words, would a
reasonable person in that situation believe that it is likely that they
would be observed?

In your case, because you have elevated property around you which can
see into your yard, a reasonable person would believe that you are
likely to be observed by non-consenting individuals. Therefore, it's
likely that you could be charged under NJ's indecent exposure law.

If you are convicted of violating N.J.S.A. 2C:14-4, you could be
punished by up to a 30-day jail term and a fine of up to \$1,000.
However, if your nudity was observed by a child under 13, or an
individual suffering from a mental disability or deficiency that
prevents him from understanding the nature of your conduct, then the
severity of the crime increases, and you could face up to 18 months in
jail and pay a fine of up to \$10,000.

**TL;DR: Under NJ law, if someone sees you from those high windows, you
could be charged with indecent exposure, even in your own back yard.**
