This is an interesting topic. It seems as if you break down your
military options based on what job you\'re going to be doing.

If that\'s the case, I\'m sorry to report that *you\'re looking at the
military all wrong.*

First and foremost, you are a member of the United States Armed Forces.
Secondary to that, you have a specialty (i.e. a job). Your job comes
second to the fact that you\'re wearing a uniform. And all things being
equal, I\'d rather be wearing officer\'s insignia than enlisted
insignia. And it has nothing at all to do with how I feel about officers
or enlisteds.

I was an officer in the Air Force. Before I got out to my first duty
assignment, one of the most important lessons I learned was once I got
to my first duty station, I should find a good, sharp senior NCO and
glom on to him/her. Learn everything you can from that person. At my
first duty station, I had several senior NCOs that I spent many hours
working with and learning from. They are absolutely the best people in
the world, and I have nothing but respect for the time and effort they
put into their work. But ultimately, even as a 22 year old shiny new
Second Lieutenant, I still outrank them. All of them. My pay scale
advances faster and farther than theirs ever can (just check out
military pay scales online; it\'s all public knowledge).

And probably one of the most important things to remember: you\'re not a
manager. That\'s a civilian thing. As an officer, you are much more than
a manager: you\'re a *commander*. That means a whole lot more than just
being a manager. Commanders are totally responsible for their people, on
duty and off. A manager ensures you get your job done; when you go home,
your manager has nothing to do with anything you do once you leave the
workplace. A commander is fully responsible for everything that his
people do, both on-duty and off-duty. If one of your young two-stripers
gets drunk downtown and arrested, you are going to go get them. You are
responsible to ensure that their families are taken care of, that they
have adequate housing, that their kids are properly enrolled in school,
etc. No civilian manager position can ever rise to the level of
responsibility you incur when you are a commander. Only a military
officer can be a commander.

Now that we\'ve gotten that out of the way, there\'s more opportunities
for enlisted people to do different jobs because *there\'s more enlisted
people.* Think of the military as a pyramid. The lowest ranks are at the
bottom, but the largest number of people are there. As you advance in
rank, there are fewer and fewer people in those ranks. About halfway up,
the officers start. Same thing, but there\'s even fewer officers. So
there are more \"jobs\" available to enlisteds because there are just
more of them. Officers still accomplish highly technical work, and some
scientific career fields are only open to officers. As a Crew Commander
in NORAD, I had to be certified on the system just as my enlisted System
Controllers had to be certified. I did exactly the same work they did,
but I was the crew commander. I was responsible for my crew. I was
responsible for them when they were assigned to my crew, making sure
they were properly settled in housing, that their families were cared
for, and if I made a decision that the Flight or Squadron Commander did
not agree with, I was responsible for that decision (by the way, as a
young officer, I certainly did that). I advocated on behalf of my crew
to senior staff. I took those experiences with me when I worked on the
senior staff, and used them to make life better for them in whatever
ways I could. Only officers can do that.

Bottom line, if you have the opportunity to become an officer, you would
be absolutely crazy not to take it. Finish your degree and once you have
your diploma in hand, head down to the military recruiter. While Officer
Candidate School (OCS) opportunities have been dwindling over the years,
they are still there. Take the opportunity.
