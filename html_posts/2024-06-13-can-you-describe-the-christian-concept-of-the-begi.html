We know that time and space began to exist. The evidence for this is
abundant and growing. You can start with the Second Law of
Thermodynamics, and move to the expanding universe, the radiation echo
from the Big Bang, galaxy seeds, and Einstein's Theory of General
Relativity, among many others, and you can see that **all time, all
space, all energy** and **all matter** began at a single point.

The Law of Causality tells us that everything which begins to exist has
a cause. The universe, from all of the evidence we have today, began to
exist. Therefore, the universe had a cause.

Something caused the universe to come into existence. And because that
something existed before the universe did, that something must be
*outside* of the universe. It must be outside of time (timeless),
outside of space and matter (immaterial), and outside of energy
(omnipotent). And in order to create as massively complex a universe as
it did, it must be extremely intelligent.

So the cause of the universe, therefore, is timeless, immaterial,
omnipotent and incredibly intelligent. That "thing," the eternal,
immaterial, omnipotent, intelligent cause of the universe, is what most
people refer to as "God."
