**If Trump wins the election, could he try to get COTUS and SCOTUS to
change the 22nd amendment so he could run a third time?**

In order to be able to modify a Constitutional Amendment, you must
**pass a new amendment** which supersedes the old one. There are a very
limited number of ways this can be done, and none of them involve the
Supreme Court, nor do they involve the President. It is done in two
phases:

1.  The Amendment must be **written**
2.  The Amendment must be **ratified**

To **write** the Amendment, the Constitution allows for two methods:

- A supermajority of Congress (both houses) must pass a Bill of
  Amendment. This is the preferred method for writing a Constitutional
  Amendment. All of our existing Constitutional Amendments were written
  in this way.
- 34 states can call for and convene a Constitutional Convention
  (sometimes called an "Article V Convention" since it is described in
  Article V of the Constitution). In the entire history of the nation,
  this has never been implemented, even though the Constitution has
  instructions for doing so. The reason it is in there is so that states
  always retain the power to amend the Constitution, even over the
  collective will (or lack thereof) of the Congress. The down side to an
  Article V Convention is that *multiple* items can be written or
  amended, all at one time. This cannot be done with a Bill of Amendment
  in Congress; you would need a separate Bill for each Amendment you
  wish to ratify. This makes an Article V Convention a very risky
  proposition.

Once the Amendment is written, it is distributed to the states to be
**ratified**. 38 states need to ratify the Amendment (or if you're a
"glass half empty" type, 12 states are all that is needed to kill an
Amendment). How the states ratify the Amendment is up to them, but
usually it will be by statewide ballots, just like ballot initiatives
that you would normally see on Election Day.

So now that we've answered the "how" it could happen, let's discuss the
"could" question.

Could Trump try to get Congress to change the 22nd Amendment so that he
could run again? Sure he could. But remember, you need a *supermajority*
of Congress (that means you need 2/3 of *both houses of Congress*) to do
it, and there's a snowball's chance in The Hot Place that that'll ever
happen. The last time Congress agreed on anything was right after 9/11,
and that wasn't even unanimous.

And all changing the 22nd Amendment does is *allow him to* ***run***
*again*. It says nothing about his ability to get *elected* again. You
think the RNC would put him up against a Nikki Haley (if she were to
run)? Heck no, they'd have her in there in a hot second. Trump would
never get the nomination over Haley. I'm sure we're going to have quite
a few Republicans who are more, shall we say, *temperate* than our
current president who will run in 2024. They're already planning on it,
even without Trump being able to run again.

**TL;DR: Trump can certainly ask Congress to amend the Constitution, but
there's little chance they would do it, and all it does is allow him to
run again, and there's even less chance the American people would**
***nominate*** **him a third time, let alone** ***elect*** **him.**
