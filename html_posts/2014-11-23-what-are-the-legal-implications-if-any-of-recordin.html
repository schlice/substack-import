**Content:** [(EDIT: This answer is directed towards the OP who stated
he is outside of the US. Within the US, in certain jurisdictions, it
doesn\'t matter what you do with the recording, you may have violated
the law simply by creating the recording. If you are in the US, check
your local laws before recording a call.)\
\
Depends on what you plan on doing with the recordings and where you plan
on doing it.\
\
As an example, if you plan on using the recordings in a legal
proceeding, the laws vary widely by state. All states require at least
one party to the conversation to be aware that the call is being
recorded. Less than that requires a warrant in all states. Some states
require all parties be aware. Some states require a tone be played every
15 seconds while the recording is in progress.\
\
If you don\'t plan on using the recordings as evidence in a legal
proceeding, you are free to record your own conversations for your own
archival and storage, so long as you are the only person that hears
them. Once others hear them and may act on them, you enter new legal
territory.]{.rendered_qtext}
