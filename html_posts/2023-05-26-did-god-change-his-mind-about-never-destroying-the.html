First, God cannot "change His mind." This implies that God is both not
omnipotent and subject to the constraints of time.

- If God can change His mind, this indicates that before He changed His
  mind, He was lacking some piece of information, then He learned that
  piece of information, and the learning caused Him to change His mind.
  But God is omnipotent, and omnipotence means that He already knows
  everything; He lacks nothing. Therefore, God cannot change His mind.
- Also, this would mean that God is subject to time, because there would
  have to be a time "before" when God thought one way, and then a time
  "after" when God could think a different way. Since God is omnipresent
  and not subject to time, there is no "before" or "after" with God.
  Everything for God is now: the past is now, the present is now, and
  the future is now.

Second, God did not promise to never destroy the world again. God
promised to never *flood* the world again.

> Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him: "I now establish my
> covenant with you and with your descendants after you and with every
> living creature that was with you---the birds, the livestock and all
> the wild animals, all those that came out of the ark with you---every
> living creature on earth. I establish my covenant with you: Never
> again will all life be destroyed by the waters of a flood; never again
> will there be a flood to destroy the earth." --- Genesis 9:8--11 NIV

Quite the opposite to your assertion, God promised that He ***will***
destroy the world again, and the next time He does it, it will be with
***fire***, not water.

The promise that God will destroy the world again was revealed in the
Bible:

> But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will
> disappear with a roar; the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the
> earth and everything done in it will be laid bare.
>
> Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people
> ought you to be? You ought to live holy and godly lives as you look
> forward to the day of God and speed its coming. That day will bring
> about the destruction of the heavens by fire, and the elements will
> melt in the heat. --- 2 Peter 3:10--12 NIV

After the time of the Great Tribulation, the faithful will be
resurrected, and then the earth and everything in it will be destroyed
by fire. This is all revealed in Revelation.
