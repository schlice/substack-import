**Is it true that the president \"cannot obstruct justice because he is
the chief law enforcement officer\"?**

No.

While it is true that the president is the head of the executive branch
under Article II of the Constitution, this does not make the president
immune from obstruction of justice.

For example, President Nixon obstructed justice when he destroyed
evidence, paid hush money, and instructed people to lie. President
Clinton attempted to obstruct justice when he advised potential
witnesses to lie.

I will assume that this question is related to President Trump, and the
accusation by [[certain Democrats that he obstructed
justice](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a6ee32&url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/12/03/dianne_feinstein_sees_possible_obstruction_of_justice_case_against_trump.html){.external_link

the FBI.

**In this context**, **the President cannot be guilty of obstruction of
justice.**

The President has the Constitutional authority as the head of the
executive branch to run that branch as he sees fit, including making
personnel decisions (i.e. hiring and firing people), under Article II of
the Constitution. Therefore, making a personnel decision consistent with
the Constitution ***cannot*** be a crime.

If a law contradicts the Constitution, the *law* is unconstitutional,
not the Constitution.
