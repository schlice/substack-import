Look, I get the tenor of this question. But there's a nugget of
something absolutely useful we can take from this demonstration of
unhinged emotion.

**The liberals have been lied to for so long, and in such a visible way,
that there will be many mental health issues following this election.
The tears from grown men are just the start.**

They simply can't rationalize what they've been told about Trump and
Republicans for so many years with what happened in the election. I
mean, *we've* been telling them, but they could effectively tune us out
because they've been told that they are the intellectual elites and we
are nothing more than sentient pond scum. They've been told that they
are right because they are smarter than us, and they have been handed a
drubbing which they cannot rationalize. It is this internal mental
struggle which is causing these emotional reactions.

It will lead to mental breakdowns nationwide. It will probably lead to
protests, some violent. It will probably lead to workplace violence. And
it will probably lead some to self-harm.

\

*So what do we do?*

We get RFK in as fast as we can, and we make mental health resources
available to these people before they hurt themselves. We need to help
them to process this correctly, and to get them out of this state which
I place squarely at the feet of Democrats and their mouthpieces in the
legacy media.
