**What\'s your security measure to prevent people from stealing your
mail? Does it work?**

I'm going to assume you mean packages. AKA "porch pirates." If you meant
something else, please update us.

Neighbors. They work great.

If you want a more high-tech option for your Amazon deliveries, take a
look at [[Amazon

There are other options too, and I discussed them in a previous answer.
