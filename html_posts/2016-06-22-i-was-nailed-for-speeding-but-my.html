As a general rule, police officers are pretty good at "guessing" speeds.
They spend so much time looking at cars that they can usually reasonably
estimate the speed of a car within a 10 mile per hour bracket.

However, there are several other methods police can employ to obtain
your speed:

1.  If you were on the highway, both vehicle and airborne platforms can
    time your vehicle as it crosses visible markers on the road, and
    that time can be used to calculate your speed. I know from personal
    experience that this system is very accurate, to within the margin
    of error for both speedometers and RADAR units.

    and if used correctly, it can calculate speed to within 2 mph.
2.  If the officer was driving a vehicle, he may have *paced* you.
    Pacing is a technique where the patrol car matches your speed, and
    then the officer simply needs to look at his dashboard to see how
    fast you are going, no RADAR needed.

It's also quite possible that your RADAR/LIDAR detector is simply
malfunctioning. You'd never know unless an officer pointed a RADAR unit
directly at your detector and turned it on.

When I was a cadet at the Air Force Academy, my folks used the money
they were going to spend on my college costs to buy me a car. My fave at
the time was the Ford Thunderbird SC, so they bought me a 1989 model at
auction:

When I was home for Thanksgiving (I was travelling to West Point for the
AF-Army game), I received my gift. During that time, we tested out the
car and the new radar detector on Ocean Parkway, which is along the
barrier beaches on Long Island. Literally deserted highway, so we could
really open it up and see what it does.

When we were stopped, the officer said he clocked us at 148. When we
told him the radar detector didn't even blip, he took out his handheld
unit and, standing at the hood of the car, blasted it directly at the
detector. Nothing.

The moral of the story is you will probably never know that your radar
detector isn't working correctly unless an officer blasts his radar gun
at you to test it.
