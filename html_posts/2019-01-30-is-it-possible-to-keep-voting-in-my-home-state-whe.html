**Is it possible to keep voting in my home state when I can\'t attend
jury duty?**

This is a question of state residency, not a voting question. Which
state you can vote in is based on which state is your **state of
residence**, while jury duty is based on which state provides your
**driver's license**, which is a secondary function to which state is
your state of residence.

The voting question is the simple one. You vote in your state of
residence, pure and simple. If you're not going to be there during the
election, you contact your county clerk's office, you advise them you
will be out of state during the election, and they send you an *absentee
ballot* which will allow you to vote through the mail.

The residency question is more complicated. It's interesting, because
most states use the IRS' determination of state residency to determine
whether or not you are a resident of a state. To that end, please allow
me to quote from TurboTax's website about moving and state residency
(emphasis mine). In your case, you'll want to follow as many of the
bullets as you can to prove your permanent residency in your home state
despite spending more time in your new state simply for work:

> The truth is that it\'s often easier to become a permanent resident in

> - Don\'t move your family to the new state.

So it's less important how long you're in the new state for work. It's
more important *where you declare your state of residency*, and that you
intend for your home state to *remain* your state of residency. What's
most important is what you do to show that you are only *temporarily* in
the new state, as opposed to the old state.
