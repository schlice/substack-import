***While I may have moral and religious objections to certain facets of
IVF, it is patently not "creating life."***

That's like plugging your computer into your router and claiming you
"created" the Internet.

Creating a life is immensely more complex than just sticking a
pre-fertilized egg into a uterus and hoping it attaches. Only God
creates life.

Again, don't get me wrong, there are indeed facets of IVF which any
Christian should rightly find objectionable; namely, what is done with
all of the remaining embryos which are not implanted. But let's not
throw the baby out with the bathwater...er...yeah. Anyway, the point is
that IVF should not be confused with the massive amount of knowledge it
would take to create life. Humans absolutely cannot create life, despite
how hard evolutionists have tried. And IVF doesn't "create life" any
more than connecting your router and your computer "creates" the
Internet.
