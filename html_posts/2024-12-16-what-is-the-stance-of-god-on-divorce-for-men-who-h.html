**If you think that divorce is always an option, then don't bother
getting married.**

The Bible is abundantly clear about this point.

> *and said, 'Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and
> hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh'? So they
> are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined
> together, let not man separate." \-- Matthew 19:5--6 ESV*

This is Jesus, quoting Genesis. Note what it says: the two shall become
one flesh. They are no longer two, but one.

More importantly is the next line: **what God has joined together, let
not man separate.**

There is literally only one scenario in which divorce is even
contemplated: marital infidelity. Beyond that, divorce isn't a thing God
endorses.

Everyone, men and women alike, have the choice to marry or remain
single. No one is forced to marry. But by the same token, no one should
be flippant about marriage. You marry for life. You marry the person who
you will work with, because life isn't perfect. Marriage is hard.

The tenor of your question makes it sound like you believe that only men
have the right to seek divorce. That may be the stance of some other
religions, but Christianity does not believe this. The words of Jesus
were very clear on this point.

What God has joined, man must not divide.
