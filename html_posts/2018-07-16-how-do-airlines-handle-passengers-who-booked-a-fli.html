The airlines will usually have aircraft of the same type or similar
which can be rotated in due to routine mechanical failure. The same
action would occur if an airframe were out of commission because of a
mechanical issue as would occur due to a complete airframe loss.

If the airline cannot get a replacement airframe rotated in in time,
they will cancel the flight, which would cause the passengers to be
re-booked on another flight. If the airline could not re-book the
passengers onto suitable flights within their own airline, they would
transfer tickets to other airlines which could accommodate the
passengers' schedules.
