No, there's really no catch.

The rub is that **they won't take a case they can't win**, because they
won't work for free. **If they take your case, they can either win, or
they can win a reduced settlement,** but they'll get something.

Even if they have to settle for less than you originally thought you
could get, they're still taking a third of that. The agreement you sign
says that if you win a settlement, the attorney keeps 1/3 of that
settlement, and you keep 2/3. If you don't win any settlement, you don't
owe the attorney anything.

Here's a real-life example. One of my family members was involved in an
auto accident. Ahead of our vehicle (about 10 cars ahead), an elderly
woman ran a red light and turned left into oncoming traffic. This was
immediately followed by much slamming of brakes and many rear-end
accidents. My family member was able to stop with only minor contact to
the vehicle ahead. The driver behind her was not so attentive. He
slammed into the back of our car. Police investigation revealed that
based on the skid marks, he was traveling at at least 55 mph when he
impacted our car. Her back was seriously injured.

We hired a personal injury attorney in our city. He did a great job, but
because my family member's car impacted the car ahead of it before she
was struck from the rear, the attorney for the driver behind
successfully argued that the damages my family member should receive
should be reduced because you cannot reasonably tell how much injury was
caused by the first collision and the second.

I call bullshit on that one, but I'm not the judge, am I...

Nevertheless, we were expecting to be awarded around \$40,000 in
damages. We were only awarded around \$18,000 in damages, which meant we
only got \$12,000 back. So instead of my attorney earning around
\$13,000, he only earned around \$6,000. Covered his expenses and some
profit, but hardly what he was hoping for.
