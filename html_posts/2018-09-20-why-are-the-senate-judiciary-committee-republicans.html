**Why are the Senate Judiciary Committee Republicans rejecting any
request by Ford to have an FBI investigation?**

Because the Senate Judiciary Committee has no authority to ask the FBI
to do anything. Nether does Ford.

The FBI, in this case, works for the White House, not for Congress.

Think of it this way. The White House asks the FBI to do background
checks on potential SCOTUS nominees. The FBI does these checks, but they
don't routinely investigate the veracity of any derogatory claims. They
simply forward the packet on to the White House for the President to use
in his decision to nominate a SCOTUS justice. Therefore, the FBI would
not unilaterally investigate anyone who was not accused of committing a
Federal crime, and in this case, no one has been.

If the Senate Judiciary Committee is advised of a crime which had taken
place, then they can request the FBI investigate a crime. But the Senate
Judiciary Committee has no authority to demand that the FBI re-open a
background investigation ordered by the White House when it was
successfully completed.

Twice.

If the White House wants to re-open the background investigation (which
President Trump has said he does not want to do), they can do so. Beyond
that, the FBI, Congress, or Ford has no authority to do so on their own.

Besides, the FBI already reviewed the letter by Ford and stated that
there is nothing in it for them to investigate, as there is no Federal
crime alleged, and their background investigation is already complete.
