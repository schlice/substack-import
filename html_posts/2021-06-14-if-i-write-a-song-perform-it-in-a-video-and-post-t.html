First of all, as soon as you write a song, you have a copyright over it.
It is yours, and no one can legally copy it.

The problem is *protecting your work*. The way to do that is to file for
copyright protection. [[This

go through to register your song's copyright. ***That*** would be enough
to protect your rights so that no one can reuse your music.

Recording your song on YouTube is not enough to protect your rights.
Filing for copyright protection is.

Original question:

If I write a song, perform it in a video, and post that video on
YouTube, would that be enough to protect my rights so that people know I
wrote it?
