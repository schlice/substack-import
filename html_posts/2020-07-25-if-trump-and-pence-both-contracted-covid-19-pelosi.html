**If Trump and Pence both contracted Covid 19, Pelosi would become
President. Would she be able to nominate someone to the Supreme Court?**

If Trump and Pence both contracted COVID-19, they'd both have to die
from it before Pelosi would become President.

In the few months she'd have until the election, RBG would have to
retire, Pelosi would have to nominate a successor, and then the Senate
would have to give its advice and consent.

I'd bet dollars to donuts that the Senate would not provide advice
and/or consent, or if they did, they would surely vote no. McConnell
would pull the same trick he did with Merrick Garland, and the nominee
wouldn't even make it to the floor for a vote. He'd say that Pelosi
wasn't an elected president, so he'd wait until the next elected
president in November nominates someone.
