As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."

In the ***vast*** majority of cases, the answer is absolutely no. The
First Amendment and the Supremacy Clause makes certain of that. No law
shall be made which abridges the free exercise of religion.

But since there are always exceptions, here's one. While landlords
cannot discriminate based on religion, they can implement reasonable
rules regarding property use that *might impact* religious practices,
**as long as these rules are not specifically targeting a particular
religion** and are applied equally to all tenants. So you can't bypass
the landlord's rules just because you're practicing religion, so long as
the rule applies to all tenants regardless of whether or not they are
practicing religion.
