**Is it true that Stephen was the first recorded martyr in the history
of Christendom?**

St. Stephen is indeed the first recorded Christian martyr. He was the
first person recorded to be killed for his Christian faith, stoned to
death in the year 36 AD.

Stephen was one of the first deacons of the early church, a leadership
position defined in the Bible along with elders. Stephen often engaged
in religious discussions in the synagogue, which caught the attention of
the Sanhedrin. He was brought before them, and his defense of his faith
so enraged them that he was brought out of the city and stoned to death.
His last words echo the last words of Jesus on the cross:

> Then he fell on his knees and cried out, "Lord, do not hold this sin
> against them." When he had said this, he fell asleep. ---Acts 7:60

This echoes what Jesus said:

> Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are
> doing." --- Luke 23:34
