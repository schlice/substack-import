This is nothing more than fluff news and sensationalist, sloppy
reporting.

This statement is patently **false.**

There is no affirmative duty to report in the United States. You can
know of a crime and do nothing about it, and you are not in violation of
the law. As distasteful as that sounds, this is how law in nearly every
state is written.

Some professions do have a duty to report, based on the profession
itself. But the average citizen is under no legal obligation to report a
crime.

If, instead of doing nothing before the crime, you assisted the criminal
in any way in the furtherance of the crime, you could be charged as an
***accessory to the original crime.***

Additionally, you cannot **interfere** with the investigation of a
crime. If you attempt to cover up or conceal a crime, or to aid the
criminal in his flight from justice, this is a separate crime called
***aiding and abetting***.

According to the article, she drove with him to the club, and she went
with him to buy ammunition and a holster. All of these activities are
perfectly legal. However, simply failing to report the crime is not
illegal.

Simply sloppy reporting.
