**Can I be prosecuted if I walk into (and use) a gym where I'm not a
member, if the staff don't notice what I'm doing?**

You qualified your crime with "if the staff don't notice what I'm
doing." So you're trying to say *it's only a crime if you get caught,*
right?

Well technically, that's not true. It's a crime, whether or not you get
caught.

The crimes include trespassing and theft of service. Trespassing would
be for being present on private property without permission, and theft
of service would be using the gym for which you did not pay the
appropriate fee to use.

You did ask if you can be prosecuted if the staff didn't notice what you
were doing. So you're trying to claim that if you do get caught, you
can't be prosecuted because the staff didn't detect your presence or
your theft. However, the definition of the crime does not include
detection by the staff.

In other words, it's still a crime, even if the staff doesn't see you.
If evidence is produced that you did what you were accused of doing, you
can still be prosecuted, even if the staff didn't notice what you were
doing.
