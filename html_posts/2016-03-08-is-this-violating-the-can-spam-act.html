**Content:** [You should be able to unsubscribe without logging in, but
the CAN-SPAM Act does not discuss specifics of how websites should
operate. It talks about how mailing lists should be entered, that people
should always maintain control over their membership, mailing lists
should be \"opt-in\" instead of \"opt-out\" as their first order of
business, and people should have control over their mailing list
preferences at all times.\
\
Have you tried the opposite tactic? Try staying away from the mailing
list section, and instead try to sign up for an account at the site,
which should tell you that you already have one. Then use the \"Forgot
Password\" link to reset your password.\
\
The site should have a way to contact them (usually at the bottom). Try
to contact them if the above fails.\
\
If all of this fails and you still believe the site is operating in
violation of spam laws, contact the Attorney General\'s office in your
state. They handle spam issues for the residents of their
state.]{.rendered_qtext}
