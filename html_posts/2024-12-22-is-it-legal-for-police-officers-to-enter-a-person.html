As with **ALL** legal questions, the answer is "it depends."

In some cases, police can enter your home without permission and without
knocking. Primarily, this is during *exigent circumstances.*

Exigent circumstances, as defined in [[*United States v.
McConney*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=da6e94&url=https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-mcconney){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="casetext.com"}]{.qlink_container} are \"circumstances that
would cause a reasonable person to believe that entry (or other relevant
prompt action) was necessary to prevent physical harm to the officers or
other persons, the destruction of relevant evidence, the escape of the
suspect, or some other consequence improperly frustrating legitimate law
enforcement efforts.\"

Some examples of exigent circumstances include:

- Someone in the house who, when heard from the outside, is in apparent
  danger or needs medical assistance
- Someone in the house is wanted in a serious crime and is at risk of
  flight
- Someone in the house is in possession of evidence known by the police
  due to an active investigation and the potential exists that
  announcing themselves will give the person enough time to destroy the
  evidence

You want to *prevent* the police from being able to do this? First, good
luck. Second, and here's the truth: **you can never spend enough money
to** ***prevent*** **the police from breaking in if they are determined
to do so.**

In my home town when I was growing up, the police literally drove a tow
truck through a ranch style home's picture window to catch a drug
dealer.

*(This is not the tow truck, but it is similar to this one. Just imagine
diamond pattern stair-step fender flares on the front, and you get the
idea)*

After driving the truck through the front wall of the house, officers
used that stair-step fender flare on either side of the truck to enter
the drug dealer's house. The drug dealer's armed henchman in the front
room *literally* pooed his pants.

Point is, you can try to fortify your home enough to prevent the police
from getting in if they want, but it's unlikely you'll be able to do so.

Instead, save your money and retain a good lawyer, because if the police
didn't have probable cause or exigent circumstances, any entry without a
warrant makes anything found in the house inadmissible in court.
