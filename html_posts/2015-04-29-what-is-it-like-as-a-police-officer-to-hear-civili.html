**Content:** [Thanks for the A2A.\
\
Before I get into my answer, I want to comment on the video clip you
posted, which is not necessarily the question I answered. The people
rioting in Baltimore are not \"peaceful protesters\" unjustly abused by
police. They are **criminals** and everyone from the President on down
has said so. They attack the police, and if you attack a cop, you
deserve what you get. Don\'t want to be abused by the police? Start by
not attacking them.\
\
There is not a single incidence of true police brutality that doesn\'t
break my heart. When you see a cop dishonor his oath, it literally,
physically hurts to watch.\
\
But lately, *every* use of force has been splayed across your electronic
screens, and not all of them should have. Especially in our current
cameras-everywhere-instant-news-hyperaware culture, any incident which
someone deems to be even the slightest bit violent ends up \"going
viral\" and contributes to the ongoing narrative of \"See, there\'s
those brutal cops again.\"\
\
If there are true bad cops out there (and there are some), I\'d like to
personally throw them a blanket party. If you don\'t know what that is,
ask one of your military (or former military) friends.\
\
But we also need to be honest with ourselves. What you see in a
10-second video clip is not \"the whole story.\" It never is. There is
always something else that contributes to why what you are seeing in the
clip is happening. And it is all the things that you *don\'t* see that
go towards **justification**. The court uses the entirety of the
circumstances to determine if there was justification in what the
officer did. Did he fear for his life? Did he have to protect the safety
of the general public? What happened before the clip that led to the
officer\'s decisions?\
\
Now please don\'t respond to me with a clip and incredulously ask me if
I think it\'s justified. I\'m not on the grand jury. I\'m not in the
officer\'s chain of command. I\'m not doing the UOF (use of force)
review. But you must understand that ***every time*** a police officer
uses ***ANY*** level of force in any situation, he must complete a Use
Of Force form which is reviewed along with the incident reports from
every officer on the scene. Every reported injury to a suspect is
documented and is tied back to the UOF form and the incident reports.
Any bump or bruise that is missing is questioned. Any video surveillance
is added to the body of evidence used during a UOF review. If charges
need to be brought, the case is turned over to the District Attorney. If
administrative punishments need to be handed out, they are, as the
officer\'s chain of command is involved in the UOF review. There are
also representatives from the Training division of the department, so
that if a training deficiency is seen, training can be developed or
augmented to train (or re-train) officers.\
\
The police take this stuff seriously. The legal system takes this stuff
seriously. The fact that you don\'t see the behind-the-scenes reviews
that police do EVERY. TIME. force is used doesn\'t mean it doesn\'t
exist, or that police don\'t care. Perhaps we should pressure Dateline
or 20/20 to do an expos√© on police department administration. But they
won\'t, because it\'s boring. It\'s administrative. Everyone wants to
know about it, but no one wants to see it.\
\
And please don\'t respond to me that the police can\'t police
themselves. Everyone has heard of \"Internal Affairs.\" Those are the
cops that police the cops. TV likes to portray IA as the cops that no
one likes, because they come down on cops who are just trying to do
their jobs. There may be some truth to that sentiment, but for the most
part, IA is doing the internal investigations into police officer
misconduct that finds the bad cops and directs re-training, reprimands
them or recommends their discharge. For that, we are grateful. It\'s one
less blanket party I have to throw.\
\
If there are true instances of police brutality out there, it truly
sickens me. Those officers \"tarnish the badge\" and make an already
uncomfortable situation worse. However, in truth, those incidents are
few and far between when compared with the number of times officers have
to use force. They do happen, but they are very closely monitored, and
if action is needed to be taken, it is.\
\
I think officers tend to get defensive about this because people tend to
*generalize*. They see one incident of an officer\'s poor behavior and
generalize that behavior across every officer who has ever worn, or who
will ever wear, a badge. They see one officer behave inappropriately and
they say, \"all officers behave badly; I\'m going to disobey officers
from now on, for my own safety\" instead of saying, \"wow, glad we found
that one bad apple and sent him to jail.\" Should I look at students who
shoot up high schools and say, \"all high school students behave badly,
we need to have full body searches of all students who walk into high
schools because they all are about to shoot up their schools\"? Of
course you wouldn\'t think that. But people make that generalization
about police officers every day, and the media is their willing
accomplice. More and more people are routinely disobeying police
officers\' directives because they are foolish enough to believe that if
they comply, something bad will happen. In actuality, it is exactly the
opposite: failure to comply will lead to bad stuff happening, so it is
their misguided beliefs that end up getting them in trouble. Just look
at this question:\
\
[[Get on the ground! Do it now! Why should I comply with
this?](https://www.quora.com/Why-should-I-comply-when-a-police-officer-says-Get-on-the-ground-Do-it-now/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container}\
\
I would never stop to think \"Hmm, an officer is telling me to get on
the ground in a very loud voice. I\'m unsure if I should comply with
this directive.\" But this, clearly, (even by this very question), is
where people\'s minds are going. This makes for a very dangerous and
volatile situation for police officers. Not only do we have to deal with
the nutjobs and fruit-loops of society who won\'t follow directions
because their \"alien overlords in the mothership\" are directing them
to, and I should just look them up in the \"universal computer\" (btw:
real statements from real fruit-loops), but now we have to deal with
regular (non-crazy) citizens who believe with all their heart that
following the law will get you hurt. Thanks, mass media.\
\
I predict that you will see an uptick in the use of non-lethal force,
like the TASER. Sadly, officers will spend brain cycles questioning
their decision to use deadly force in situations requiring the use of
force. It\'s sad because more officers will be killed because of their
indecision. Fewer citizens will die, but more officers will. Is that an
acceptable trade-off for you?]{.rendered_qtext}
