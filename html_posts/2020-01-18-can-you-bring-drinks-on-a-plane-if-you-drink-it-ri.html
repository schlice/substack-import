**Can you bring drinks on a plane if you drink it right in front of the
TSA agent\'s face to prove that it\'s a drink?**

First of all, the problem isn't bringing drinks on a plane. The problem
is bringing drinks through the security checkpoint. You can bring drinks
on a plane; you just have to buy them inside the sterile area.

Wanna hear the cool logic about why not?

If I'm a suicide bomber, and I want to use a liquid bomb, I'll be happy
to drink some of the liquid in front of you.

Because I'm going to die in a horrible mid-air explosion anyway. So
what's a little bit of poison before I die?

If I'm truly committed to the cause, I'd be *happy* to drink poison in
front of you.

So that's the logic.

But here's the good news: you can bring *empty bottles* through the
security checkpoint and fill them once you get inside. Many large
airports have "bottle stations" which deliver filtered water straight
into your bottle.

Some even have integrated drinking stations built in to them:

So you can still get water without having to bring it through security.
