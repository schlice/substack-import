Interesting case here, considering that the prosecution also found there
was no intent (which was the FBI's contention in Mrs. Clinton's case as
well). In this case, the person was convicted to prison and fined for
releasing classified materials, and there was no evidence that the
materials were compromised. In Mrs. Clinton's case, there is evidence
that the materials were compromised, and she was not prosecuted.

This may have more to do with DOJ's written guidance which states that
we don't prosecute candidates because we don't criminalize politics, nor
do we want to give the appearance that we criminalize politics. That
kind of stuff happens in third world countries, not in the US.
