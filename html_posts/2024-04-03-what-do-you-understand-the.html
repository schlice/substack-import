The answer is in Revelation, primarily in Revelation 13, and it is
related to the "end times," the times when the Great Deceiver will unite
all the nations of the world. He will appear to be a savior, but he will
actually be Satan. He's sometimes referred to as "the Antichrist." He
will also be assisted by the "false prophet," and it is this being who
forces everyone to take the mark. It will include something visible to
everyone, either on the right hand or on the forehead.

Revelation tells us that he will make everyone take a mark in order to
participate in financial transactions in society. In order to buy or
sell in the new world, you will have to take the mark. It will only be
given to those who worship the Antichrist.

People have been worried that many modern-day items could be the mark.
Some are worried about RFID chips in the hand, and are claiming them to
be the mark. They are not. They may be part of what will ultimately
become the mark, but simply having a microchip embedded in your hand is
not, in itself, the mark. Remember that the mark is something visible on
the hand or head, not just a card that you carry, and the mark is only
given to those who worship the Antichrist, who is a single entity. Some
people were worried about the COVID-19 vaccine, or "vaccine passports,"
being the mark; they are not. But the idea is headed in the same
direction as the mark. However, the mark will be something visible, on
the right hand or on the forehead, and it will be affirmatively given
only to those who freely worship the Antichrist.

2 Thessalonians tells us that we will know who the Antichrist is when he
is revealed. So we are certainly not there yet. Also, when he is
revealed, it will be clear how the number 666 relates to him, so we can
use that to dispel the idea that any of our current national leaders are
the Antichrist. Our friends at

events detailed in 2 Thessalonians which will herald the time of the
Antichrist:

> First, there will be \"the rebellion.\" This likely means an overt and
> extreme revolt against truth. The word translated \"rebellion\" can
> also be translated, \"the falling away,\" \"the apostasy,\" or \"the
> departure.\" The use of a definite article---\"the\" in English, from
> *hÄ“* in Greek---attached to the word for \"rebellion\" indicates a
> specific event previously mentioned in the passage. It may refer to
> Israel\'s revolt against Old Testament teaching when the nation turns
> to idolatry. Perhaps it refers to the state of the world following the
> departure of the church due to the rapture. It is noteworthy that Paul
> describes the rapture in verse 1 as \"*the* coming of our Lord Jesus
> Christ and our being gathering together to him.\"
>
> The second event Paul mentions in verse 3 is the appearance of \"the
> man of lawlessness,\" \"the son of destruction.\" Based on the
> description of this man\'s activities, it seems probable that he is
> one of the two infamous figures described in Revelation 13. God will
> punish the man of lawlessness by consigning him to eternal punishment
> in the lake of fire (Revelation 19:20--21).
