It's not quite that easy, but the number one way to get viruses on your
devices is by opening attachments in emails, or visiting
questionable/unknown websites.

And it's especially more difficult on a mobile device, unless you've
jailbroken/rooted your device.

If there's ever any question whether or not there is malware on your
phone, **reset your device.**

First, before you reset your device, make sure your backups are in
place. On iPhone, you should be backing up your device to iCloud. Make
sure you're signed in and backing up. For Android devices, make sure
you're backing up to Google. On current Android versions, it's under
**Settings \> Accounts and backup.**

Once that's done, reset your device:

- On iPhone, it's under **Settings \> General \> Reset**. Follow the
  instructions and choose "Erase All Content and Settings." The device
  will make sure you have a current backup before you proceed.
- On Android, it's under **Settings \> General Management \> Reset**.
  Follow the instructions. While Android won't ensure you have a current
  backup before you proceed, you should first ensure you have taken the
  step from before and created a full backup.

Once your phone wipes itself and re-installs the operating system, log
back into your online account (iCloud or Google), and as part of the
setup process, you will be given the option to restore your device from
one of your backups.

Malware applications aren't installed from the approved app stores, so
any malware will be erased.

Original question:

Can you put malware on someone's phone by sending an email and me
opening it? My crazy boyfriend said he did that and now he can listen to
all my conversations.
