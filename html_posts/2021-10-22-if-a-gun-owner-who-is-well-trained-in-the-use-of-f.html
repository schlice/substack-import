***TRIGGER WARNING:*** *Truth Bombs Inbound! If you subscribe to this
glorified notion of concealed carriers saving the day for you, this
answer will likely trigger you:*

Gun owners who are also concealed carriers carry weapons for **their own
protection** and **the protection of their families.**

Gun owners who are also concealed carriers **DO NOT** carry weapons **to
protect other people.**

Concealed carriers are not self-appointed public servants who shoot at
others when they are not threatened. That's called *assault* and if they
kill that person, that's called *murder.*

Granted, their criminal sentence might be reduced (or possibly
eliminated) if they saved the lives of others, if public opinion is
clearly in favor of the concealed carrier, and if the District Attorney
is feeling especially generous, but they are certainly not outside the
fiscal reach of the alleged criminal's family, and they would most
certainly be sued for wrongful death. Police officers are protected by
*qualified immunity* from such lawsuits, but citizen concealed carriers
are not. And I don't have the money to pay millions in a wrongful death
suit to the estate of the alleged criminal.

And don't think for one second that the family of the alleged criminal
(note he's only an alleged criminal because he is dead and never had the
opportunity to be adjudicated a criminal) won't breathlessly portray him
as a saint who would never hurt a fly and there must be some reason he
was there with a gun, and blah blah blah. It happened in the case of
Michael Brown in Ferguson, MO. Michael used his size to intimidate a
shopkeeper, but after he was shot by police (when he tried to do the
same to the officer), his family painted him as "the gentle giant" who
would never hurt a soul. One of these descriptions is accurate, and one
is an embellishment. They can't both be accurate.

When you take a concealed carry class, you are taught one very important
phrase which should stick with you when you carry: "Every bullet you
fire has a lawyer attached to it." In other words, you had better be
*ultra sure* you are only employing your firearm **because you are in
fear for your own life**, or you are in fear for your family's life.
Because if you fire a gun at a person in any other situation, while you
may not ultimately go to jail, **you will be sued**. And you may lose.

Otherwise, the other victims should probably have bought their own guns,
gone through the process to get their own CC permits, and should have
been protecting themselves, not relying on the kindness of strangers or
the timely response of the police.

I will say this: Yes, defense of others is a valid form of self defense
in most states, but I am not ready to become the legal guinea pig in
this story.

That said: **IF** circumstances are absolutely perfect, and **IF** a
mass shooter is simply walking around the vicinity mindlessly gunning
people down, and **IF** I have excellent cover, and **IF** my family is
safe, and **IF** have the perfect shot, I would *consider* taking it.
But no guarantees. It would have to be the ideal situation before I
stepped in **with my personal carry gun** to intervene. And even then, I
do so at great risk to myself. There's a good chance I'll be arrested,
and probably just as fair a chance that I'll be released later, but I'd
have to be willing to take that risk.

Most of the time, I wouldn't.

**TL;DR:** *My priority as a concealed carrier is to protect myself and
my family.*

Original question:

If a gun owner who is well trained in the use of firearms happen to be
in the vicinity of a mass shooting, should the gun owner attempt to be a
hero and try to shoot the shooter or should he let the police deal with
the situation?
