**Emergency First Responders - What should a civilian do when they see a
car accident?**

If you can assist *safely*, please do assist. However, remember you're
not in an emergency vehicle. You don't have bright flashing lights on
your car that can notify other drivers that something out of the
ordinary is happening in traffic. You must be vigilant while you're
assisting.

So here's a quick checklist on what you should do when you arrive at the
scene of an accident:

- **Make sure you can assist safely**. It helps no one if you get hurt
  while you're trying to help someone else.
- Next, **call 911**. Explain the situation as best you can and stay on
  the phone and on the scene if you can until the police arrive.
- **Don't move anyone** unless they can move on their own, or unless
  their life is in danger by leaving them in place (i.e. the car is on
  fire or they're lying in traffic). Otherwise, treat them in place.
- **Make sure everyone can breathe and there's no spurting blood**.
  Remember the Four B's: **breathing, bleeding, breaks,** and **burns.**
  Treat in that order. They may be bleeding from a cut but if they can't
  breathe they'll be dead before you can stop the bleeding. [[The four

- Stay with them and keep 911 informed as to any changes.
