**Can an expired HOA have the right to govern homeowners association
members?**

I don't understand what an "expired HOA" is.

HOAs are governed by covenants and governing documents, and the
covenants are incorporated by the City and become part of City Charter.

Like a Constitutional Amendment, the only way to terminate an HOA is by
filing another amendment to the covenants with the city, and the only
way to do that is through (usually) unanimous vote of the homeowners
(although some cities and states have different rules about that, it
could be a supermajority of homeowners).

So there is either an HOA, or there is no HOA. HOAs do not "expire."

It sounds like you're looking for a loophole to invalidate something the
HOA told you to do. Bottom line: if you live in an area controlled by an
HOA, the HOA has a "controlling interest" in your property, and you
gotta do what they tell you or they can fine you. Don't pay the fine and
they can put a lien on your house. Let it go long enough, and they can
foreclose on your lien. That means they sell your house out from under
you, and you're no longer a homeowner.
