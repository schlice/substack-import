DNA.

DNA is a message. It's what we call *specified complexity.* DNA contains
the equivalent of 1,000 encyclopedias of specific information, **in the
smallest single-celled organism.**

Science has shown us that messages are only created by intelligence.
Messages are not created by random chemical interactions. Messages only
come from mind.

***If there is a message, there must be a message-giver.***

We know that human beings were intelligently designed.

We know that the universe was not the intelligent designer, because the
universe is not eternal. The universe had a beginning. Therefore, the
universe must have had a *beginner*, or someone to create it. Either the
universe is eternal and uncaused, or the universe had a beginning and a
cause. Can't be both. It's either/or.

Therefore, God must exist.
