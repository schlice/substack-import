**What is the difference between a Christian and a Mormon in terms of
beliefs, and are they similar?**

First, Christianity is different from *every other religion in the
world* in that Christianity is the only world religion which says that
there is nothing you can do to earn your salvation, only grace saves
you. Every other world religion, including Mormonism, says that there is
something you must do in order to earn your salvation.

Additionally, Mormonism *is not* Christian. There are many ways in which
Mormonism lies in direct contrast with the Bible, but they explain that
this is because the Bible was translated inaccurately. They believe that
the Book of Mormon is a more complete teaching, and that the Book of
Mormon is more correct than the Bible. If you want to really determine
the orthodoxy of any particular religion, just look at how they view
Jesus. Just ask them the question, "Who do you say Jesus is?" Mormons
view Jesus as divine, but not deity. They view Jesus as exemplary, a
great teacher, but not as a penal substitution for our sins. These are
core Christian beliefs. Mormonism doesn't believe in *sola fides* (only
grace saves you), they believe in faith AND works. They don't believe in
*sola Scriptura* (God's word is only in the Bible), they believe in the
Bible AND another book. There are more examples, but these are a few.

There are many varied differences between Mormonism and Christianity,
and they are well documented. I don't need to go through them here. Feel
free to look them up at your leisure. Suffice it to say that they are
vastly different in what they believe, but the main differences are the
way you gain salvation and belief in Jesus as God.

*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.
Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a
civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not
misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously. My mental well-being
isn\'t worth your harassing, inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I
wrote, tough shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is
un-cited opinion masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m
wrong, write your own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site,
not a debate site. If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually,
you\'re wrong,\" don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment.
Put anything vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be
followed by a block and a mute. I will do this immediately and with no
compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*

*In this specific case, please don't bother trying to tell me that
Mormons don't believe what I said because something-or-other isn't in an
"official" Mormon teaching. If it's not in a Church-sanctioned book,
fine. But why have Mormon apostles and high officials written them and
taught them? Why are they still, to this day, sold in Mormon bookstores?
Why hasn't the official Church leadership come out and denounced them?
Mormons are taught these things, with or without tacit approval from the
Church leadership.*
