**Can you still have someone arrested for sexual assault even if it was
38 years ago?**

The answer, as with all legal questions, is "it depends."

The statute of limitations is different in each state. You must check
the law in the state in which you plan on filing charges.

The statute may change based on the age of the victim at the time of the
crime and other factors.

In general, unless the victim was underage, the statute of limitations
is usually not longer than 10 years. However, your mileage may vary.

I suggest you contact the district attorney's office if you have
questions about whether or not they can file charges.
