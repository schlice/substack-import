Most commercial pepper sprays have as their active ingredient *oleoresin
capsicum* (OC), which is the oil from hot peppers. That's why it is
called "pepper spray." The oil is suspended in an inert fluid along with
a propellant in the can. It sprays out in a stream and can usually reach
10 to 15 feet from the sprayer.

For most people, it's very painful, and the effects are relatively long
lasting, as the oil is difficult to remove from skin without solvents.
