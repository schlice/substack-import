The State Department isn't changing its policy or the implementation of
its policies. This policy started under the Obama administration.

The official policy targets people whose birth certificates show they
were delivered by midwives near the southern border. Midwives have
historically been a very large source of fraudulent birth certificates,
claiming a child was born in the United States when they were actually
born in Mexico.

When the State Department sees a passport application from someone born
in the Rio Grande Valley accompanied by a birth certificate issued by a
suspected midwife, or applications which come from people who have both
a US and a foreign birth certificate, they often ask for supporting
information (which is very common in passport applications). In this
case, the supporting information may be information about your
childhood: what neighborhood you lived in as a child, what elementary
school you attended.

Denials are **not** a Constitutional rights issue. The rights protected
by the Constitution are *natural rights*, they exist simply because you
are human. You do not have a "right" to a passport. You must be a US
citizen in order to receive a passport, and you must establish positive
proof that you are a US citizen. It is not unconstitutional to prove
that you are a citizen by birth.

This problem is not an easy one to solve. It is nearly impossible to
tell if the birth certificate itself is fake, as they were all issued by
the state of Texas decades ago. It falls to supporting documentation to
help prove you were born in the United States, and not in Mexico.
Additionally, the midwives who issued fake birth certificates also
issued thousands of real ones, so it's nearly inevitable that some
actual US citizens are going to be swept up in the process. And
sometimes, you'll find the case of a US citizen who was denied a
passport because their supporting documentation didn't hold up to State
Department scrutiny. And once the media finds one or two of those,
[[they turn the issue into a
shitshow](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=fe77bd&url=https://www.texastribune.org/2018/08/29/us-denying-passports-americans-along-border-throwing-their-citizenship/){.external_link

denials are reversed when supporting documentation is provided, and the
rest go to court and most are found in favor of the petitioner.
