If you don't even call your PO and tell him what the doctor said, then
maybe he'll try to revoke you for failing to report. But if you at least
work with him and tell him that your doctor ordered bed rest, revoking
you for not reporting would be something you could appeal to the Parole
Board. So long as you can show that you tried to work with the PO and
he's being stupid about it, you should be fine.
