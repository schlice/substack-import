**If I rent my property and the tenants are busted for growing
marijuana, is the landlord responsible for criminal activities?**

Not for the criminal activities of the tenants.

It's like saying the owner of the car is responsible for the killing of
pedestrians when the driver of the car plows it into a crowd.

Don't forget, there are always exceptions to this. For example, if the
landlord knew what was going on and did nothing (which is common in grow
operations), or actually assisted the tenants with fulfilling their
illegal activities (perhaps by installing upgraded power in the rental
unit to safely run grow lights and air handlers) the landlord could be
charged with a different charge, not the illegal grow. For example, the
landlord could be charged with "aiding and abetting" criminal activity,
or could be charged as an accessory to the crime, depending on his level
of involvement with the tenants. These are both criminal charges, but
they are different from being charged with the actual crime.
