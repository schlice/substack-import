**So the Republican heavy Supreme Court just blocked the release of
parts of the Mueller report until after the election. Why could that
be?**

Ignoring the bias in your question (as if the election is why they
decided as they did), that's actually what exactly did not happen.

In fact, SCOTUS issued a *temporary* stay on the order to release the
grand jury material from Mueller's special counsel investigation until
June 1 (hardly past the election), to give the White House and the DOJ
time to file a full appeal. The DOJ argued that they would suffer
"irreparable harm" if the documents were released before they had an
opportunity to file their appeal.

The short timeline indicates that the justices are going to decide,
during this term, whether or not they will take up the case.

And if they do, during this term, it will take *months* for them to
render a decision, which will actually mean that the documents will not
be released until after the election[\[1\]](#bkSpf){#cite-bkSpf
