**Can the US Congress issue arrest warrants for those who ignore
subpoenas and refuse to testify during the Trump impeachment
proceedings?**

Not directly, but there is a process by which they can have offenders
arrested.

Historically, Congress has used its own authority to arrest those in
contempt of Congress, though very infrequently.

Today, a Congressional subcommittee seeking to enforce a subpoena would
deliver that subpoena to the US Attorney's Office (usually the one in DC
is used) and a hearing would be scheduled. Attorneys from both sides
would be heard, and the judge would rule first on the validity and
enforce-ability of the subpoena, and then on whether or not the
respondent can be compelled to comply with the subpoena.

After a favorable ruling, the respondent will have a certain amount of
time to comply. Failure to comply at that point could result in a bench
warrant.
