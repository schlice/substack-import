Ex post facto only addresses creating a **new law** which makes
something you did **before the law** criminal. For example, I bought a
gun with a 15-round magazine. The next year, the brilliant and gifted
state legislators in my state decided that your magazine shouldn't have
more than 10 rounds, and buying or selling such a magazine is illegal.
It's appropriate, then, that all sales of magazines larger than 10
rounds *going forward* would be illegal, but it's not appropriate (and
is an example of ex post facto) to say that my purchase, before the law
was even created, was also illegal based on the new law.

In the case of Deputy Harding's QI, the 4th Amendment had not changed.
It was the same 4th Amendment before and after the SCOTUS ruling. The
only thing that changed was the interpretation of the Amendment. Without
Qualified Immunity, if it is really a violation of the 4th Amendment
now, it was a violation of the same, unchanged 4th Amendment then.
