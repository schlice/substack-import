**Why can\'t some religious people accept other people\'s beliefs?**

I can accept that people have a right to believe what they choose to
believe. I don't have to "accept their beliefs."

Because to accept their beliefs is to acknowledge that they are valid.
And every religion believes that theirs is the only religion and that
theirs is the only one which can lead to their adherents' salvation. It
is the nature of a religion: ours is the only way, the others are
misguided/wrong/blasphemous.
