**Do all police or cops carry assualt weapons or AK-47's?**

They don't routinely "carry" those weapons, but they usually have a
select-fire version of the AR-15 (selectable between semi-automatic and
full auto or burst mode) in their patrol car. It, of course, varies by
department, but officers do have these weapons available to them.

The rifle is locked in the patrol car, either in a mount in the trunk,
or in a locking retention clip in the passenger compartment.

They formerly carried a shotgun in these same mounts.
