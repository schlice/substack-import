**What are some of the biggest oversights in the Americans with
Disabilities Act?**

The ADA hamstrings businesses in favor of ease of access for the
disabled.

The law says that someone merely needs to claim to be disabled and
businesses must offer accommodations, no questions asked. So places of
public accommodation, like restaurants and amusement parks, are forced
to provide those accommodations to anyone who requests them. This has
led to widespread abuse of the system by the non-disabled. Businesses
are forced to limit the mechanisms by which accommodations are provided,
and what is actually provided, to the bare minimum required to make the
facility accessible, which does nothing to help the truly disabled.

Some balance in the law would have been nice. Some method of proving a
hidden disability would not have been terribly onerous on the disabled
person, but would greatly reduce abuse of the system.

*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.
Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a
civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not
misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously. My mental well-being
isn\'t worth your harassing, inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I
wrote, tough shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is
un-cited opinion masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m
wrong, write your own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site,
not a debate site. If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually,
you\'re wrong,\" don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment.
Put anything vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be
followed by a block and a mute. I will do this immediately and with no
compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*
