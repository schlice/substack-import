**What are ways to explain multiple sclerosis to children?**

I have found the electrical cord example to be the best one.

Kids can understand that there is a wire inside the insulation for a
table lamp, as an example. If you were to scrape the insulation off of a
section of electrical cord, the electricity wouldn't flow as well from
the wall to the bulb. The bulb might be dim, or it might flicker. You
could tape the wire, but it may never be the same.

The insulation is an analog for myelin, and the wire is a nerve fiber.
The bulb is a muscle, and the wall socket is the brain that sends the
electrical signals to the muscle. The electrical tape is the scar
