**Content:** [Several reasons that it was an acceptable weapon:\

1.  It\'s the weapon we had. It may not have been the weapon we wanted,
    but it was the weapon we had.
2.  It was a strategic weapon, not a tactical one. When you use
    strategic weapons like bombs, you know that there is collateral
    damage.
3.  Scientists knew that the results of the weapon would be devastating,
    but they didn\'t know exactly how devastating until they dropped
    it.\
4.  The decision to use it was fueled by many different things, but I
    can probably bet that Pearl Harbor was still fresh in Americans\'
    collective minds. I\'d also bet that if we were fighting a country
    and not a terrorist organization when 9/11 hit, there would have
    been calls to launch nuclear strikes against that country. I\'m
    reminded of the words of the orator John Stuart Mill:\

> War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things. The decayed and

It was a hard thing to do, but ultimately I think it ended the war with
fewer Japanese lives lost than the alternative would have (an Allied
invasion of Japan).
