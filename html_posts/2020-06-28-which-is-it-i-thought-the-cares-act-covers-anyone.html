**Which is it? I thought the CARES Act covers anyone who wants an
antibodies test to see if they had covid-19 at some point, but my
doctor\'s office said insurance won\'t pay unless people meet certain
criteria!**

The problem is your misunderstanding of the CARES Act and what it
actually provides. The Act **does not** provide free testing to anyone
who wants it. It **does** provide [[reimbursement to health care
providers and testing
facilities](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=aa330f&url=https://www.hrsa.gov/CovidUninsuredClaim){.external_link

qt-tooltip="hrsa.gov"}]{.qlink_container} for testing and treatment of
those who have no health insurance.

In addition, through Executive Order, the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (CMS), along with the Departments of Labor and
Treasury, modified coverage rules for private insurance. Specifically,
group health plans and group and individual health insurance must cover
both diagnostic testing and certain related items and services provided
during a medical visit with no cost sharing. This includes urgent care
visits, emergency room visits, and in-person or telehealth visits to the
doctor's office that result in an order for or administration of a
COVID-19 test. There are some costs that are exceptions to this rule,
and your employer can cover those if they choose.

Ultimately, this means that if you go to your doctor because you think
you have COVID-19, **and if** your doctor agrees that you should be
tested **and** they order a test for you, you can get a blood test, and
they can't charge you a copay for it.

As of today, there is no universal free testing for COVID-19 or its
antibodies. Even the drive-up testing sites require you to have a lab
slip from your doctor. So even though the test may be free once your
doctor orders it, your doctor still has to order it. And in order for
them to order a test for you, you have to be someone who might actually
have COVID-19. You can't just go to your doctor's office and say you
want an antibody test.

***HOWEVER***, all hope is not lost! We found a workaround for most
people who just want an antibody test.

**Give blood.**

Turns out, if you give blood with the Red Cross, they will test your
blood for the COVID-19 antibody. You'll get results back on the
[[OneBlood](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1a459c&url=http://oneblood.org){.external_link

qt-tooltip="oneblood.org"}]{.qlink_container} portal within like 3 days
or something. Check OneBlood to see where and if you can donate blood.
You'll be helping your community and helping yourself at the same time.

Even better, if you already had COVID-19 and you recovered, you can
donate plasma and potentially help someone else who gets it to get
better.
