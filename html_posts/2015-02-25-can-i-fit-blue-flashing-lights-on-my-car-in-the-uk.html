**Content:** [Diplomatic immunity only means that you can\'t be
prosecuted for a crime. It doesn\'t mean that officers can\'t stop you.
It doesn\'t mean you\'re not subject to the laws of the country in which
you are serving. It simply means that your crimes will be reported to
your home country who will (in all likelihood) recall you from your post
and you will face consequences once you return home.\
\
Fitting blue flashing lights to your car is only valid if your vehicle
is an emergency service vehicle (and this is true in the United States
as well). If you are not operating a emergency services vehicle
registered with a government agency which provides emergency services,
you cannot fit blue flashing lights to your vehicle.\
\
The only exception to this rule that I know of (in the US anyway): If
you drive a \"show car\" and you want to participate in shows where
customized (and non-road-legal) lights are permitted, you must disable
the lights before driving the vehicle on public roads. This normally
means removing a fuse to the lights so that they cannot \"accidentally\"
be activated while on a public road. There are plenty of instances in
the US where certain light kits are illegal while on the road, but are
encouraged at car shows. These owners must disable these lights before
driving on public roads.\
\
We used to have this problem in the 80s when \"Knight Rider\", starring
David Hasslehoff, was on the air. People would fit red \"chaser\" lights
to their Trans Ams much like the car in the show. Flashing red lights on
your car is just as illegal as flashing blue lights.\
