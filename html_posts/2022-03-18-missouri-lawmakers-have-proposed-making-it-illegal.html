In reality, it would be very difficult to enforce such a law.

But the point of it isn't to enforce it. The point is to *pass it to
send a message.*

Some people will get that message and will consider other options
besides abortion, like adoption. Others will think twice before having
unprotected sex.

Ultimately, the goal of the law is to reduce the number of unborn babies
that are killed. And if they achieve that goal, *even just a little*,
the law would be successful.
