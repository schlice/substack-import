I\'m not sure what you mean by \"lack of gun control measures.\"

Ask people in New York, Chicago, or Los Angeles whether or not there is
a \"lack of gun control measures\" and they will probably look at you as
if you have three heads.

My guess is what you really mean when you say \"lack of gun control
measures\" is \"why haven\'t you outlawed guns yet.\"

Besides the fact that it would be exceedingly difficult (although not
impossible) to do so, if we boycotted every country who had policies
with which we disagreed, there would be a scant few countries with which
we would actually trade.

Economics is not morality-based. You don\'t stop doing business with
someone because you don\'t like the way they live. You can impose
economic sanctions against a nation who is violating international
treaty or has been shown to be inhumane to its own people, but to be
frank, we are the world\'s superpower. It does little for a nation to
stop trading with us because they don\'t like our policies. It doesn\'t
hurt us, it only hurts the smaller nation who ceases trading with us.
