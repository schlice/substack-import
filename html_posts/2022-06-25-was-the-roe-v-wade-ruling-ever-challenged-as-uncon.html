No, there isn't anything covered by law that is exclusively a state's
right issue, because the Federal government can still pass laws which
apply to all 50 states. They didn't pass an abortion law because there
is no political will to do so, and the only laws proposed only appeal
directly to one side of the political debate, and so they did not move
forward. Since no one in Congress is willing to compromise, the law did
not pass.

The ruling in *Dobbs* corrected a mistake by the Court. *Roe* was
decided on the basis of a made-up right to privacy, which does not exist
in the Constitution. This is why that case was overturned.

Essentially, the Court determined that an issue like this should be
handled by the individual states, because they know that Congress
doesn't have the requisite authority to enact such a law. This doesn't
stop Congress from trying. It wouldn't stop them from passing a law
binding on all of the states, but they would have to do so under some
Constitutional authority. I'm curious which Constitutional authority
they would attempt to cite in order to pass abortion laws for all 50
states. The Commerce Clause?

Nevertheless, because Congress can not/did not act, the issue is left to
the states to decide for themselves.
