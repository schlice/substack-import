**Should you call 911 if you see somebody canvassing your neighborhood
with hate-speech filled pamphlets?**

If there is a crime in progress, or a crime is imminent, you should call
the police.

But distributing leaflets is not a crime, unless the person is clearly
trespassing. Distributing leaflets, or "flyposting," is not generally
considered to be a crime. The contents of the leaflets does not
generally modify the legality of the activity. The only exception is
religion, which is even more protected than general information
leaflets.

I suggest you check with your local city to see if you have an ordinance
against flyposting, or if you live in an HOA-controlled neighborhood,
see if your HOA allows flyposting. If it does, you might discuss
changing that with your HOA.
