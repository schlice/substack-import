**Content:** [You are talking about attempted crime. Whether or not the
*actus reus* (the guilty act) of attempt has taken place is a question
of fact for a jury to decide.\
\
The law varies by state, but the [[Model Penal
Code](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b93273&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_Penal_Code){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} states that for a
defendant to be convicted of an attempted crime, they have to perform a
\"substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in \[the
defendant\'\]s commission of the crime\" (MPC 5.01(1)(c)).\
\
So what does this mean? If the police arrest someone for an attempted
crime, the state has to show that the defendant performed a
\"substantial step\" towards committing that crime. In your example
above, the defendant plans a crime (let\'s assume it\'s a burglary),
gets some utensils (I assume you mean \"tools of the crime\"), and makes
plans when to execute the crime. All of these are legal and probably
wouldn\'t suffice as attempted criminal activity.\
\
However, if the police know when the defendant plans to execute the
crime, and they stake out the location and they see the defendant arrive
at that location, the arrival at the location of the planned crime at
the time of the plan would likely be considered a \"substantial step\"
towards the commission of the crime. With their foreknowledge of the
plan, the arrival of the defendant at the location of the crime at the
time at which the defendant pre-planned the crime would be considered
reasonable suspicion enough to perform a *Terry* search of the defendant
and his vehicle. If they find the aforementioned \"tools of the crime,\"
the police would then have the probable cause needed to arrest the
defendant for the crime of attempted burglary.\
\
In summary, in order to be considered an attempt, the defendant must
make a \"substantial step\" towards committing the crime (such as
travelling to the location at the pre-planned time). Simply planning a
crime is generally not considered a \"substantial step\" towards
commission of a crime.]{.rendered_qtext}
