**Who pays the HOA estoppel fee?**

Estoppels, which are more commonly known as HOA dues letters or HOA
certificates (depending on state), are documents used to prove that a
home seller does not have any outstanding debt or delinquent dues
payments before they sell their home.

**Because it is the seller who is coordinating with the HOA to prove
that they are "free and clear," it is the seller who pays this fee as
part of their closing costs.**

Interestingly, it is these fees (along with new account establishment
fees) which is where HOA management firms make their money. These fees
can be exorbitant, and the HOA does not make a big deal of disclosing
them (even though they are required to disclose the fees during contract
negotiations). HOA Board members, usually members of the community, are
generally not savvy enough to realize just how pricey these fees are and
how they relate to what other management companies charge, and they
usually ignore them.

Florida passed a bill in 2017 to try to cap unusually high estoppel
fees. SB 398 caps the fee for an association dues letter or
certification request at \$250.
