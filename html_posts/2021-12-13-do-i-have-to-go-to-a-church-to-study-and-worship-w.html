Short answer is no, you don't have to go to a church in order to be
saved.

But going to church helps you in your faith, in a number of ways:

- You learn more about the Bible, and grow your understanding about
  current events and what the Bible says about them. Pastors tend to
  pick a book of the Bible and then work through that book every week
  (We just finished Ecclesiastes, a very challenging book to work
  through). In doing so, you learn more about the book, and you learn
  more about how it applies to you in your everyday life.
- You gain *community* with other believers, which is vital to encourage
  you in your faith walk. The Bible does make it clear that it is
  important for Christians to spend time with and love one another.
  Going to church gives you that community.
- That community helps you learn how to pray, and can pray for you, and
  with you. Prayer is, of course, vital to your faith walk, so learning
  more about it can't be a bad thing. Having others pray with you, and
  pray for you, are immense comforts. Having someone who is there for
  you when you run into the big struggles of your life, and someone who
  is there for you when you have to deal with the little niggles that
  sometimes invade our daily thoughts is priceless, and it's really
  tough to do that on your own.
- Going to church holds you accountable. I know, you are perfect and
  never miss opening your Bible at least daily, right? I know I'm
  certainly not perfect. There are many days that I get way too busy, or
  my disease makes me too tired, and I end up not getting in to the Word
  like I should. God forgives us for that, but going to church helps to
  hold us accountable to embracing our faith and ensuring that those
  important messages permeate our hearts.
- Going to church provides you with opportunities to serve, not only
  other Christians, but your community. We know that works will flow
  from our faith, and while it's not necessary to have a church to
  enable our service, it does make it really, really simple.
  Opportunities for service abound at your local church, just show up
  with a willing heart and the church will absolutely find you a place
  to serve.
- And you can't ever say enough about what it *feels like* to be
  welcomed into a body of believers. If no one has ever welcomed you in,
  as if you were old friends, even though you have never met before, you
  should try going to church. If you don't go through your week
  thinking, "man, it's so invigorating and enjoyable to go to my church
  and to worship with other Christians who are so passionate in their
  faith! I can't wait to do it again!" then you are absolutely missing
  out.
