I've already answered this question over in the Multiple Sclerosis Forum
(and pinned it to the top):

[[MS and
COVID-19](https://multiplesclerosisforum.quora.com/MS-and-COVID-19)]{.qlink_container}

In short, having MS, by itself, does not make the vaccine safer or less
safe. It's all dependent on the specific disease modifying therapy (DMT)
you may be taking for MS.

This is an appropriate discussion to have with your neurologist.
