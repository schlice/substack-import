<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I think that it sends a message to lawmakers: Be specific<br>when writing your laws. If your law is overly broad, criminalizing First<br>Amendment activity instead of focusing solely on the issue of<br>cyberbullying, it will be struck down.\<br>\<br>The purpose of the law was pure. The motivation was right, and it could<br>be easily argued that the First Amendment allows for laws to prohibit<br>speech that has no legitimate value and is intended solely to harm<br>another person, especially children.\<br>\<br>This law, however, was not written that way. It was too broad, and<br>prohibited forms of speech protected by the First Amendment. This law<br>alone deserved to be struck down.\<br>\<br>Lawmakers need to do better.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
