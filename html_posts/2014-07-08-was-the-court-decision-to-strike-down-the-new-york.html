**Content:** [I think that it sends a message to lawmakers: Be specific
when writing your laws. If your law is overly broad, criminalizing First
Amendment activity instead of focusing solely on the issue of
cyberbullying, it will be struck down.\
\
The purpose of the law was pure. The motivation was right, and it could
be easily argued that the First Amendment allows for laws to prohibit
speech that has no legitimate value and is intended solely to harm
another person, especially children.\
\
This law, however, was not written that way. It was too broad, and
prohibited forms of speech protected by the First Amendment. This law
alone deserved to be struck down.\
\
Lawmakers need to do better.]{.rendered_qtext}
