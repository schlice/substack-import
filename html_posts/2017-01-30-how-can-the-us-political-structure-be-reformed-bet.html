TL;DR: Good thing we don't have a pure democracy and we don't elect
presidents based on popular vote. We don't need reform: we have the
Electoral College, and we have two houses of Congress, which balance
state-based representation with population-based representation.

*The Electoral College*. The Electoral College was put in place for this
very reason. Smaller states were upset because they would have less
representation when it came to the election. They were concerned about
the **tyranny of the majority**, where demagogues enthrall large
populations of people, and groupthink pervades. The demagogue rides a
wave of popularity directly to power, and the people not only support
his dangerous agenda, they actively encourage it. PRO TIP: if there is
dissension between government and groups of people, you're doing it
right. The Electoral College uses the same distribution of Electors as
we give that state for the House of Representatives (we'll get there in
a second) and the Senate. The formula uses the population of the state
along with the size of the landmass of the state to determine how many
Representatives (or Electors) are granted to each state. This gives
smaller states a more equitable say in Presidential elections than
larger, or simply more populous, states. Now, instead of populations
electing a President, we have *states* which elect a president. Each
state holds its own election, and the winner of the election in each
state gets the votes of that state's Electors. There are 538 Electors,
which equals the 435 members of the House of Representatives, 100
members of the Senate, and three representatives from the District of
Columbia, as provided for by the 12th Amendment.

*Congress*. The same debates which took place later regarding elections
took place earlier regarding Congress. Smaller states wanted more
representation, and feared the tyranny of the majority. Centralized
authority advocates feared having their state's will overridden by
smaller states or more distant states that had no relation to them. The
framers came up with, I think, a rather brilliant plan. It took pieces
from England's parliamentary system and improved on it. They created two
Houses of Congress, each with a unique configuration. The layout, by the
way, is all detailed in Article I of the Constitution. It is a true
combination of population-based representation, and state-based
representation, as is much of the Constitution.

- The House of Representatives is made up of a certain number of
  Representatives from each state. That number is determined by the
  population of that state (which is determined every ten years as part
  of the US Census). The state population provides for congressional
  districts, which each get one member of the House of Representatives.
  This is population-based representation.
- To balance this population/landmass representation, we also have a
  Senate, which is composed of two Senators from every state. In this
  body, all states are equal, and no state has any more or less
  influence than any other state. This is state-based representation.

Congress functions (when it actually does) because it has a mix of both
state-based and population-based representation.
