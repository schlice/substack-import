title: "Governments make things illegal, at one point, then change their mind. How many of us think there should be some retroactivity, and re-imbursement, for making someone out to be a criminal, when later they say its not a crime?"

The Constitution has, as one of its core principles, a prohibition
against *ex post facto* laws. This means that a law cannot be passed
which makes a *past action* illegal. So let's say, for example, that I
buy a gun. Then, next month, the government passes a law which says that
all people with brown hair cannot buy guns (just gloss over the
Constitutionality of that law for the moment). My purchase of a gun
before the law went into effect would not be illegal, because it
happened before the law was implemented.

The same is exactly true in the other direction. If something is
illegal, and then the law is changed making that thing legal, but you
did that thing while it was illegal, you're still guilty of doing the
thing while it was illegal.

That said, while what was done was illegal when it was done, the change
making it legal opens the door for people to challenge their convictions
in court, claiming that the change in law makes their conviction
invalid.

Additionally, some states (and in some cases, the Federal government)
have victim's restitutions funds which people convicted of crimes which
are no longer crimes then have access to. They may be able to receive
compensation for time served and for other negative consequences of
being convicted for a crime which is no longer a crime.
