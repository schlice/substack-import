**Your assertion is very easy to square. Because your assertion is
mostly wrong.**

While it may be illegal in most jurisdictions to lie *about your
identity*, and while it may be a Federal offense to lie to a Federal
official, *it is most definitely not illegal to lie to the police.* As
with everything, there are exceptions (such as if you've signed an
immunity agreement and are ready to give your statement, or if you lie
to specifically mislead the police in order to aid a criminal), but in
the vast majority of cases, it is not illegal to lie to the police.

That said, whether or not lying to the police *is in your best interest*
is another matter entirely.

In most cases, lying to the police simply gets you into more trouble
than you were in initially. But who knows. It may be beneficial to you
in the short term. Maybe you don't want to reveal who you were with in
that motel room in the middle of the afternoon, or her marital status.
You may lie out of embarrassment or shame, or to protect someone, or to
safeguard a marriage or spare someone's feelings.

The point is that in most cases, it is not illegal to lie to the police.
In fact, criminals do it all the time, and they're never charged with
"lying to the police" since that's not a thing.
