The only time you must be truthful with the police is when you are
providing your name and/or otherwise identifying yourself. Almost all
states require you to be truthful in that situation.

Other than that, you are under no legal obligation to be truthful with
the police. Whether or not it is a *good idea* to lie is a whole other
story.
