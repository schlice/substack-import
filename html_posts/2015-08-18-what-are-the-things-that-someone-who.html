**Content:** [It may seem scary, but statistically speaking, flying in a
plane is the safest form of travel. Cars kill millions more than
airplanes do. The newness of the sensations is usually the scary part.
Here\'s some tips for the first time flyer:\
]{.rendered_qtext}

1.  Listen to the flight attendants and do what they tell you. Besides,
    it\'s required under Federal law.
2.  The flight may be bumpy. The bumps may sometimes feel like a rough
    road, or rarely will feel like big stinking potholes that would
    break a car or a bus. Don\'t worry. The plane can handle far more
    than you can.
3.  If you\'re at all prone to motion sickness, grab some Dramamine
    before you go. You\'ll be glad you did. Very few people ever need to
    use the air sickness bags located in the seat pocket in front of
    you, but if it\'s your first time and you are not used to the
    sensations of flight, it might be a little disorienting. PRO TIP: If
    you feel nautious during turning maneuvers, look out the window at
    the wing. Seeing something stable while the plane turns will assist
    your brain. Looking down the aisle toward the nose of the airplane
    will be disorienting as the plane will be turning about its
    horizontal axis while you look at an area which, for all intents and
    purposes, is supposed to be still.\
4.  Under most circumstances, the flight will take off and will
    eventually level off at cruising altitude. It will be mostly smooth.
    Sometimes, flights experience unexpected turbulence, and sometimes
    flights experience continuous chop throughout. While annoying, it\'s
    not dangerous. Pilots will try to avoid the chop in the air by
    increasing or decreasing altitude to get around it. Normally, there
    is some turbulence on takeoff and climb as well as on descent and
    landing. If the landing location is extremely windy or is
    experiencing highly shifting winds, the pilot may have to \"come in
    hot\" and land fast and (sometimes) hard. Note that this does not
    often happen, but if winds are about to become out of limits for
    landing, but they\'re not yet, it may. On one very turbulent
    descent, I remember telling my son, \"it\'s okay \[that we\'re
    rolling around during descent\], but the pilot is going to have to
    come in hot\" and at that exact moment, we touched down. I say
    \"touched down\" because that\'s the term, but there was no touching
    about that landing. It was a bang. Hard landing. Sometimes it
    happens. Like I said, the plane can take far more abuse than you
    can.\
5.  The air pressure will change in the cabin during the flight. The
    cabin is pressurized so you won\'t pass out, but there are
    differences in cabin pressure. Your ears will pop on the way up and
    will pop on the way down. If you don\'t equalize pressure on your
    ears easily, try chewing gum, yawning or swallowing, or look into
    the [[Valsalva
    maneuver](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=523f14&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valsalva_maneuver){.external_link
    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
    qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}.
6.  TSA. Security screenings. Annoying! Check your airline\'s website
    and the [[Transportation Security
    Administration](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=acf0b6&url=http://www.TSA.gov){.external_link
    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
    qt-tooltip="tsa.gov"}]{.qlink_container} website for information on
    what you can bring through a security checkpoint and what you
    cannot, along with how security screenings work. It should go
    without saying that weapons of any kind cannot be brought on to an
    airplane. Also, no liquids, aerosols or gels in any quantity of over
    three ounces can come with you through the checkpoint. You can buy
    them once on the concourse, but they can\'t come through security.
    Details for how to pack your liquids to go through security on the
    TSA website. If you\'re going to pack liquids in your checked
    luggage, don\'t forget that pressure will change and liquids can
    leak from their containers. I\'d suggest packing them inside some
    plastic wrap. Don\'t lock your bags unless you have TSA-approved
    security locks. The TSA-approved locks have one of these symbols on
    them:\

    :::: ui_qtext_image_outer
    ::: qtext_image_wrapper
    ![](images/qimg-34b1e63ab9a13b56f2adf2264a460bb4){.landscape
    .qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed
    master_src="images/qimg-34b1e63ab9a13b56f2adf2264a460bb4"
    master_w="200" master_h="103"}
    :::
    ::::

    \
    Make sure that if you\'re going to lock your checked bags, the lock
    has one of those symbols on them. TSA has special \"keys\" that open
    those locks so they can search your bags. Locks without that symbol
    will be cut.\
7.  If you can stand it, sit in a window seat. On most wide-body jets
    with six seats across (three and three), it will be seat A or
    seat F. You have to see the view. Enjoy it, it\'s a total blast, and
    it is simply beautiful.
8.  While you\'re picking your seat online (when you buy your tickets),
    use a website like
    [[SeatGuru.com](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=004fee&url=http://www.seatguru.com){.external_link
    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
    qt-tooltip="seatguru.com"}]{.qlink_container} to help you find the
    best seats.
9.  If you happen to chat up a flight attendant while you\'re stowing
    your gear and getting in your seat, tell him/her that this is your
    first real flight ever. I bet you\'ll be pleasantly surprised.
    Please report back after your flight and let us know how it went.\

Most importantly, be patient with everyone (remember, there are roughly
300 people on that plane, and two thirds of them are in a hurry to get
somewhere, so relax, go with the flow) and most importantly, don\'t fret
your flight, enjoy it! It will be all new experiences, so have fun with
it!
