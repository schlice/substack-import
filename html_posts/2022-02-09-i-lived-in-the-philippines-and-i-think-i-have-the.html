Yes, it is possible for a Filipina to get MS. I am unaware of any higher
or lower risk to Filipinas specifically in terms of contracting MS, but
it's certainly not impossible for a Filipina to contract MS.

The next step for you is to find a neurologist in your area who can help
you diagnose what you're experiencing. MS is a difficult disease to
diagnose, because every symptom of MS is also a symptom of another
disease or condition. Your neurologist has to rule out all of the other
diseases or conditions which can cause your symptoms before diagnosing
you with MS.

Short answer: find a neurologist who can help you determine from where
your symptoms originate.
