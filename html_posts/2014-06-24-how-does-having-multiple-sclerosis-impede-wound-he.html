<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [While it is unlikely that MS itself would impede wound<br>healing, it\'s possible that there could be an interaction with one of<br>the medications that a person takes for MS or for a side effect of MS or<br>the medication.\<br>\<br>There are four distinct phases to wound healing (hemostasis,<br>inflammation, proliferation and remodeling) and all have to happen in<br>the proper sequence, in the proper order and for the appropriate<br>duration for a wound to heal. The NIH has an excellent write-up of the<br>course of wound healing and what happens during and between those four<br>phases<br>[here.(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d04a0b&url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2903966/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nih.gov"}]{.qlink_container}\<br>\<br>If you examine the factors affecting wound healing, medication is a big<br>one. Anti-inflammatory medications will affect the wound healing<br>process, as the second phase of wound healing is inflammation. Limit<br>inflammation and you limit the speed of wound healing. MS is an<br>inflammatory disease, and many MS medicines are anti-inflammatory,<br>slowing or interfering with the immune system\'s responses. This can<br>have a significant effect on the amount of time a wound can take to<br>heal. Stress is also a major player in affecting speed of wound<br>healing.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
