**Content:** [While it is unlikely that MS itself would impede wound
healing, it\'s possible that there could be an interaction with one of
the medications that a person takes for MS or for a side effect of MS or
the medication.\
\
There are four distinct phases to wound healing (hemostasis,
inflammation, proliferation and remodeling) and all have to happen in
the proper sequence, in the proper order and for the appropriate
duration for a wound to heal. The NIH has an excellent write-up of the
course of wound healing and what happens during and between those four
phases

\
If you examine the factors affecting wound healing, medication is a big
one. Anti-inflammatory medications will affect the wound healing
process, as the second phase of wound healing is inflammation. Limit
inflammation and you limit the speed of wound healing. MS is an
inflammatory disease, and many MS medicines are anti-inflammatory,
slowing or interfering with the immune system\'s responses. This can
have a significant effect on the amount of time a wound can take to
heal. Stress is also a major player in affecting speed of wound
healing.]{.rendered_qtext}
