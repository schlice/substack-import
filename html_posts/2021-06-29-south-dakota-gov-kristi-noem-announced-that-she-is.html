Her *motivation* may be political, considering she is a politician.
Everything she does is seen through a political lens.

But she isn't just sending law enforcement officers to the southern
border for her own benefit. She's doing so *because they asked for
help.*

Texas and Arizona sent requests for help under a mutual law enforcement
support agreement between the states, and South Dakota is sending
National Guard troops to help. Florida said about a week ago that it was
sending 50 law enforcement officers to Texas and Arizona to help as
well.

Original question:

South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem announced that she is sending law
enforcement officers to the U.S. border with Mexico. Is this simply a
political move to support and highlight Trump\'s plan to visit the
border this week?
