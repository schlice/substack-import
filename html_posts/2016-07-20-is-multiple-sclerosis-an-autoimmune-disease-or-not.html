Multiple Sclerosis is "autoimmune" not because of the blood-brain
barrier, but because it is the immune system that is mistakenly
attacking normal, healthy body tissue. The definition of an autoimmune
disease is one in which the body's own immune system turns on it and
attacks normal body tissue.

In the case of MS, T lymphocytes will attack the myelin sheath
surrounding nerve fibers in the CNS (yes, after penetrating the
blood-brain barrier) and leaves plaques, or "scars" in its place where
nerve signals are degraded. This is why the disease is called "multiple
sclerosis," or "many scars."
