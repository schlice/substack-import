**If law in the US is weakened by the practices of imprisoning migrants
without due process and stripping them of their children, what is to
stop the government from doing it to legal American citizens?**

What do you mean, what's to stop the government from doing it to
American citizens? **We already do.** Every day. We strip children from
people without due process.

It's called **what happens when you get arrested.**

Whether you're illegally entering the country at the border, or whether
you just got arrested on a drug charge, we strip your children away.
That's the law.

It doesn't weaken US law. It shows that we are *enforcing* US law. If
Congress is so keen on not taking children from their parents, Congress
should change that law (which was affirmed by the courts, by the way).

But what would you have law enforcement do instead? Build *Mommy and Me*
jails? Family prison? Certainly don't want to strip people of their
children, so they all go to jail! Sounds fair to me.
