**Can private schools in the US teach whatever they want?**

The short answer is yes.

The longer answer is that all schools in a state are *accredited* by
that state. Accreditation involves auditing the school's curriculum and
ensuring that the appropriate courses are indeed taught in accordance
with state law. Students must also be taught in such a way that they
score on par with public schools on standardized testing.

Beyond that, private schools can, indeed, teach whatever they want.
