And what part of his job did he fail to do? What law did he violate?

It appears the problem here is that you are gleefully unaware of what
his actual job is.

I challenge you to find a police officer job description which reads,
\"Gets killed when necessary.". Police officers are under no obligation
to get themselves killed while attempting to enforce the law.

Additionally, we don\'t know the particular rules in this department for
active shooter situations. This officer was alone and outgunned. Going
into that school alone would have been suicide. And his department may
have expressly forbid a solo officer from entering an active shooter
situation without backup. He contained the situation, which met his
legal obligation for "doing his job."

Also, police officers are under no obligation to keep you safe. They
have a general duty to keep the public-at-large safe, but they have no
specific duty to keep any one individual or any group of people safe. If
you willingly enter a gun-free zone, it is the venue\'s responsibility
to keep you safe, not the police.

Finally, let me add this. Every police officer out there feels terrible
for this particular Deputy. We all know that cognitive dissonance when
you know that you can\'t make a difference, but you desperately want to.
This Deputy resigned days after this incident, which leads me to believe
that the cognitive dissonance was so debilitating, that he could no
longer do his job. The pressure and criticism from the uninformed, like
you, must have also been tremendous, and he will have to deal with that
for the rest of his life. We feel awful for the victims and their
families, but you must recognize that the deputy is a victim as well.
