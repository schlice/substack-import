**Content:** [So, alien-looking meaning \"looking like they are from
Mars\"? ;-)\
\
I would ask you to consider this scenario:\
\
I\'m a police officer patrolling a predominantly black neighborhood. I
see a rather nice-looking sedan with four white boys (late teens-early
20s) driving around the neighborhood.\
\
Does that tell me anything? Should it? Well, if it does (and by the way,
it does), I have just profiled the presumed activities of those boys
based on their race.\
\
Can I do that? Yep, I sure can. It\'s human nature to do that.\
\
Can I stop the vehicle because there is a car full of four white boys in
a predominantly black neighborhood? Nope. That\'s racial profiling, and
I can\'t use that as justification to stop the car.\
\
But if I\'m following the car and they run a stop sign, I can stop the
car because they ran a stop sign and I can then ask them what they\'re
doing in this neighborhood.\
\
I also suspect that the woman who was being \"pulled away\" was being
pulled away for another reason. The fact that she didn\'t show them any
ID is suspicious in and of itself, but if she was being asked questions
which she couldn\'t answer, whether or not she looks \"alien\" is not
relevant.]{.rendered_qtext}
