**Why don't cops give out tickets for tailgating? If holding a phone is
against the law, then why not enforce tailgating rules? Isn't that just
as dangerous?**

They do, just not when you expect.

The violation is not called "tailgating," it's called "following too
closely." Our local police issue that ticket many times a day. But
usually it's in conjunction with a **rear-end collision.**

When you are involved in a rear-end collision in Colorado, *the driver
at the rear is always at fault.* The only time that would be at issue is
if there was some kind of brake check going on, and the rear driver
would have to prove that (hope he has cameras on his car). That rear
driver is ticketed for causing the accident. What's the law violated?
Yep, you guessed it: following too closely.

In most other cases, it's really difficult for a police officer to see
tailgating while its ongoing. It happens quickly, and resolves just as
quickly. When the tailgating causes an accident, however, the officers
universally cite the driver for that violation.
