There are several items that police officers use frequently. Not all
devices are used by all departments, but most police departments
generally use one form or another of these devices. In almost all cases,
officers must be trained and certified on each device they carry on
their duty belts in order to lawfully carry them.

**TASER**

about most frequently these days. It is in a class of devices known as a
"pain compliance device" even though beyond the initial pain, it really
functions by disrupting nerve signals between the spinal cord and the
muscles, essentially "overloading" the nerves with electrical impulses,
and rendering the person incapable of moving. TASER is an acronym
invented by the device's inventor and his favorite comic book character,
Tom Swift. TASER stands for "Thomas A. Swift's Electronic Rifle."

**PEPPER SPRAY**

concentrated oils from hot peppers. In chemical terms, it is called
***oleoresin capsicum*** or OC for short. It causes inflammation of
mucus membranes in the eyes, nose, and sinus cavities, producing pain
and mucus discharge, and rendering an attacker incapacitated for a short
time.

**BATON**

The baton is an impact weapon which can be used for striking an
attacker, as well as in combination with holds to incapacitate an
attacker. It is collapsible, which makes it more convenient to carry.
Most commonly, the baton comes in 16″ and 21″ variants, with a
rubberized or padded handle and steel construction. Batons can also be
equipped with a pointed end-cap which can be used to break glass.

Without the end cap, officers will usually break glass by striking it
with the business end of the extended baton.
