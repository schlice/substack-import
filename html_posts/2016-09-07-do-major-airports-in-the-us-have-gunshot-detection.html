The answer to any question that is worded in the **why doesn't X have Y
technology which is currently available** is the same: money.

When you are deciding whether or not to make a purchase (such as buying
gunshot detection systems for an airport), you do what's known as a
*cost-benefit analysis.* You have to compare the cost to the benefit you
will receive from the purchase. If the benefit exceeds the cost, you
make the purchase. If not, you do not. It's actually far more nuanced
than that, but that's the basic thrust of the argument.

In order for a gunshot detection system to be cost-effective, it must
address a frequent problem in a better/more efficient/faster way than it
is currently being addressed. So to start, you have to address a
frequent problem. This, most assuredly, is not. So right off the bat,
we're not addressing a frequent problem, so the cost will likely be
considered too high to offset the minimal benefit you will see from
implementing the system.
