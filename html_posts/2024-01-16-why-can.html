Because there isn't "an author" of the Bible. Hard to have a single
writer produce 66 chapters of a book over the course of 1500 years.

There are 40 writers of the Bible from all different backgrounds.
Everyone from kings to humble fishermen wrote books. They wrote prophecy
and poetry and prose and law and history. They lived, over the course of
that 1500 years, on three different continents, and spoke and wrote
three different languages. They wrote from throne rooms and prison
cells, the wilderness and places of exile.

Yet through all of that diversity, through all of those varied locations
and languages and lifestyles, there is **unity** in the message of the
Bible. It never contradicts itself, and throughout the entire book, it
tells the same story of redemption.

That's because the *true* author, the One who inspired all of those
writers, is the Holy Spirit. These writers were all divinely inspired to
write what they did.

Oh, and also, atheists don't care about identifying the author of a
Christian holy book. So there's that.
