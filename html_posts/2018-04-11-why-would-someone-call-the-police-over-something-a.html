**Why would someone call the police over something as trivial and
nonthreatening as her senior photo?**

The woman in question, "called the police" by posting a tweet. So first
of all, there's no emergency if you're using Twitter. Secondly, she
asked the police to "weigh in" because apparently the girl took the
photo at a location where the tweeter believes guns were disallowed by
the establishment. Her reasoning? When an establishment posts a sign
that says "no guns," carrying one is "irresponsible, reckless, and
potentially dangerous."

This sounds more like a case of virtue signaling to me than anything
else. First of all, Brenna Spencer was *outside* of the location which
did not allow guns *inside*. Secondly, how is it "okay" to carry a gun
outside, but once you go inside, it's "irresponsible, reckless, and
potentially dangerous?" The difference between the interior and the
exterior of a building makes the difference between "okay" and
"irresponsible, reckless, and potentially dangerous?" Hardly. All it
shows is that the tweeter, Victoria Silva (@Victoria\_\_Silva), is
[[ammophobic](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=204c60&url=https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term%3Dammophobic){.external_link

qt-tooltip="urbandictionary.com"}]{.qlink_container}. Carrying a gun
properly (as Brenna was, in a belly band) is no more dangerous than
carrying a lighter. Actually, it's safer than carrying a lighter. But a
lighter can't protect you from a bad guy. It's certainly not "reckless,"
as there is no evidence that Brenna is improperly carrying her gun, or
waving it about in a reckless manner. And the only person in the picture
taking any responsibility for her own safety is Brenna. So it appears
that Ms. Silva is 100% off base. Her comments only reveal her own
dislike of firearms and her desire to control *others'* behavior in
order to control *her own* issues.
