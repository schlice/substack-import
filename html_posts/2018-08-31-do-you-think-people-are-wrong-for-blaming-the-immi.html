**Do you think people are wrong for blaming the immigration laws for the
reason why Molly Tibbets was murdered?**

Well, the law didn't murder Molly Tibbets. An illegal immigrant did. He
is solely responsible for her murder.

But as we always do, we start to look for the *reasons.* Why did he do
it? Why was he even in this country? How did he get here? How did we
allow him in?

It's plainly obvious that a **contributory factor** (not the **proximate
cause**) to this murder was the fact that he was an illegal immigrant.

It's not hard to stretch that fact to the conclusion that tighter
immigration laws may have prevented the illegal immigrant from being in
the country in the first place.
