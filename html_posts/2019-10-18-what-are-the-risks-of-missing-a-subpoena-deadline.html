**What are the risks of missing a subpoena deadline?**

As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."

If you missed a "subpoena to appear" issued by a court, and you fail to
appear, the judge can issue a bench warrant for your arrest. The Sheriff
can then arrest you and deliver you to the judge.

If you have been subpoenaed to provide sworn testimony, the agency
issuing the subpoena can bring it before a judge and if it is found to
be valid and the requirement for the information is found to be
necessary, the judge can issue that same bench warrant for your arrest.

Note that the warrants for your arrest come from the judge, not the
agency issuing the subpoena.
