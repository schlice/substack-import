**Why not strip police officers of any immunity so that victims can
prosecute POs for any brutality so that they will face either jail time
or death penalty?**

Who in their right mind would do that job? And if you don't get people
in their right mind, you get *everyone else*, and I'm not sure that
accomplishes your goal, either.

It's hard enough to get officers to fill job vacancies with the months
of tests and evaluations that must be done before you are even offered a
job. In 2013, out of a pool of about 200 applicants, we were able to
field a class of 14 recruits. 14 out of 200. That's 7%. And if you don't
protect officers from frivolous lawsuits which could personally bankrupt
them just for doing the job you asked them to do, how many people are
going to show up for that first test? And they might, in your words, go
to jail or be killed for doing the job you asked them to do. Who's going
to do that? 100 if you're lucky, but I'd bet it's far fewer than that.
What's 7% of 50? 4. You can't field a new class with 4 recruits. And
with the new legislation going in to place to prevent police brutality,
there's only going to be more restrictions on who can enter law
enforcement academies, not less.
