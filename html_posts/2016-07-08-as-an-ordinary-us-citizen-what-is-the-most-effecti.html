Education. This is the most important thing you can do.

If you don't own a gun, go down to your local gun range and take an
"introduction to firearms" course. Almost every gun range I know offers
one. It's inexpensive and gives you a comprehensive introduction to what
firearms are, what they do, and what they feel like when you fire them.
In this way, you too can separate the facts from the hype when it comes
to what you're told.

If you do own a gun, store it safely. There are numerous gun safes
which, using technology, allow you almost instantaneous access to your
gun while keeping it out of the hands of bad guys or curious visitors to
your home.

Once you're educated, teach others about gun safety. Teach them that
law-abiding gun owners are not the enemy. Law-abiding gun owners are the
safest group in this country, as they tend to also follow other laws
just as carefully.
