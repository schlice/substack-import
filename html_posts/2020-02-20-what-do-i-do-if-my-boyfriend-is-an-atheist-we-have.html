**What do I do if my boyfriend is an atheist? We have been dating for 2
years and 7 in a half months, but I have recently tried to bring God
into the equation more and he doesn\'t seem to want to change with me. I
want breaking up to be the last option.**

You may want it to be the last option, but it might be the only one.
Because unfortunately, **you two are not going to be able to move
forward without a healthy faith base between you.**

The truth is that without faith, his morality is *self-referential*. He
may be a stand-up guy today, but that could change at any time, and he
has only himself to determine whether or not that change is good, or
useful. He may decide that your love life isn't what he wants, and
sleeping around is good for everyone. He may not believe this now, but
what about tomorrow? When he only has himself to determine his morality,
he can choose to change at any time, and it would be perfectly fine for
him. Not so for you, though.

Without faith, there is no future.

In order to move forward in your relationship, he has to be willing to
work on his faith. He has to be willing to at least try.

I'm not going to be one to tell you to stick by him and marry him and
have kids with him if he steadfastly refuses to work on his faith. I'm
sorry, but that's a non-starter for me. I would advise you to make it a
deal breaker for you. We could sit here all day and try to divine God's
plan for you two. But our human brains simply can't wrap themselves
around the depth of God's plans for us. Instead, we have to live how we
know we are supposed to live, based on the Bible. Here is what it says
about this:

> Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness
> and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with
> darkness? What harmony is there between Christ and Belial? Or what
> does a believer have in common with an unbeliever? What agreement is
> there between the temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of
> the living God.
>
> - 2 Cor 6:14--16 NIV

If he likes pizza and you don't, that's a disagreement you can live
with, and even work around. Or if he likes death metal and you like 80's
hair bands, you can work around that too. But this is a bridge too far.
The Bible warns against it, and this is the truth we can rest on.
