You'll be charged with a fine for violating that state's traffic laws.

Whether or not you get points assigned is complicated and depends on the
state you're from and the state you're in. Most states will report the
ticket back to your home state. 45 states plus the District of Columbia
have agreed to the Driver's License Compact (DLC) which requires them to
share information about moving violations back to the home state. Points
*may* be recorded depending on the state you're from and the state
you're in. Some states do assign out of state points, and some do not.

If you want to go to court instead of simply paying the fine, you'll
have to return to the state to do so.
