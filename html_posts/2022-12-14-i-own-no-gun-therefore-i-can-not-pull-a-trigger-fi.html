I'm pretty sure that anyone with average intelligence understands the
fact that if you have no gun, you can't shoot someone.

You forgot to add the sentence you're implying. **So therefore, you
should own no gun either, then no one can shoot anyone**.

A pleasant thought, but criminals don't give a damn what you think.
Therefore, the only person who will actually own a gun is a criminal.
And he'll kill you and walk away scot-free.

See the problem? You've voluntarily disarmed yourself (perfectly
allowed), *but then you've insisted that I do the same* (perfectly
disallowed). And none of your "understanding" has any bearing whatsoever
on criminals, who by definition don't follow the law. So even if you
made owning guns illegal, they still will own guns. And then they'll be
the only ones with guns.

I got an idea! Why don't you make killing people illegal? Then no one
can kill anyone, either.
