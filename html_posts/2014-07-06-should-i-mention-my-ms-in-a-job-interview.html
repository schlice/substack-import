**Content:** [Legally, you are under no obligation to reveal your
medical condition to your prospective employer until you require
accommodations. At that point, you will be telling them you have a
disability and what accommodations you need and as long as they are
reasonable, there should be no problem. Reasonable accommodations are
ones that can be provided without undue fiscal stress on the employer or
modifying the requirements of the job. For instance, if you require that
you have to only work 2 hours a day, that would be an unreasonable
accommodation because there is a good chance you would not be getting
the job done. You can miss work for doctor\'s appointments incident to
your disability, but if you miss work so much that your job is not being
accomplished, this accommodation could become unreasonable.\
\
The Americans with Disabilities Act is very clear about this point. Your
employer is only allowed to ask you whether or not you can
\"\...complete the essential functions of the job with or without
reasonable accommodations\" to wit you can answer yes or no. They cannot
dig any further. For instance, if the job requires that you stand for 8
hours a day and you can\'t do that, your medical condition may make you
ineligible for that job. If the job requires that you be able to lift
100 pounds and you can\'t do that, your medical condition may make you
ineligible for that job. The employer is required to state up-front the
physical requirements of the job, and you are required to tell them
whether or not you can do them, yes or no. Additionally, they are
allowed to do pre-employment testing of these requirements. Your medical
history and current medical treatments are also confidential and are not
allowed to be released to your employer without your consent.\
\
And by the by, there is nothing \"wrong\" with you. You have a
disability. Doesn\'t mean you can\'t do the job. Ultimately, that\'s all
that matters.]{.rendered_qtext}
