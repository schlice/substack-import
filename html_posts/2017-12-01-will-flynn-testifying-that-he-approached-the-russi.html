**Will Flynn testifying that he approached the Russian intelligence for
meddling in the US election on behalf of Trump, provide reasonable
grounds for impeachment?**

No, not even close.

Flynn spoke to the Russians before Trump took office, but after the
election was over. This was at KT McFarland's direction. This is
standard operating procedure for transition teams.

Much ado over nothing.
