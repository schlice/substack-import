In the vast majority of cases, HOAs do not handle disagreements between
neighbors. HOAs handle violations of their rules.

But let's assume for argument's sake that you meant that the neighbor
had a complaint about me violating an HOA rule. I'd prefer that my
neighbors remain "neighborly" and if they think I'm in violation of an
HOA rule, I'd appreciate it if they came to me and told me about it
first so I could fix it before the HOA became involved.

But even if they went directly to the HOA, I'd simply get a courtesy
letter saying I was in violation, and I'd fix it straight away. No harm,
no foul.

Anonymous letters are cowardly and childish. If someone sent me an
anonymous letter, I'd literally blow it off and leave it until the HOA
sent me their courtesy letter and then I'd fix it. I don't respond to
anonymous letters. If you want to tell me something, have the courage to
stand behind your beliefs.

Original question:

If a neighbor in your HOA had a complaint or concern about you, would
you rather they contacted you to discuss it directly, sent you an
anonymous letter or just reported their issue to the HOA and let them
handle it?
