[[Bill Stein\'s answer to Why does my husband use incognito mode in his
browser?](https://www.quora.com/Why-does-my-husband-use-incognito-mode-in-his-browser/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container}

This answer has 286k views and over 12k upvotes. I still don't
understand why it got so much attention. I also don't understand what
drove its popularity. I wasn't first to the party, but I guess to the
folks that look at that category, they liked it. I was just trying to
provide some useful information regarding Private Browsing / Incognito
Mode and why one might use it. Instead, I hit on my most upvoted answer.

property.](https://www.quora.com/Someone-prank-calls-911-They-send-police-to-my-address-it-is-1-am-and-I-am-sleeping-I-injure-kill-the-cop-thinking-he-is-a-criminal-What-happens-The-cop-cops-didnt-yell-Police-when-coming-into-my-property/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container}

This answer has 940k views. Again, I have no idea what caused this
answer to get so much attention. Even weirder, even though it is my most
viewed answer, it only has 721 upvotes. I have plenty of other answers
with more upvotes, but my most viewed answer has less than 1k upvotes.

[[Bill Stein\'s answer to If an unidentified passenger plane flew into
the American mainland and ignored all attempts at communicating with it,
how would the military
respond?](https://www.quora.com/If-an-unidentified-passenger-plane-flew-into-the-American-mainland-and-ignored-all-attempts-at-communicating-with-it-how-would-the-military-respond/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container}

This is one of my favorite answers, because it deals with NORAD, where I
used to work while I was on Active Duty. It's something I'm passionate
about, so it was easy to write about. And what do I get for my passion?
Only 66,8k views, and 449 upvotes. Sheesh.
