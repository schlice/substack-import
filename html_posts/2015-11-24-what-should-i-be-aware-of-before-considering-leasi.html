Legally, you should consider zoning laws in your area. You need to
ensure that the locality in which you live permits you to build aerials
on top of your house. There are regulations such as max height and
transmitting in your area, but this is all dependent on exactly where
you are located and how it is zoned.\
\
Since we\'re talking cell phones, the radiation levels are not unsafe
(if you were talking microwave long-haul telephone, that would be a
different story altogether). The amount of radiation you get from a cell
phone tower is about 10,000 times less energetic than the UV radiation
you get from standing in the sun, and not many people have developed
radiation poisoning from standing in the sun. You should enquire as to
how the house below the tower is shielded, or if the beam is beamformed
in such a way that there is no impact to the residence below.\
\
You should consider what needs to happen when the cell phone company
needs to do maintenance on the equipment. Be aware that most of that
maintenance will be off-hours (evenings and weekends). Will they notify
you, or will they have rights to waltz onto your property at any time
they choose and climb up to your roof?\
\
Then, as some of the other answers alluded to, you should ask the
\"what\'s in it for me\" questions. Besides the money you will receive
from the lease agreement, will your signal improve? If not, can they add
an attached picocell to the tower gear to do so? I mean, if you have a
cell on your roof, you should have full signal
everywhere.]{.rendered_qtext}
