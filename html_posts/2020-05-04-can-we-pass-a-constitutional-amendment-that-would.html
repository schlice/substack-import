**Can we pass a constitutional amendment that would allow states to
leave the United States of America?**

People love to throw around the term "Constitutional crisis" like it's
confetti. However, this is exactly the type of action that would, in
actuality, create a Constitutional crisis.

While it is possible to craft and ratify an Amendment to the
Constitution which would permit a State to secede from the Union,
depending on what the requirements for secession look like, the
Amendment could cause another Civil War should a state attempt to secede
under the authority of that Amendment.

In the United States, the Supreme Court ruled in *Texas v. White* that
unilateral secession is unconstitutional, but that an "indissoluble"
union *could be dissolved* by one of two methods: revolution, or
*consent of the states*.

Therefore, an Amendment is really not necessary. A state can secede from
the Union if it receives the consent of **all of the states**. If even
one state says no, then the seceding state may not leave.

The reason?

When a state became part of the Union, it was clearly stated that this
action would be perpetual and indissoluble. The state gained all of the
rights of the group, and shouldered all of the responsibilities of being
a member of the group. When it comes to decisions related to the group,
the whole of the group must now be in agreement.

For that reason, a state can declare its intent to secede from the
Union, but it can only actually do so with the full consent of all of
the member states, since they all belong to the same Union. They all
joined with the same admonition, and under the same rules. They didn't
become separate states part of a loose coalition, but instead became
part of an indissoluble union. They all expected that. Each member state
has to agree to "lose" the seceding state. They must be unanimous.

And there are logistical problems. What happens to Federal territories
within the state? Do they become foreign embassies? How does the nation
get compensated for the loss of National Parks? Or all the Federal
dollars we provided in assistance to the state? The tendrils of
interconnection between the state and all of the others would be
difficult to sort.

**TL;DR:** At best, an Amendment could say that a state can declare its
intention to leave, but then *all of this* would be up to every other
state to approve before it could be completed.
