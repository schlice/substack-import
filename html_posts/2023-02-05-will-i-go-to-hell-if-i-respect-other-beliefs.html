Depends on what you mean by "respect."

Do you "respect other beliefs" by allowing others with differing beliefs
to live and believe as they choose? Then you're good! We are to love our
neighbors as we love ourselves. It is right that everyone has the
freedom to believe as they choose and live their lives as they wish.

Do you "respect other beliefs" by claiming that their beliefs are just
as right and just as valid as ours? That may be problematic, because it
doesn't make logical sense.

For example, Christianity teaches that Jesus rose from the dead; Islam
teaches that Jesus never died. Which one is it? One of those must be
right, and the other one must be wrong. There is no middle ground there.
Conservative Christians believe that those who haven't accepted Christ
as their Savior have chosen hell as their ultimate destination. It's
often overlooked, but many Muslims believe the same about non-Muslims:
they're headed for hell as well. And Hindus generally believe that
everyone, regardless of beliefs, is caught in an indefinite cycle of
reincarnation based on works. These contradictory beliefs can't all be
true.

Here's a few more:

- Jews, Christians, and Muslims believe in different versions of a
  theistic God, while most Hindus and New Agers believe that everything
  that exists is part of an impersonal, pantheistic force they call God.
- Many Hindus believe that evil is a complete illusion, while
  Christians, Muslims, and Jews believe that evil is real.
- Christians believe that people are saved by grace while all other
  religions, if they believe in salvation at all, teach some kind of
  salvation by good works (the definition of "good" and what one is
  saved from varies greatly).

These are just a few of the many essential differences. So much for the
idea that all religions teach basically the same things!

In fact, when you look across all world religions, you find there are
far more differences, especially about the important issues, then there
are similarities. The old thought about "we're all climbing the same
mountain, but we're taking different paths" is a really nice metaphor,
and it really appeals to people in populist countries like the United
States, but it's simply not true. The notion that all religions teach
basically the same thing---that we ought to love one
another---demonstrates a serious misunderstanding of world religions.
While most religions have some kind of similar moral code because God
has implanted right and wrong on our consciences, they disagree on
virtually every major issue, including the nature of God, the nature of
man, sin, salvation, heaven, hell, and creation.

\

All that said, we still have to answer the question. *Will any of these
beliefs cause you to go to hell?*

**No.**

The only thing that will save you from your ultimate destination of hell
is accepting Christ as your savior. That's it. You can believe whatever
you want about other religions, but the only thing that will save you
from hell is accepting Jesus Christ and repenting of your sin.
