Regardless of the reason you choose to refuse to pay dues, refusing to
pay dues for any reason results in bad juju for you. You will be charged
late fees, and when your account balance gets large enough, the HOA will
turn your account over to the attorney, and you will face collections
and potential liens on your property until you pay. If your balance gets
large enough, the HOA and the attorney can decide to foreclose on your
property and use the proceeds of the sale to repay what you owe.

Now to the second part of your question. If Board members are
mismanaging funds, what can you do? If your Governing Documents has a
recall provision, you can call for a recall election to remove the Board
member. Your Governing Documents may also have a provision to remove a
Board member from the Board with a certain percentage of homeowner
signatures. My HOA has the latter, and we removed a Board member using
that process (in actuality, we never completed the forced removal, as
the Board member in question resigned in lieu of being forcibly removed
from the Board).

Short of recalling or forcibly removing the Board member(s), just don't
re-elect that Board member(s) at the next election. Remember, there's no
requirement for the Board to do perfect work. If you think you can do
better work, or if you think you can manage money better than the
current Board, feel free to run against them and state your case to the
homeowners. There's no standard for money management for Board members
other than "don't do anything illegal." So if you think you can do
*better*, then feel free to run against them and do better.
