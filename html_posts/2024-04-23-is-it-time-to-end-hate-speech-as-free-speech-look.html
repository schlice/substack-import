It's high time to end hate speech as free speech.

But there's a problem.

*Who gets to determine what is considered hate speech? The government?*
And what happens when the party that you do not support takes control?
And what happens when they define speech that you like as hate speech?

If you go down this road, ***this is exactly what will happen***.

\

The short answer is that **hate speech is free speech.** People have to
be free to say hateful things, hurtful things, things which upset you.
Protecting speech which everyone agrees with is a waste of time, because
*that type of speech needs no protection.*

So how do you counter hate speech if you can't remove hate speech as
free speech?

You counter it with **more speech**. Speak out against the hate speech.
Overwhelm the conversation with rational arguments why the speech is
hateful, and show why it doesn't make sense. That is how you stop hate
speech. Allow the troglodyte to speak, and then destroy him with the
truth.

\

**TL;DR:** You don't end hate speech by banning it. You end hate speech
by allowing it to be spoken, and then destroying it.
