Because some people who haven't passed high school civics think that
laws actually prevent people from doing bad things.

That's not what laws do.

Laws provide penalties when people do bad things. They don't actually
prevent people from doing bad things.

Because if they did, I could pick up the gun, point it at the person,
and try to pull the trigger, but it would simply not work because it's
illegal to kill people. That's not how laws work.

In order for the law to kick in, *you actually have to violate the law
first.*

So for all of you who think that laws prevent people from doing bad
things, here's actually how the process works:

- Law is passed saying you can't do bad thing X or you get consequence
  Y.
- Person does bad thing X.
- Person receives consequence Y.

That's it. The law doesn't stop the person from doing bad thing X. They
always have the choice to be bad. The law simply provides the framework
to allow them to get consequence Y.

\

Therefore, no one *allowed* a transgender influencer to flash her
breasts on the White House lawn. There are rules against that. She broke
those rules. She has received the consequences of breaking those rules.

End of story.
