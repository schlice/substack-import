Original sin is central to the understanding of why we need Christ in
the first place.

Original sin is **the state of sin into which every human being is
born**. The doctrine states that humans inherit a tainted nature with a
tendency to sinful conduct. The biblical basis for the belief is found
in Genesis 3, the story of the expulsion of Adam and Eve from the Garden
of Eden. The garden was established for Adam and Eve to live in, and
they could eat from the fruit of any tree, *except for the two trees in
the middle of the garden.* When Eve took fruit from the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil (and gave some to Adam to eat), they
committed a sin: they broke God's commandment.

From that moment on, mankind inherited a sin nature. This eternally
separated man from God.

And it remained this way until God intervened, sending His Son to earth
to die as a penal sacrifice to atone for our inherited sin.

Without that original sin, we would not need a Savior.
