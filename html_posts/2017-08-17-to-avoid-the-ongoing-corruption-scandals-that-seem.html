Psychological testing already takes ethical decision-making into
account. Additional testing would have to show that there is marginal
benefit for the cost, and to date, additional testing has not been shown
to provide a significant enough marginal benefit for the amount of time
and cost it would add to the pre-employment screening process.

Basically, the testing they have is sufficient to screen candidates to
the level they deem is appropriate.
