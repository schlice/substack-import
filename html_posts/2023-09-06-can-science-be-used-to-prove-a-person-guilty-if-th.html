Depends on your definition of "prove."

Does "prove" mean that we will know, with 100% certainty, that a person
is guilty?

If that's what your definition of "prove" is, then we will never get
there.

The reason: forensic analysis uses the Principle of Uniformity, which
states that causes in the past are the same as causes we observe today.
In other words, by the Principle of Uniformity, we assume that the world
worked in the past just like it works today, especially when it comes to
causes.

But note there we said "assume." Knowledge we gain from inference is
never 100% certain, only highly likely. So *at best*, it can only be
highly likely that a person is guilty. This is why the standard of proof
at trial is "beyond a reasonable doubt." The standard is not "beyond
***all*** doubt."

That is, would a reasonable person, looking at this evidence, believe
that the person is guilty? The jury box is supposed to be full of
reasonable people, so as they evaluate the evidence, they should be able
to say whether or not they believe that the person is guilty of what he
is accused of doing *beyond a reasonable doubt.*

Therefore, we can only "prove beyond a reasonable doubt," we can never
"prove beyond all doubt."
