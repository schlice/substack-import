Yes, JAMCO offers aircraft-rated microwaves.

Why don\'t you find them on most domestic aircraft?

Cost.

When I can roll a cart in, plug it in to power, and achieve the same
effect, I\'m certainly not going to pay to install microwaves.

Also, I have to heat 50 meals. Am I going to rotate them through a
microwave?

I might see something like this installed in a high-end first-class
galley, like something on an Emirates flight, or on a personal aircraft,
or a fractional-ownership fleet.

But I won\'t soon see microwaves on commercial aircraft in economy
galleys.
