**The buyer of my car says his bank is asking for the bill of sale. Is
it safer to give him a purchase agreement rather than the bill of sale
since the car has not been sold?**

Never give out a bill of sale until the car is actually sold.

The bill of sale grants the holder certain powers, including the power
to *invalidate the previous title and print a new one.* All he has to do
is to go in to DMV, show the bill of sale, and tell them that you lost
your title. They re-title the car to the new owner, as indicated in the
bill of sale.

The bill of sale shows that the car has been sold. You don't issue a
bill of sale until the car is sold and money is transferred.

The person is either trying to scam you, or is misrepresenting something
to you, his bank, or both.

No money, no sale. No bill of sale. You transfer the bill of sale at the
same time you transfer the title. In most states, the buyer keeps the
bill of sale and can drive the car ***with no license plates*** for up
to 72 hours (depending on state) after the sale has been made. The bill
of sale indicates the time and date of the sale for this purpose.
