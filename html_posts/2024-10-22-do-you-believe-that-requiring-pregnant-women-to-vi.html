No, I think that is overkill. But requiring pregnant women to visit a
doctor ***at least once*** to confirm that she is not too far along, and
has a pregnancy which can safely be aborted by abortion medication
***should be enforced.*** That should be the minimum standard, in order
to properly safeguard women, and we're not even doing that.

Currently, what started as a temporary hold over from COVID lockdowns,
there is no doctor visit required. Abortifacient drugs can be prescribed
over the Internet and delivered to your house. This has led to
skyrocketing rates of women in ERs with complications from failed
chemical abortions (i.e. pieces of baby left in the womb going septic,
babies which were too old and being incompletely aborted, or worse,
resulting in a torn uterus and internal bleeding).

And roughly half of all abortions today are chemical abortions.
