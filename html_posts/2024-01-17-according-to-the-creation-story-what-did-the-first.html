Penalty. Illogical question. Half the distance to the goal, repeat 1st
down.

Can you see it? Can you see the part that defies logic? I'll bold the
unresolvable contradiction:

"According to the **creation** story, what did the first man and woman
**evolve** from?"

If you are Christian, you believe that man was **created.** If you are
atheist, you believe that man **evolved** from non-living chemicals.

Therefore, according to the **creation** story, there was no
**evolution**.
