**Which country buys most iPhones?**

Manufacturers' market share of smartphone sales in the United States is
led by Apple and Samsung, with a market share of 46 percent and 25
percent respectively, as of the second quarter of 2020. Next to Apple
and Samsung are LG and Motorola/Lenovo, with market shares of 12 and
seven percent.

Samsung had the largest share of the smartphone market in Central and
Eastern Europe in the second quarter of 2020, followed by Xiaomi.
However, Lenovo recorded the most significat increase in sales in that
period. Apple only held a 10% market share in Central and Eastern
Europe.[\[1\]](#lYcoS){#cite-lYcoS .citation_link}

Samsung also led in Asia by 29%, but Apple has caught up to Xiaomi to
hang on to second place with 16 and 14 percent
respectively.[\[2\]](#QBRnO){#cite-QBRnO .citation_link}

**TL;DR: The United States, far and away, buys more iPhones than any
other country, with nearly 50% of the smartphone market dominated by
Apple. Samsung comes in second place in the US, with a seemingly distant
1/4 of the market share there.**
