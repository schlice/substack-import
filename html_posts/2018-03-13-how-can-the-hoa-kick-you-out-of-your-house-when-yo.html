**How can the HOA kick you out of your house when you own it?**

Your HOA cannot directly kick you out of your home. There is a bit of a
legal process. The HOA can do this because while you own your home, the
HOA owns the neighborhood in which your home lives. That means you are
responsible to pay dues to the HOA which controls your neighborhood. If
you break HOA rules, you may get fined. If you fail to pay fines or HOA
dues, the HOA can put a lien on your house for the dues and fines and
lawyers fees owed. You cannot sell or refinance your home until that
lien is paid.

And if the lien goes unpaid for long enough, the HOA can choose to
foreclose on that lien, which means that the home will be sold to pay
the outstanding liens against the house.

You must, as a homeowner, maintain your financial obligations that you
agreed to when you bought your home. Remember that stack of papers you
spent an hour signing (and you never knew you could sign your name that
many times)? One of those was the covenants on file with the City which
says that you agree that the HOA runs the show in your neighborhood and
you have to play along or face financial penalties. You also agreed that
if you don't pay, the HOA can take what you owe out of the cost of the
home. You agreed that the HOA would be the primary non-mortgage
lienholder, and could use your house as the collateral for unpaid HOA
debts. The bank may be the mortgage lienholder, but the HOA is usually
the first non-mortgage lienholder in line behind any mortgage liens. So
even if you're paying your mortgage on time but you fail to pay HOA dues
or fines, you can still have a lien foreclosed, and you can be evicted
and your house can be forcibly sold in a foreclosure sale to cover what
you owe.

*I oversaw two foreclosures for failure to pay HOA dues and fines during
my tenure on our Board of Directors. It's a very lengthy process, but we
worked as closely with the homeowner as they would allow. In one case,
we worked out a payment plan with the homeowner which allowed him to
stay in his house. In another, the homeowner simply wouldn't play nice
at all. Tangentially, he ended up going to jail on a DV charge. A real
sweetheart, that one. We threatened to foreclose, and while we were
preparing to file, the bank decided to foreclose which meant we got paid
without paying for the foreclosure. Phew.*
