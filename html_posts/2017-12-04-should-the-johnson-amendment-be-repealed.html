The Johnson Amendment should be *clarified*, not *repealed*.

We should definitely say that you can't spend Federal tax-free dollars
on political campaigns. There is a definite conflict of interest there.
Thankfully, most churches have never wanted to publish pamphlets about
political candidates, and while they have probably wanted to donate
money to candidates, this should rightly be prohibited.

However, allowing pastors to discuss the religious aspects of candidates
in a Sunday sermon is *not* a political campaign. Unlawfully denying the
1st Amendment rights of pastors is patently unconstitutional.

There are plenty of tax-exempt organizations (think 501(c)3) which are
allowed to make political positions known, and there are no restrictions
on them. The Johnson Amendment *only* applies to churches, which makes
it a 14th Amendment violation.

Additionally, controlling speech by leveraging the government's taxing
authority unconstitutionally controls the practice of religion. A
religious organization cannot freely practice religion because of the
government, which is a clear 1st Amendment violation.

The whole point behind making churches tax-exempt in the first place is
that *the power to tax is the power to control*. To avoid even the
pretense of a 1st Amendment violation, it's better to not tax churches.
However, this tax-exemption doesn't force a church to give up other
rights in the Bill of Rights, and your 1st Amendment rights are not "for
sale" through tax rules. The tax exemption provided to churches doesn't
give the government the right to regulate their speech.

"If you want to talk about politics, just give up your tax exemption!"
What other rights in the Bill of Rights do you think should be
contingent on receiving a tax exemption from the government? What other
organizations in the country do you keep under the same restriction?
Regulate your speech or we'll remove government program X. It's a clear
violation of several parts of the 1st Amendment, as well as a violation
of the 14th Amendment.

The Johnson Amendment should be clarified to state that churches cannot
contribute tax-exempt money to political candidates, but their 1st
Amendment rights cannot be infringed.
