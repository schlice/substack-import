Ah, I think I've found the problem here. **You honestly have no idea why
the police exist, who they work for, and what they do.** It's a common
problem, but it in no way affects what the police are required by law to
do. Your lack of knowledge, or your misinformation, regarding the
police, does not in any way change how they do their job.

The one point you made that has any validity and veracity at all is that
the police exist to do a job no one else would want to do. That much is
absolutely true. The police are there to remind people like you that
**there are consequences to your actions.** That's why people don't like
to see the police: because everyone wants to live by their own rules,
and no one wants to be held accountable when they violate the law.

Nevertheless:

- You cannot disobey the law and expect nothing to happen.
- You cannot ignore the lawful directives of a peace officer and expect
  nothing to happen.
- You cannot simply claim the system is corrupt while attempting to live
  as a productive citizen within that system, benefiting from its
  product.

If a peace officer gives you a lawful directive (that is, any directive
while acting as an agent of the state), whether or not you recognize the
authority of the state, you are required by law to obey that directive.
A police officer may use force to compel your compliance with that
directive. Shortened and dumbed down, this is how the interaction with
the police will go, in order:

- I ask you to do it
- I tell you to do it
- I make you do it

But one way or another, you will do it. I will listen with compassion to
your sob story, but at the end of the day, *you will still do exactly
what I told you to do.* The level of force required and the level of
pain you experience is **directly** proportional to the level and amount
of resistance you provide to the officer attempting to do his job, the
job **we the people** gave to that officer.

Oh, you didn't tell him to do that job? Actually, yes you did. When you
said you wanted to live in a free society, you also said that you don't
want anyone to mess with your freedom. So laws were passed which ensure
that your freedom doesn't encroach on someone else's freedom. And when
someone violates those laws, we have enforcement which brings those
lawbreakers to account for their crimes in front of a duly appointed
judge. You'll never see the inside of a courtroom if you follow the law.
But if you willingly violate the law, the police will take you to see
the judge, who will decide what happens to you.

That's all, no more, no less.

The harder you resist, the more it's going to hurt. But it only hurts
when you resist. Stop resisting, and it stops hurting. It's all up to
you, not the officer.

I'm really disinclined to address the remainder of your "comments," and
I will caution you that you are on the bleeding edge of a BNBR
violation. I could report you for your last little rant, but I'll assume
that you simply "didn't know" and you know now. So a word of warning:
don't spout that hateful crap again; it's a one-way ticket to being
banned from this site.
