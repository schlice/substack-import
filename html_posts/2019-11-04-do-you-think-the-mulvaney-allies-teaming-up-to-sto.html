We\'ve discussed this before regarding the impeachment probe and their
requisite subpoenas.

The United States has **three co-equal branches of government. No one
branch has authority over another.**

*So how can Congress issue subpoenas?*

When one branch has a Constitutionally-authorized function to carry out,
it can subpoena information and testimony from the other branches.

But what if the other branch has its own Constitutionally-authorized
function that *it* is trying to carry out? Which
Constitutionally-authorized function wins?

At this point, it\'s up to the courts to decide. Which branch wins? Is
it Congress and their one-sided impeachment probe, or is it the
Executive branch and their claim of Executive Privilege? Only a court
can tell.

So if Congress intends to continue driving enforcement of these
subpoenas, their next stop is to the US Attorney\'s office and a hearing
before a Federal judge, where both branches of government actually get
to be fairly represented.
