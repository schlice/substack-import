No, I don't think so. I think atheists can be just as hateful and
judgmental as theists.

Sure, there are some atheists who live more morally than many
Christians, and there are some Christians who live more morally than
many atheists.

And there are plenty of Christians who wrongly believe that their
judgement is somehow acceptable because they are saved, and the atheist
is not. Clearly, this is the Christian's problem, and they are
absolutely wrong for thinking this way. But this "moral high ground"
fallacy works both ways. Some atheists believe they are more moral
because they don't wrongly judge, but believing this places them in the
position of being the arbiter of morals, since they have no foundation
for their purported morality.

But I don't think there's anything special about Christians which makes
them especially more judgmental than atheists.
