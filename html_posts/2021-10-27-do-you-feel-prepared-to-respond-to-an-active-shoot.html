Absolutely!

And you should too. If you don't, remember the following:

**RUN, HIDE, FIGHT**

Let's talk about these, in order. If you find yourself in an active
shooter situation:

1.  **RUN**. Get out if you can. Don't worry about going into off-limits
    areas. If you're in a restaurant, head for the kitchen and go out
    the back door. If you're in the mall, look for the maintenance
    hallway that leads to a service door. If you're on the ground floor
    of a building, look for a window you can open if you can't find a
    door. Once you find an exit, get as many people out as you can. Run
    a good block away from the scene and call 911.
2.  If you cannot get out, **HIDE**. Take cover. Try to find a room with
    only one entrance/exit. Maybe someplace you can barricade yourself
    inside. Take inventory of what you have in the room. Look for
    anything you can use as a weapon if you must, but then hunker down
    and stay put. Don't break cover until the police arrive. If you can,
    stay on the phone with 911 throughout.
3.  If the bad guys find you, do not hesitate, **FIGHT**. If you're not
    armed with a gun, arm yourself with whatever you have at your
    disposal. Coat racks, broken furniture, whatever you have. If you
    don't have anything you can use, attack with your fists and feet.
    Remember: **you** are the weapon, not the tool in the hand. Ignore
    the gun and fight for your life. Do not stop until one of you is
    dead, and oh by the way, make sure it's him.

Learn this. Memorize this. Don't forget it if you ever find yourself in
an active shooter situation.
