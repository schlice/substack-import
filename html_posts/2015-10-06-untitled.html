**Content:** [*We need to change from a sense of entitlement to a form
of earned reward.*\
\
That\'s the problem with rights, isn\'t it. You are never \"rewarded\"
with a right. You are rewarded with a privilege. Privileges are earned,
and can be revoked. Neither of those conditions apply to rights. Rights
are natural and are bestowed just by being a citizen. They are
\"unalienable\" because you can never not be human, so you can never
lose those rights.\
\
*You can owen the AR-15, but first you need to take this weapons safety
and handling class and prove you can responsibily shoot the thing.*\
\
There are no requirements in order to be able to exercise your rights.
In fact, if you impose such a standard, you actually *restrict* the
right to people who can afford the safety and handling class, which is
thus unconstitutional because it prevents an entire class of citizens
from being able to exercise their rights.]{.rendered_qtext}
