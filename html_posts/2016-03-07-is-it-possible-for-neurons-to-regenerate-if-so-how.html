Neurons can live for a hundred years, and while it is true that we can
make new ones, it\'s also true that this process does not happen quickly
or easily. That\'s why we are born with about 100 billion neurons,
because we will need them for our entire lifetime.

I don\'t know how long it takes a neuron to regenerate in an adult, but
I do know that the process is a slow one.
