As with any legal answer, this one is also "it depends."

Depending on your jurisdiction, the rules of your parole *may* allow
**police officers** to search your home without a warrant. But in nearly
every jurisdiction, **parole officers** and/or **probation officers**
can search your house without a warrant.

Typically, when you are paroled, you sign what is known as a "Fourth
Amendment Waiver." This means that for the duration of your parole, you
give up your Fourth Amendment rights regarding search and seizure. In
practice, in most jurisdictions, this means that any police officer or
parole officer can walk up to you any time they have a suspicion you are
engaging in criminal activity and search you. Periodic random house
checks conducted by your Probation Officer (PO) are often part of the
terms of parole as well. And if you refuse or resist in any way, or in
the case of probation fail to notify your PO of the contact, they can
not only arrest you for violating your probation or parole, but they can
also charge you with whatever they found.
