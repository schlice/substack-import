**Content:** [You remember Capt [[Chesley
Sullenberger](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8331dc&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesley_Sullenberger){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"

qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}? I always bring
[[Sully](https://www.quora.com/topic/Chesley-Sullenberger)]{.qlink_container}
up as he is a fellow grad. Does it matter that Sully graduated the year
I turned 1? Nope, not a bit. Not to a grad, anyway.\
\
If you recall, US Airways Flight 1549 had both of its engines disabled
by striking a flock of Canada Geese on takeoff out of LaGuardia on
January 15, 2009. Capt Sullenberger successfully ditched his aircraft in
the Hudson River, saving all 155 passengers and crew aboard.\
\
Aircraft fuselages, engines, and windscreens are routinely tested to
withstand bird strikes using the \"[[Chicken
gun](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=42df39&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_gun){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}\" which fires whole, dead
chickens (preferrably not frozen) at aircraft windshields and engines,
as chickens have been found to accurately mimic the characteristics of a
bird strike by a live, fully-grown bird.]{.rendered_qtext}
