1.  **GET A LAWYER.**\
    You must make sure you ***KNOW*** your Governing Documents. In order
    to do so, you should get your Governing Documents reviewed by an
    attorney, even before you consider filing a lawsuit. You must
    understand exactly what the Governing Documents allow your HOA to
    do, and what they prevent your HOA from doing. Next, you must know
    exactly what your HOA did, and finally, you must be able to
    articulate how what they did violates the Governing Documents. This
    is what a lawyer helps you with. They can review your HOA's
    Governing Documents in light of your state's laws and review the
    HOA's actions to make sure you actually have a case that has a
    chance of winning.
2.  **HAVE MONEY.\**
    Suing your HOA will not be cheap. You may prevail in the end (and
    the HOA may be forced to pay your attorney's fees, depending on what
    state you live in), but until then, you're on the hook for your
    attorney's fees. And if you lose, you may end up paying *their*
    attorney's fees. So if you're living paycheck-to-paycheck, maybe a
    costly lawsuit isn't in the cards for you yet.
3.  **BE PREPARED TO LOSE.**\
    What happens if you lose? Are you going to continue to live with
    your HOA? Or are you going to move? Will you comply with their rules
    in the future?\
    \
    Also, while it's a bit tongue-in-cheek, *what will the neighbors
    think?* Will they think your lawsuit is frivolous? Will they be okay
    with the HOA having to spend **their dues money** to mount a defense
    against your lawsuit, even if they ultimately prevail? This kinda
    goes hand-in-hand with what happens if you lose.\
    \
    Don't get me wrong; this doesn't mean that you don't retain the
    right to sue. But just because you have the right to do something
    doesn't alleviate you of the consequences of your actions, which
    could include being ostracized from your own neighborhood.
4.  **CONSIDER ALTERNATIVES.\**
    You might consider alternatives to lawsuits, such as binding
    arbitration. This is less expensive than a lawsuit, but still
    effective at getting you results.
