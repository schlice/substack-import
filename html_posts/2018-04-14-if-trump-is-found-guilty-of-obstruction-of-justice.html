**If Trump is found guilty of obstruction of justice or collusion and is
indicted, could he avoid the consequences of the indictment until his
term is over?**

The only way Trump can be found "guilty of obstruction of justice or
collusion" is through impeachment.

And impeachment is only one half of the equation. The Senate would then
need to vote to remove him from office, which won't likely happen even
if he is impeached. This means that effectively, nothing will happen.

Example: Bill Clinton.
