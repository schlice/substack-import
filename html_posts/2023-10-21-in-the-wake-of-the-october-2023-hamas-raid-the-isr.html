Not sure where you get the line that Israel simply lied about all of
this. Hamas admitted to kidnapping women and children. They published
photos of themselves with raped and killed women. They published photos
of themselves with beheaded babies. Hamas did all of this on their own;
Israel didn't have to goad them into doing it.

But Hamas was going for *shock value*, which indeed they got.

What they didn't expect was for Israel to not respond with *more of the
same*. Instead, Israel is going to *steamroll all over Gaza*.
