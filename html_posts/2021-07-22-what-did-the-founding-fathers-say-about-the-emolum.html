Since I'm assuming you are not talking about what they "said" in the
Constitution, let's look at everything that is *not* the Constitution,
such as the Federalist Papers, the Articles of Confederation, state
constitutions, and usage in the early republic.

I would refer you to [[this
paper](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0140f0&url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id%3D3487898){.external_link

on the topic.

In a nutshell, when the framers talked about "emoluments," they were
looking specifically at the salary and benefits derived from holding a
government office. **The term was specifically not applied to profits
related to non-government business or investments.**

It would be challenging to think that non-government business or
investments should be included in that definition, because that would
mean that any president who ever invested in any company which did
business with the government would be in violation of the clause.
Additionally, the emoluments clause doesn't just apply to the president,
but to every member of Congress, and indeed, every Federal "office of
profit or trust." That means that every one of them who invests or does
business with any company which also does business with a foreign
government would be in violation of the clause.
