An excellent question!

The Bible is unclear about where exactly Jesus was for the three days
between His death and resurrection. Peter talks about it briefly:

> For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the
> unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the
> flesh but made alive in the spirit, in which he went and proclaimed to
> the spirits in prison, because they formerly did not obey, when God's
> patience waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared,
> in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through
> water. --- 1 Peter 3:18--20 ESV

So in Peter's account, Jesus went to the "prison for spirits," which
would be hell or Hades. He "proclaimed" to them there. We don't know
what He proclaimed (because they died in disobedience to God so they are
not saved). He probably told them that He would soon triumph over death,
and that He will eventually cast Satan into Hell.

Ephesians 4:8--10 also has some clues:

> Therefore it says, "When he ascended on high he led a host of
> captives, and he gave gifts to men." (In saying, "He ascended," what
> does it mean but that he had also descended into the lower regions,
> the earth? He who descended is the one who also ascended far above all
> the heavens, that he might fill all things.)

In this passage, Paul says that Jesus "led a host of captives." What
most people believe is that Jesus brought Abraham, David, Joshua,
Daniel, the beggar Lazarus, the thief on the cross, and everyone else
who had previously been justified by faith, and led them from Hades (the
abode of the dead in general) to their new spiritual home.

Other than that, the Bible is mostly silent on what Jesus did between
His death and resurrection. The Bible is, though, abundantly clear on
where Jesus and all believers were (and will be) after His resurrection.
