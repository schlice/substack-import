I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but it's not just atheists who
deserve to go to hell. In fact, ***it's everyone***.

We ALL deserve to go to hell.

We are ALL sinners and we have all fallen short of the glory of God
(Romans 3:23). We ALL deserve to go to hell.

But, by God's mercy, we do not get what we deserve. And by God's grace,
we get what we do not deserve: eternal life with Him.

Now, that offer is both **unconditional** (meaning it is offered freely
to anyone) and **conditional** (it is conditioned on you doing
something).

So what's the condition?

You have to accept Christ as your Savior. You have to acknowledge that
He died to save you. You have to believe in His salvific act on the
cross.

He's holding out a gift for you to take. And all you have to do is take
it. We cannot *earn* our salvation. But we can *take* the free gift we
are being offered. It will change your life, but most of us would say
that that would be a good thing. A free gift that costs you your life.
