**Who do you report a police dispatcher to if they\'ve got an attitude
with a caller on a non-emergency number, and could they be tracked
through a phone call made to them?**

Depends on where you made your call.

Some dispatchers work for the police department. Others work for a
regional 911 authority, especially when the 911 service covers multiple
departments and jurisdictions. Here in Colorado Springs, our 911 system
is run by a [[regional 911
authority](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cdd2b9&url=http://elpasoteller911.org/){.external_link

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="elpasoteller911.org"}]{.qlink_container}, as we have seven
call centers which cover two counties, six police departments and
sheriff's offices, five fire districts, and four military installations.

You'll have to do an Internet search for 911 in your area, and you'll
usually be able to find information on who runs your local 911 service.
As an alternative, you can call your police department's
**non-emergency** line (it should be on your city's website or, if you
still have one, the blue pages of your local phone book) and ask them
who runs your local 911 service.

Once you've found the agency which runs your local 911 service, you'll
want to talk to a supervisor and inform them you'd like to make a
complaint. You can absolutely track your 911 call based on your phone
number and the date (and approximate time) you called. During most 911
calls, you provide your number. This is primarily for call-back purposes
in case you get disconnected before the natural end of the call.
However, the number is recorded in the notes for the call, and so you
can use the number to locate the call, and thus locate the operator.
