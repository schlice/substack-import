Bladder problems are a big issue with MS. It\'s one of the most common,
actually. Bladder problems are present in around 80% of MS patients.
Incontinence is one of the possibilities, but so too is inability to
urinate or completely empty the bladder.

**Incontinence** can be very effectively treated with medication.
There's more than a dozen different medications available to treat
incontinence. Talk with your doctor about your symptoms so that the two
of you can choose a medication that may be right for you.

There are other treatments available, including:

- Physical therapy, including pelvic floor strengtheing
- Percutaeneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) is a therapy which has
  been shown to reduce urinary frequency, urgency, nighttime urination
  and incontinence. In this therapy, a small needle is inserted next to
  the tibial nerve in the ankle, stimulating the nerve. Sessions
  generally run 30 minutes a week for 12 weeks.
- InterStimÂ® is a small device surgically implanted under the skin that
  stimulates the sacral nerves and is used to treat overactive bladder,
  urinary retention and some types of bowel dysfunction.

**Inability** to completely empty the bladder is another MS-related
bladder issue which can cause bladder infections and other secondary
problems. Besides pelvic floor physical therapy, intermittent
self-catheterization can help people who have difficulty emptying their
bladder completely. There are also medications available which can help
to relax the muscles surrounding the urethra and to aid in stimulation
of the muscles around the bladder. Working with your doctor on any of
these treatments will be important in finding which one will be right
for you.

Other surgical interventions are also available for when a patient does
not respond adequately to any of these therapies.
