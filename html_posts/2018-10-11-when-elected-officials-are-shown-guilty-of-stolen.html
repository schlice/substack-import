**When elected officials are shown guilty of Stolen Valor, how should
they be held accountable?**

The correct accountability method is to not re-elect that official.

You can also *recall* that official from state office (if your state has
provisions for such a recall election), or for US government officials,
you can urge the body to look into impeachment.
