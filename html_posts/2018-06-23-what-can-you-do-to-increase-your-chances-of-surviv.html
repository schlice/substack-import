**What can you do to increase your chances of surviving a mass
shooting?**

Like [[Chris
Knox](https://www.quora.com/profile/Chris-Knox-4)]{.qlink_container}, I
used to advocate the Run, Hide, Fight method.

Today, I advocate the "Move! Escape or Attack" method. It's essentially
an incremental improvement on Run, Hide, Fight (RHF) which allows you to
be more flexible in an active shooter situation.

- **Move!** When people are not used to high-stress situations, they can
  freeze up. Instead of saying anything else, we say "Move!" to try to
  break that vapor-lock. Moving to cover or concealment is the first
  step. Get out of the line of fire, get to a place where you can stop
  and analyze the situation. Moving first to an area of cover or
  concealment is appropriate.
- **Escape or Attack**. The problem with RHF was that "Fight" was listed
  only as a last resort, after hiding failed and your position was
  breached by the attacker. This fails to allow for any flexibility. You
  only hide if you can't run. And you only fight if you can't hide or
  your cover is blown. Escape denotes thoughtful movement towards an
  exit (and non-traditional exits must be considered, i.e. windows, fire
  doors, loading docks, or service areas not normally accessible to the
  public), whereas Run can be blind running, and it may not lead you to
  an exit. Run may not be purposeful, while Escape is a direct action
  leading to an exit.\
  \
  Attack is listed as equivalent to Escape, since it's not only
  applicable if Escape fails. Attack gives you an emotional advantage
  over Fight, which can be defensive in nature. Attack is a deliberate
  forceful proactive action. It's appropriate to orient a person into an
  aggressive posture to immediately counter a threat.
