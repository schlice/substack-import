It does not appear that HBO Go is supported on Vizio Smart TVs. Note
that HBO Go (the service included with a traditional HBO subscription
through your cable or satellite provider) and HBO NOW (the standalone
service you can purchase at any time) are both supported on the same
list of devices.

Clearly, there is either an incompatibility between Vizio's system of
apps and the HBO apps, or there is a contractual issue between HBO and
Vizio that is preventing the app from being fielded on Vizio TVs. This
normally has something to do with supportability and how much access
Vizio demands to HBO's code, and vice versa. For example, HBO may demand
more control over their own software (i.e. for support or upgrade) than
Vizio is prepared or even able to offer. If they can't reach an
agreement on those points, the app doesn't get fielded. Note that I do
not know the actual reason why the HBO family of apps is not on Vizio
Smart TVs; I am merely explaining why these apps sometimes don't make it
on. I don't know if Vizio and HBO are working to get their apps natively
supported within Vizio's app framework. This is all just general
information.

It looks like you will have to use a compatible streaming device to use
HBO Go or HBO NOW, such as an Apple TV, Chromecast, Amazon Fire TV or
Fire TV Stick, or a compatible gaming console (PlayStation or Xbox).
