As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."

The specifics will always be found in the individual HOA's Governing
Documents.

In some smaller HOAs, the Board maintains this responsibility. In
others, the management company will routinely patrol and note
violations. In still others, the HOA appoints a committee to handle
violations.
