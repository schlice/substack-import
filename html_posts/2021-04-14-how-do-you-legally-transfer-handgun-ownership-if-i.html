**How do you legally transfer handgun ownership if its gifted? My dad
wants to give me his 9mm. We arent sure how we do this. Neither one of
us are felons and we both have our license to carry that is required by
the State of Indiana.**

To the best of my knowledge, Indiana is not a "universal background
check" state.

So how do you gift someone a firearm in Indiana?

DAD: Here you go.\
YOU: Thanks!

That's it.

If you want to make it all official-like, you can do what's known as a
"Gift Letter" which indicates that he gifted the firearms to you and he
reasonably believes you to not be a felon or an adjudicated mental
deficient. Sign and date, keep for a few years.

But private transfers in Indiana do not require background checks.
Neither do private sales, but in that case, I'd do a firearms bill of
sale and keep that.
