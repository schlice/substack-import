**How do you tell if you\'re talking to an undercover cop?**

You: Are you an undercover cop?\
Undercover cop: Yes.

That's about it. Other than that, you'll never know the person you're
talking to is an undercover cop.

All kinds of people will tell you that they "know the signs" of an
undercover cop. But they don't. There is no surefire way to tell if a
person is an undercover cop unless they tell you.
