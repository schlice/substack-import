**Content:** [In the United States, if a suspect dies before he can be
tried, and there is no other accused, the state has no case, and the
charges are dismissed.\
\
However, it sounds like the tenor of your question (who pays after him)
is seeking retribution for a crime. In the United States, it\'s called
the \"Justice System,\" not the \"Vengeance System.\" It is about
*justice*, not *retribution.* If you\'re looking for payback, look
elsewhere.\
\
Since the person died before he was found guilty, he has repaid his debt
to society through his death, and there is no one else who needs to pay.
Society has its justice. If you still feel slighted after he has died,
perhaps you can seek a civil judgment against his family or something
similar.]{.rendered_qtext}
