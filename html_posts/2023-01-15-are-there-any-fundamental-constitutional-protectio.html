Of course! It's the same Constitutional protection that protects anyone
from double jeopardy:

> No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous
> crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except
> in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when
> in actual service in time of War or public danger; **nor shall any
> person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of
> life or limb**; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a
> witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or
> property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be
> taken for public use, without just compensation. --- 5th Amendment, US
> Constitution

The bolded section in the 5th Amendment is the protection against double
jeopardy. In a criminal trial, jeopardy attaches when the jury is
impaneled. In a civil trial, jeopardy attaches once the first witness is
called.

Once jeopardy attaches, unless the case does not conclude, the
government cannot appeal or re-try the defendant.

Conditions which constitute "concluding" the case:

- After the entry of an acquittal, whether:
  - a directed verdict before the case is submitted to the jury,
  - a directed verdict after a deadlocked jury,
  - an appellate reversal for sufficiency (except by direct appeal to a
    higher appellate court), or
  - an \"implied acquittal\" via conviction of a lesser included offence
- re-litigating against the same defence a fact necessarily found by the
  jury in a prior acquittal, even if the jury hung on other counts. In
  such a situation, the government is barred by collateral
  estoppel.[\[1\]](#YLspn){#cite-YLspn .citation_link}
