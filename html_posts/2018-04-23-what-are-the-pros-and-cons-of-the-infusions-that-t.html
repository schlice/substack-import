**What are the pros and cons of the infusions that treat multiple
sclerosis? I'm worried about the side effects.**

I spent 18 months on Tysabri.

On the plus side, it controlled my MS better than any other medication I
was on before, or have been on since. In fact, while I was on Tysabri,
my brain was actually able to heal, and some of my lesions *shrank*.

On the downside, Tysabri is broken down by the liver. That's not
necessarily a bad thing, except my depression medication that I was on
at the time was *also* broken down by the liver. The liver's level of
processing is reactive in that as medication increases that the liver
needs to break down, the liver takes some time to ramp up its action.
Same is true when the medication level reduces. This means that for a
week or so, the liver will either be breaking down too much, or not
enough.

Consequently, I was good for the first few weeks following my infusion.
But as the level of Tysabri started to taper off, my liver was working
too hard and it broke down more of my depression medication than it
should have. Result: mood swings. *Extremely unpleasant* mood swings.
Not for me, but for everyone else around me. You could always tell when
it was a week before my next infusion, or so I was told.

I know you've heard already about the risk of PML. Remember that you
only risk PML if you are JC positive. I have been (and continue to be)
JC negative, so there was no risk of PML for me. Your mileage may vary.

I didn't have any other adverse reactions to the infusion. I would get
the infusion before lunch, and be back to work in the afternoon.
