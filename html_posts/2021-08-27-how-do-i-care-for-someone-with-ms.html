The answer is "it depends."

Every person with MS is different, and they all have different needs.
They all have different "levels" of need as well. Some will need more
hands-on assistance, while others will simply need emotional support and
the love and care of a friend or family member.

If instead, you are finding yourself overwhelmed and not knowing where
to turn for help with caring for someone with MS who requires special
care, there is help. Start with [[your local chapter of the National
Multiple Sclerosis
Society](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2ebc99&url=https://www.nationalmssociety.org/Chapters){.external_link

the [[MS Society of the
UK](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7adc24&url=https://www.mssociety.org.uk/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"

country's MS Society. Reach out to them, and they can assist you with
finding resources who can help you care for someone with MS.
