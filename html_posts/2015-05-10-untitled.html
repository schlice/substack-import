<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [The major difference between the U.S. and the UK: the U.S.
government doesn\'t have the authority to enforce state law. Only a
state-based police force has the authority to enforce state law. The
federal organization has the ability to enforce only federal laws.\
\
In the United States, we are a federation of independent states. We
cannot, under the Constitution, be served by \"national police.\"\
\
That looks too much like the U.S. military enforcing civilian law, and
no one wants that either.]{.rendered_qtext}
