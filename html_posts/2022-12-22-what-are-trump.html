I'm not supposed to reveal this information. In fact, I could be
executed simply for confirming that Trump's Orders™ actually exist.

But the truth is that Trump orders all Republicans to believe everything
that he, the Great Leader, says. We must deny that any tax evasion took
place, even if evidence is provided. And if it is, we are to claim that
it is FAKE NEWS. We must proclaim that Trump was the Best President
Ever,™ even better than Lincoln or Washington.

Trump actually ordered Elon Musk to embed Republican monitoring software
into Twitter, so the Great Leader can see what we say about him on every
platform we use on our phones. I've heard some others saying (in hushed
voices so that the Great Leader doesn't catch on) that he can hear what
we say through our phones, *even if we're not in a phone call.*

I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to get you information. I'm
sure they're coming for me as I write this. Somehow, the Great Leader
seems to know everything I type before I type it...

So let me just say this really quickly right now: if it is learned over
the next few days that I "committed suicide," I DIDN'T COMMIT SUICIDE! I
WAS MURDERED BY THE TRUMP HIT SQUAD! TELL THE WORLD OF MY CAUTIONARY
TALE!!!
