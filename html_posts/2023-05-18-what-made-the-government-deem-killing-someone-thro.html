Because sometimes it is legally justified to take a life.

If killing another human being was **never** justified in any
circumstance, then there would be no right to self-defense which
includes the use of deadly force. But there are several circumstances in
which killing is justified, and one of those circumstances is
self-defense.

In the United States, you have the right to life. This right to life
means that no one has the right to *unjustly* take your life from you.
And if you cannot defend your life, then do you really have a *right* to
life at all?

Therefore, the right to self-defense flows from the right to life. You
have the absolute right to defend your life with whatever tools you have
at your disposal, including tools that impart deadly force.

Additionally, someone seeking to *unjustly* take your life *forfeits*
his or her privilege to be secure in their right to life. In other
words, if you seek to take someone's life, your own life is forfeit.

It is also a well-established principle of true self-defense that you
can meet **force with force**. You can apply an equal force being
applied to you to your assailant. A valid self-defense structure permits
this.
