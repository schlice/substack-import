Let me first answer the question as it was asked, and then I'll answer
the hypothetical you were *trying* to ask.

\

If I was falsely accused, you'd still have to prove beyond a reasonable
doubt that I did what I was arrested and charged with doing, and that's
a tall order if it didn't really happen. A false accusation isn't
getting me sent to jail; it's most likely going to get me fired from my
job, but won't get me sent to jail, and certainly not for ten years. So
this particular scenario (a false accusation leads to jail time) is
really unlikely. The false accusation would have to have enough credible
evidence to get me arrested, and if the accusation is truly false, there
wouldn't be enough evidence to arrest me.

\

Now, you were probably trying to ask if a false accusation that did get
me arrested **and convicted** were to happen, which would I prefer. So
as I already said, this is going to be a really unlikely hypothetical,
but I'll play along to answer the question.

Clearly, since testicles produce bodily hormones, removal of the
testicles would sentence me to a lifetime of hormone replacement
therapy, but on the upside I wouldn't have to do TSEs anymore. If you
don't know what I mean by that, then you probably don't have testicles
of your own.

So yeah, much better to go to prison; considering the prisons are so
overcrowded, with my good behavior I'd probably only do a third of that
sentence inside, and the rest at home.
