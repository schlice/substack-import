Primary Progressive MS is a form of MS which is characterized by
continually worsening symptoms, with or without relapses.

This graph shows what disease progression could look like for a patient
with PPMS, but remember that each person's personal experience with the
disease is unique. PPMS can have periods of time that the patient is
stable (no active symptoms and no disease progression), the disease is
not active (no change in symptoms) and either is or is not experiencing
disease progression, and there can be periods of time where the disease
is active (in a relapse or active disease process) and either is or is
not experiencing disease progression.

Approximately 15% of people who are diagnosed with MS are diagnosed with
PPMS.
