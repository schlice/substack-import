Well, when you put it ***that*** way...

What Israel *actually* did was to destroy a Hamas terrorist stronghold
in Jabaliya, northern Gaza, which happened to be located under an
apartment building. As usual, Hamas hides behind civilians.

And just so we're clear, the Geneva Conventions say that when you build
a military facility inside of a civilian facility, the facility then
becomes a legitimate military target.

Anyway, the IDF killed about 50 terrorists and destroyed the entrances
to some of Hamas' network of tunnels, where they keep munitions, and
plan and launch attacks. Additionally (as you noted), Ebrahim Biari, who
was Hamas\' commander of the Jabaliya center battalion, was killed in
the airstrike.

If you want to know why refugee camps were targeted, you'll have to ask
Hamas why they place military targets underneath civilian structures, in
clear violation of the Geneva Convention and other international rules
of war.

(EDIT) Apparently, lots of people are unaware of the history of the
people in Gaza, claiming that there can't be a "refugee camp" in Gaza.
This has already been answered in the comments, so I'll add it here to
answer you before someone else, again, says that you can't have a
refugee camp in Gaza:
