**I have a friend who says men should be the protectors. Is there
anything wrong in Biblical terms with women being in the military?**

This is a great question. What does the Bible say about women in the
military?

The Bible doesn't have a lot of entries regarding women in military
positions. That's because only men were counted to go to war (Numbers
1:2--3, 1 Samuel 8:11, Genesis 14:14--15). Wives and children did not go
to war (Deuteronomy 3:19--20). Daughters served in domestic roles (1
Samuel 8:13). Women welcomed men back from war, they did not return with
them from war (1 Samuel 18:6--7).

When discussing women in the military, the Bible doesn't rely on *gender
roles* as much as it reinforces the role of a *wife* and *mother*. The
Biblically-correct interpretation is to understand that the primary role
of a woman ***in a family*** is as a wife and mother. Military service
may involve deployments, which would interfere with a married woman's
highest responsibility: a wife and a mother. A single woman should have
no such duties placed upon her, so it is likely Biblically acceptable
for a single woman to be in the military.
