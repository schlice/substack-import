I think you don't know the difference between **responsibility** and
**accountability**. **Responsibility** is about the actions of a person
or group, while **accountability** is about being answerable for the
results of those actions.

So to that end, is Trump ***responsible*** for those deaths? Clearly,
**no**. Trump does not control the weather (crazy conspiracy theories
notwithstanding). Therefore, Trump did not make it flood. He is no more
***responsible*** for the deaths in the flooding than I am. Full stop.

\

Now, is Trump ***accountable*** for those deaths? That's a much more
nuanced question.

First, most disaster preparedness is controlled by the **state**, not
the feds. The feds are there as backup, and the feds can release
emergency aid money to the state if their finances get overwhelmed. But
by and large, disaster preparedness (and subsequent recovery) is the
responsibility of the state emergency management office and the governor
(they're the ones who take the action). The feds don't step in unless
they're called.

So the first line of *accountability* (the ones answerable for the
result of those actions) belongs with the Director of the Texas Division
of Emergency Management. I'd be reviewing that office to ensure that all
possible avenues of prevention were being exercised. Did the disaster
plan get activated? Did it include contact to all the residents? Were
those contact attempts ignored?

*(EDIT) It appears that all relevant warnings and emergency
notifications were, in fact, distributed. Some of the accountability
will have to fall on the people who ignored those warnings and did not
evacuate as appropriate. That's a hard truth, because it always comes
across as "victim blaming," but the truth doesn't care about how it
comes across.*

Then next, clearly, would be the governor of Texas. Did he ensure that
TDEM had all the funding and support it needed? Was he in constant
communication with the TDEM director? Was the National Guard spun up and
ready to go if they were needed? Did he appeal in a timely manner to
FEMA as required, if it was needed?

Then, after **all other accountability** has been distributed, whatever
is left falls on Trump, as the Chief Executive for the country. Did FEMA
respond appropriately? Were emergency funds released as appropriate?
Whatever accountability remained would be on Trump, as "the buck stops
here" on the President's desk.

\

TL;DR: Trump may, at some level, own some small accountability for the
deaths, but he does not own the vast majority of the accountability, and
was **most certainly not responsible.**
