**Do private clubs, private organizations have the right to determine
who may join?**

Yes, with caveats.

Private clubs and organizations can make rules about who may join.
However, they may not be exclusive in violation of the law. The Civil
Rights Act of 1964 makes it illegal to discriminate on the basis of
race, color, religion, biological sex, or national origin. Additionally,
some states and cities have gone further and added sexual orientation to
their own civil rights laws.
