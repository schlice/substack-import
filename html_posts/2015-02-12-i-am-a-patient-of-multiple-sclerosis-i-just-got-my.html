**Content:** [If you are not experiencing any issues, your lesions are
called \"silent\" and the majority of lesions you experience will be
this way.\
\
The report doesn\'t suggest a good or bad prognosis. But if your lesions
with \"significant resolution\" appear with contrast dye, then the
lesions are active. This may be a sign that your medication is not
working for you, depending on how long you have been taking it.\
\
But that determination (whether or not you are making good prognosis)
should be made between you and your neurologist.]{.rendered_qtext}
