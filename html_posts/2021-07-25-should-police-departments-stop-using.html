Tasers are "less-than-lethal" devices. On most healthy individuals, when
employed correctly, they do not cause any serious or lasting harm.

But some people, especially those with pre-existing medical conditions,
can have those conditions exacerbated by the Taser, and in some cases,
people have died from its use.

That's not a reason to stop using it.

Think about it. You're advocating removing a "less-than-lethal" force
implement, and replacing it with...?

Nothing?

Meaning that if the police must escalate their level of force above
pepper spray, they move to *lethal force* which is called that because
it is designed to kill.

Removing something from the force continuum and not replacing it with
anything is never a smart idea. Leaving officers with fewer options will
only result in **more** deaths, not **less**.

Original question:

Should police departments stop using \'stun guns\' as non-lethal
deterrents due to the deaths caused by them?
