**Why do people do a vasectomy in order to escape unwanted children and
abortions?**

I made a decision to not risk exposing further children to the spectre
of Multiple Sclerosis.

Now, I'm fully aware that the risk isn't very high. The average person
in the United States has about a 1 in 750 (.1%) chance of developing MS.
For first-degree relatives of a person with MS, such as children,
siblings or non-identical twins, the risk rises to approximately 1 in
100 to 1 in 40 (2.5-5%).[\[1\]](#fpiZx){#cite-fpiZx .citation_link}

I have already, unknowingly, subjected three children to the higher risk
of developing MS. My youngest child was born in 2002. I was diagnosed in
2005. The risk of exposing my children to an increased risk of MS was
something that we chose to avoid.

So I got "fixed," and I didn't even know I was broken.
