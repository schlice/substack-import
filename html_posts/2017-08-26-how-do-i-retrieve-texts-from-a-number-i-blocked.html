I think your only option is to check with your cell carrier, because
there is virtually no way to retrieve messages from blocked numbers on
your device.

Depending on where the blocking was done (at the handset or at the
service), the carrier might have a record of the texts. If the message
was delivered to your handset and *then* discarded, the carrier would
have that. If the message was blocked at the carrier, they won't have
the record, either.

Short answer: check with your cell phone carrier's customer service
department.
