**Why are President Trump's supporters attacking the Virginia restaurant
that refused service to Sarah Huckabee Sanders?**

Businesses can refuse to serve anyone for any non-protected reason, as
long as they are *consistent* with their behavior.

As long as they deny service to *every* government employee, they are
legally okay. But denying service to *one* government employee and not
*all* of them is inconsistent, and is probably something the law would
refer to as *discrimination*. The Civil Rights Act made discrimination
illegal. Just as you can't discriminate against a person simply because
you don't like what they're wearing (unless you don't allow that article
of clothing in your establishment at all, regardless of who is wearing
it), you can't discriminate against a person simply because you don't
like them personally, or you don't like what they do for a living.

While she may have a good case for a discrimination lawsuit, she
probably will just drop it.

And in a free-market economy, people have the right to protest and
boycott the restaurant for its treatment. That's how we should be
dealing with these types of issues: with our wallets.
