In general, unless the facility has a policy prohibiting photography in
a sensitive area, the rule in the United States is "if you can see it,
you can shoot it." Most areas in which ticketed passengers are allowed
in an airport are okay for pictures, as far as I am aware. There may be
some restrictions around TSA screening checkpoints; this will be posted
at the checkpoint.

Whether or not the photo will be admissible in court is another matter
altogether, and I don't think it was the thrust of the question, so I'll
leave that up to the judge and your lawyer to argue.
