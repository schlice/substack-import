**Are there any further consequences after a president is impeached?**

Yes.

Once the House passes Articles of Impeachment, they are forwarded to the
Senate for trial. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court presides as the
judge over this trial. The trial is used to determine whether or not the
President is to be removed from office because of the impeachable
offense that the House found.

A supermajority of Senators (67) must vote to remove the President from
office in order for it to happen. If a supermajority of Senators do not
vote for removal, the President may finish the remainder of his term
(ref: Impeachment trial of Clinton, William Jefferson).

**Once that is done,** which is what I think you really were asking,
there is no further consequence. The trial is over, and either the
President is removed from office, or he is not. If he is removed from
office, the Vice President serves as President for the remainder of the
President's term in office.
