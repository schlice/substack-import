**Why haven\'t gun rights advocates backed up their claim that they are
mainly trying to prevent the government from over-reaching their
authority, but yet have not come to the defense of children being caged
or blacks being brutalized by government?**

I'm a gun rights advocate.

- I'm highly against placing children in cages at any time.
- If you can show me some proof that blacks are being brutalized by the
  government, I'd be against that, too.

However, as it stands, both of those claims have been shown to be false.
I haven't seen any real evidence that either exists. And if your "proof"
is news reports, you can forget it. Too much fake news. You can't rely
on the media to give you facts.

That said, you don't have to be a gun rights advocate to either support
or oppose placing children in cages or brutalizing blacks. This is
what's called a *false equivalency*. One doesn't have anything to do
with the other.

Unless you have some proof of this, your false equivalency is what's
known as a "logical fallacy." Logical fallacies don't make good policy.
