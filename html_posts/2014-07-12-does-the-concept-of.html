<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [It\'s very unlikely that armed civil war between the<br>populace and the military (which is completely illegal) or police would<br>ever take place. The [[United States Armed<br>Forces](https://www.quora.com/topic/United-States-Armed-Forces)]{.qlink_container}<br>are forbidden to act against US citizens by the [[Posse Comitatus Act of<br>1878](https://www.quora.com/topic/Posse-Comitatus-Act-of-1878)]{.qlink_container}<br>and the Insurrection Act. According to those laws, there would have to<br>be a civilian uprising that a fully-constituted state militia could not<br>control before the US armed forces could be engaged legally, not the<br>other way around.\<br>\<br>And if such an event were to occur (the government ordering the US<br>military to fire on its own citizens) you\'ll find a lot of military<br>personnel believing that to be an illegal order and refusing to follow<br>it. Those two laws, which have been around since the beginning of the<br>nation, would need to be repealed in order to legally engage the<br>military against the civilian populace.\<br>\<br>The police feel the same way. The police are there to protect and serve,<br>not to enslave and oppress. You\'d find very few officers actually<br>following such an order, and most likely, the whole lot would turn on<br>the government and force an armed revolution.\<br>\<br>Similarly, I don\'t think that people believe that their semi-automatic<br>rifles stand any chance against fully-automatic weapons and<br>mass-casualty weapons (rocket launchers, grenades, anti-personnel<br>claymores, etc). People understand that an armed populace will fight for<br>their rights. One anonymous poster said that<br>[tyranny(https://www.quora.com/topic/Tyranny)]{.qlink_container} is<br>when a group lacking legitimacy uses force to impose its will. What<br>about a group that loses its legitimacy? What if our President were to<br>unilaterally order US troops to engage any US citizen with a gun? This<br>would be highly illegal, and the President would therefore lose his<br>legitimacy, because he would be acting outside of the<br>law.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
