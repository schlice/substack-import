**Content:** [It\'s very unlikely that armed civil war between the
populace and the military (which is completely illegal) or police would
ever take place. The [[United States Armed
Forces](https://www.quora.com/topic/United-States-Armed-Forces)]{.qlink_container}
are forbidden to act against US citizens by the [[Posse Comitatus Act of
1878](https://www.quora.com/topic/Posse-Comitatus-Act-of-1878)]{.qlink_container}
and the Insurrection Act. According to those laws, there would have to
be a civilian uprising that a fully-constituted state militia could not
control before the US armed forces could be engaged legally, not the
other way around.\
\
And if such an event were to occur (the government ordering the US
military to fire on its own citizens) you\'ll find a lot of military
personnel believing that to be an illegal order and refusing to follow
it. Those two laws, which have been around since the beginning of the
nation, would need to be repealed in order to legally engage the
military against the civilian populace.\
\
The police feel the same way. The police are there to protect and serve,
not to enslave and oppress. You\'d find very few officers actually
following such an order, and most likely, the whole lot would turn on
the government and force an armed revolution.\
\
Similarly, I don\'t think that people believe that their semi-automatic
rifles stand any chance against fully-automatic weapons and
mass-casualty weapons (rocket launchers, grenades, anti-personnel
claymores, etc). People understand that an armed populace will fight for
their rights. One anonymous poster said that
[[tyranny](https://www.quora.com/topic/Tyranny)]{.qlink_container} is
when a group lacking legitimacy uses force to impose its will. What
about a group that loses its legitimacy? What if our President were to
unilaterally order US troops to engage any US citizen with a gun? This
would be highly illegal, and the President would therefore lose his
legitimacy, because he would be acting outside of the
law.]{.rendered_qtext}
