If a doctor were to violate state law and provide an illegal medical
service, that doctor would risk fines and loss of his or her license to
practice medicine.

Depending on the state, doctors may also face civil suits from
individuals (I'm thinking of the Texas law) for providing abortions in
controversion to state law, which could result in fines of up to
\$10,000 per occurrence.
