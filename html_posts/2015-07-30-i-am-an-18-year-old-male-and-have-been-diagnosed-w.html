**Content:** [You have a disease. Your life isn\'t over. You just get
\"extra\" challenges to deal with.\
\
If you had a physical handicap, like if you were missing an arm, would
you be able to live happily and positively, knowing the problems you
were going to be facing? Sure you could get a prosthetic, but it\'s not
the same, and they are not easy to live with. You\'re always going to be
missing an arm. But you can work around the problem and still live a
normal life.\
\
MS is the same. You can fight the disease. You can take one of the
approved MS treatment drugs and slow down the disease progression.
You\'re always going to have MS, and eventually down the road it\'s
going to cause you more issues than you have now. But you can work
around those issues and still live a (mostly) normal life.\
\
Look, everybody\'s got \"something.\" For some people, it\'s alopecia.
For some, its obesity. For others, it\'s low self-esteem. One way or
another, everyone is dealing with someone.\
\
What matters is not the size of the obstacle you have to overcome. What
matters is the fact that you work to overcome your personal obstacles,
whatever they are. Sir Edmund Hillary didn\'t look up at Everest and
say, \"Whoa, that mountain is too high to climb, I\'m out.\" He worked
at it and eventually climbed the mountain.\
\
You\'ll have to tweak some things to live a mostly normal life, but this
is just a roadblock; a bump in the road. It\'s not the end of the road.
It just means the road you\'re traveling is a little bumpier than others
your age. Don\'t give up the journey; improve your
suspension.]{.rendered_qtext}
