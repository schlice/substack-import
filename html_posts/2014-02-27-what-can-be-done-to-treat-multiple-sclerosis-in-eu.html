**Content:** [The only difference between the EU and the US is what
medicines and protocols are approved. Most recently, Lemtrada
(alemtuzumab) was approved by the EU and the FDA, surprisingly, rejected
the drug. Alemtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets certain T
and B cells, leaving other immune cells alone. The T and B cells in
question are thought to be the ones that cause the inflammatory response
in MS.\
\
Part of the problem we (the worldwide MS community) face is the
ever-changing landscape of both drugs that are available and the tests
that prove the drugs are safe and effective. Those studies take time. I
don\'t think that any one region of the world has a corner on the study
market, so I think that we are all progressing as quickly as we can,
while still trying to maintain some level of safety.]{.rendered_qtext}
