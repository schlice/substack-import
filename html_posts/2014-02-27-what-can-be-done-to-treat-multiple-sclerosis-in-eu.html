<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The only difference between the EU and the US is what<br>medicines and protocols are approved. Most recently, Lemtrada<br>(alemtuzumab) was approved by the EU and the FDA, surprisingly, rejected<br>the drug. Alemtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets certain T<br>and B cells, leaving other immune cells alone. The T and B cells in<br>question are thought to be the ones that cause the inflammatory response<br>in MS.\<br>\<br>Part of the problem we (the worldwide MS community) face is the<br>ever-changing landscape of both drugs that are available and the tests<br>that prove the drugs are safe and effective. Those studies take time. I<br>don\'t think that any one region of the world has a corner on the study<br>market, so I think that we are all progressing as quickly as we can,<br>while still trying to maintain some level of safety.]<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
