You said you share "copyleft picture quotes" but then you apply your
page watermark. It sounds like you could be heading for trouble.

A "copyleft" is intended to be the opposite of a "copyright." Instead of
all rights to the image being reserved, on the contrary, all rights are
freely given to redistribute the image, so long as any derivative works
are also freely given.

So why a copyleft instead of just releasing something to the public
domain?

In the public domain, anyone can similarly use the image. But public
domain works can be re-packaged into proprietary works, which can then
be subject to copyright.

Copyleft works are specifically prohibited from being re-packaged into
any derivative work for which a copyright can be applied. Copyleft says
that anyone who redistributes the image, with or without changes, must
pass along the freedom to further copy and change it. Copyleft
guarantees that every user has freedom.

If the original image is subject to "copyleft," you are free to
redistribute it, re-package it, and even modify it, so long as the same
"copyleft" applies to the image.

In other words, you cannot watermark the image unless it is a "copyleft"
watermark. You cannot restrict redistribution of a copyleft image by
placing your own copyright on it. This violates the letter and the
spirit of a copyleft.
