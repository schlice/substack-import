**Why is the case of a Dallas cop who accidentally entered a neighbor's
house and killed him being presented to a grand jury?**

For Federal cases, the Fifth Amendment reads, \"No person shall be held
to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a
presentment or indictment of a grand jury\[.\]\" At the federal level, a
grand jury indictment is required.

Many states still require a grand jury before a prosecution can move
forward. Some states allow filing by information in addition to a grand
jury, and still other states have done away with the grand jury
altogether. In the past, the grand jury served to screen out malicious
or incompetent prosecutions, but ever since we have had official public
attorneys acting as prosecutors for the State, the grand jury has been
largely irrelevant.

Texas requires the use of the grand jury.

**Can a district attorney overrule a grand jury's decision?**

It depends on the jurisdiction. In states where grand juries are
required, if the grand jury rules "ignoramus" or "not a true bill," the
prosecution cannot proceed, and if the grand jury rules "true bill," the
case automatically proceeds to trial.

In Texas, if the grand jury rules "true bill," the case will
automatically proceed to trial. The District Attorney cannot override
the will of the grand jury.
