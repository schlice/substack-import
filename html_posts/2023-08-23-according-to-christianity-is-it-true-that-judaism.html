Yes.

But this isn't unique to Christianity. Every religion which makes truth
claims (all of them) believe that their claims are true.

And if absolute truth exists, then the opposite of truth is false.

Therefore, if my religion is true, then every other religion which is
not my religion is false.

There's nothing surprising or earth-shattering about this. This is just
common sense.
