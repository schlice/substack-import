**Why do police come to your home for hit and run and arrest you, and if
you do not pay your traffic ticket issued by police then police arrest
you on your next traffic stop in the USA?**

I'll discuss these two cases separately, and I'll give you the example
of the state of Florida because that's where I live, but laws vary from
state to state.

In the case of a hit and run, you have graduated from a traffic
infraction to a crime, so they come to your house and arrest you. If you
leave the scene of an accident in which there were no injuries, this is
a second degree misdemeanor and carries a sentence of up to six months
in jail and a fine up to \$500. If you leave the scene of an accident in
which someone was injured, this is a third degree felony, and you could
face up to five years in prison and a fine of up to \$5,000. If you
leave the scene of an accident in which someone died, this is a first
degree felony, and you could be facing up to 30 years in prison, and up
to a \$10,000 fine.

Not paying traffic tickets gets you to arrest in a different way. When
you get a traffic ticket, you have two choices: you can pay the fine, or
you can appear in court to fight the ticket. You must do one: pay the
fine, or appear in court. If you fail to pay the fine, and you fail to
appear (FTA) in court to fight the ticket, the judge can issue a "bench
warrant" to bring you into court to explain yourself. Generally, the
bench warrant isn't enforced right away. If you are stopped again, the
bench warrant will appear, and you will be arrested because there is a
warrant out for your arrest. You will then appear before the judge and
not only answer for why you failed to pay your ticket, but why you
failed to appear in court.
