**How big does a jury have to be? I used to think 12, but then served on
a jury with less people.**

You're not the first person to ask that question. The answer is *as big
as the state thinks it should be, but not fewer than six.*

The seminal case surrounding jury size is *Williams v. Florida*, a case
that came before the Supreme Court in 1970, alleging (among other
things) that Florida's 1967 law reducing the size of a non-capital jury
from 12 to 6 was a violation of the 6th Amendment.

The court found (obviously, based on your experience) that it does not.

The court said that the 6th Amendment did not mandate a set number of
jurors. The primary function of a jury is to prevent abuses by
government officials:

> *Providing an accused with the right to be tried by a jury of his
> peers gave him an inestimable safeguard against the corrupt or
> overzealous prosecutor and against the compliant, biased, or eccentric
> judge.*[\[1\]](#ljSVE){#cite-ljSVE .citation_link}

The functions of a jury, the court found, could be just as effectively
carried out by six members as it could by twelve:

> *\[T\]he essential feature of a jury obviously lies in the
> interposition between the accused and his accuser of the common sense
> judgment of a group of laymen \[\...\] The performance of this role is
> not a function of the particular number of the body that makes up the
> jury.*[\[2\]](#qUpDj){#cite-qUpDj .citation_link}

Later, in *Ballew v. Georgia,* which was heard in 1978, the Supreme
Court found that a Georgia law allowing for a jury of five members was
indeed unconstitutional.

State laws, therefore, cannot limit jury size to less than 6 members,
but states can create juries of as few as six and still be
Constitutional.
