While I am a conservative and a Trump supporter, I'd ask to see any of
the proof you have that the DNC can be even indirectly tied to either
assassination attempt.

What ***can*** be tied to both attempts is the unhinged rhetoric from
the left describing Trump. In fact, it is alleged that the second
assassin was *directly* influenced by that rhetoric.

It's stuff like Biden telling his supporters that they needed to "put a
bulls-eye" on Trump. It's the left equating Trump to Hitler, saying that
Trump is an "existential threat to democracy." All it takes is one (or
two) unhinged individuals to *take them seriously.*

And as Charlie Kirk [[said today on

"They're going to keep trying to kill Trump," he said.
