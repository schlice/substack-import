**Why did Brett Kavanaugh refuse to shake the hand of the father of a
Parkland school shooting victim?**

In the *one second* in which that photo was taken, Judge Kavanaugh was
being escorted out of the chamber by Secret Service.

Someone approached him, from behind, and stuck out a hand.

He turned around, surprised to see someone approaching him in the
chamber, as Secret Service is telling him to leave. He didn't expect to
be stopped by anyone. He expected to get out of the chamber as quickly
as possible.

And in that second of misunderstanding, someone snapped a picture. The
timeframe that he didn't understand what was going on was literally one
second. You see it all happen if you *watch the video* instead of
looking at the picture.

Context is everything.

Don't forget, the Left is literally grasping at straws right now. They
can't stop Kavanaugh's nomination, so they're going to try to

they have at this point. So they're grasping for anything they can to
effect their Bork. If they can't Bork him, they can at least telegraph
to their base that they're doing everything they can to forestall the
process, and potentially showcase their nominees for 2020 #resisting.

"Doing everything they can" includes taking a photo out of context.
