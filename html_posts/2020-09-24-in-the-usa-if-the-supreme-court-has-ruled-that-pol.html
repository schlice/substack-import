**In the USA, if the Supreme Court has ruled that police have no duty to
protect, do I have the right to act?**

The short answer is yes.

The longer answer is *you have a right to protect yourself, because the
police are under no obligation to protect* ***you****.*

The courts have indeed ruled that law enforcement generally does not
have a federal constitutional duty to protect one private person from
another. For example, if a drunk driver injures a pedestrian or a drug
dealer beats up an informant, agencies and their officers usually would
not be liable for those injuries because there was no duty to protect.
In 1989 the U.S. Supreme Court stated, \"Nothing in the language of the
Due Process Clause itself requires the State to protect the life,
liberty, and property of its citizens against invasion by private
actors.\" Generally, the Due Process Clause does not provide an
affirmative right to government aid, \"even where such aid may be
necessary to secure life, liberty, or property interests of which the
government itself may not deprive the individual.\"

There are two exceptions to this rule: the **special relationship**
exception, and the **state-created danger** exception.

The **special relationship** exception exists when the police have
created a special relationship with an individual. This usually happens
when the police arrest someone. In that scenario, the person is unable
to defend themselves, and must rely on the police to protect and defend
them.

The **state-created danger** exception happens when officers leave an
individual in a situation that is more dangerous than the one in which
they found him, by creating a previously non-existing danger or
increasing the danger. For example, leaving a woman to walk home, alone,
in the dark, while she was clearly intoxicated, is a state-created
danger, but no state-created danger existed when a designated driver was
arrested on a warrant and allowed to drive his car to the police
station. His passengers, who were drunk, remained unattended in the car
outside the police station for about 30 minutes, drove off, and were
involved in a fatal crash. The Court reasoned that a claim had not been
stated, as it was not reasonable to find that the arresting officer
\"knew or should have known that the two passengers were drunk and unfit
to drive."

So now that you know that the police are not there to protect you, what
does that mean? This means that **your protection is your
responsibility**. You are responsible, first and foremost, to protect
yourself and your family. No one else. That job falls on you.
