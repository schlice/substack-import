Exceedingly unlikely.

See, these confirmation hearings are no longer about *Senators* learning
anything about the nominee. They may have already met with her in
private. They have teams of researchers looking into everything from her
family life to her legislative history. They don't *need* these
hearings.

These hearings are much more about *the American people* learning
something about the nominee, and also possibly about the Senator. They
are also a stage where potential Presidential candidates can get a few
sound bites recorded (see Booker, Cory and Harris, Kamala, during the
Brett Kavanaugh confirmation hearings).

These hearings are nothing more than a glorified dog-and-pony show.
Judge Barrett needs only get in there, say that she won't talk about how
she will potentially rule on any particular issue, talk about her
values, talk about her judicial record, and that's it. She should avoid
other entrapment-style questions like the plague.

And then Senators are going to mostly vote along party lines, with few
exceptions (if our RINOs are feeling spry, they may vote against the
candidate, but that's not enough to stop this train from rolling), and
she will be confirmed.

Original question:

***Is there anything Amy Coney Barrett might say in her SCOTUS
confirmation hearings that would change any senator\'s mind about how to
vote?***
