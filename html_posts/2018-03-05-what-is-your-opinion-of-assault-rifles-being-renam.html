**What is your opinion of assault rifles being renamed as \"people
killing machines\"?**

It's like renaming "cars" as "people moving machines." Except that in
the case of guns, it's designed to inflame.

**Let's be honest. If you didn't know by now that guns are people
killing machines, you must have been living under a rock until now.**

This is only "news" to the people who are swayed by "news."

And it's only relevant if there is never a valid reason under which a
person can be killed.

In the United States, there are at least two valid reasons under which a
person can be killed: *self-defense* and *resistance to tyranny*.

Poo-poo on those ideas all you want, but according to the Constitution
and subsequent case law (many decades of it), those two are actual, core
functions of the Second Amendment.

*Since killing a person is reasonable and not unlawful in at least one
circumstance, why would you not use the most efficient "people-killing
machine" to which you had access to do it?* You'd want to use the
machine which had the best chance of stopping whatever violent act you
were trying to stop, with the smallest amount of possibility that you'll
accidentally harm someone other than your intended target.

Guns put a tremendous amount of force on a person with near pinpoint
accuracy. They take a little bit to master (like cars), but once you do,
you can apply tremendous force at standoff distances, with nearly zero
risk of harm to the operator.
