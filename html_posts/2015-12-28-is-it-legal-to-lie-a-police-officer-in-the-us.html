In some cases, you may not lie to the police. For example, when
questioned, you are required to give your real name and other personally
identifying information. The police can (and often do) detain you until
they have positively identified you.

As far as anything else goes, you are perfectly free to lie to the
police. You can\'t be convicted of \"telling a lie.\"

Understand, though, that every time you lie when you are talking to the
police, you probably are providing false information. You could be
charged with \"obstructing justice\" or \"obstructing a public
official\" or \"presenting false evidence.\" That doesn\'t make it
*illegal* to lie. It simply means that depending on the situation, it
might be in your best interest to *not* lie, or better yet, to not talk
to the police at all. If your lie deliberately impedes a police
investigation (by sending the police away from, instead of towards, the
actual criminal), you could be charged with any number of worse crimes
than obstructing, including \"accessory after the fact,\" or \"aiding
and abetting.\"

In other words, if it\'s in your best interest to not talk to the
police, don\'t. It\'s better to say nothing than to lie. You\'ll end up
far worse off if you lie to the police than if you don\'t say anything
at all.

Note that I didn\'t talk about whether it\'s a good idea to not
cooperate. I simply am comparing saying nothing at all to saying things
that are not true.
