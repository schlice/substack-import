In general, (and this is very, very general), it is legal to sell tools
for security testing. In general, whether or not it is legal for people
to own such tools varies by state, but ultimately you are mostly immune
from prosecution if people use your tool unlawfully. If you\'d like a
comparison, look at the firearms industry. They build tools to kill
people, but if someone uses their tool to kill someone and that killing
was unlawful, the manufacturer is immune from liability.

You are going to have to be very diligent with your EULA, and you are
going to have to have your EULA reviewed by an attorney, as well as
having your business model and your tools evaluated by an attorney. The
attorney will have to tell you whether or not it is legal to develop the
tool, whether or not it is legal to sell the tool, and how you should
craft your EULA to ensure that you are insulated against unlawful use of
your tool.
