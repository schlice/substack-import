The vast majority of Christians do not have a religious basis to oppose
vaccinations. There are no denominations of Christianity which have come
out in opposition to vaccines, and actually, many churches and
denominations have publicly endorsed them. So it will be an uphill
battle for a Christian to request a religious exemption.

We are indeed concerned about those who are not sincerely religious
abusing the waiver system in order to avoid vaccination. Abusing the
waiver system threatens the ability to receive waivers at all, including
for the people who truly need it. Some states are looking at removing
religious exemptions completely because of the influx of people seeking
religious waivers.

Some Christians may object to the fact that the vaccine was tested using
cells which were derived from an abortion in the 70's. This is a valid
exception, but in order to substantiate this exception, these Christians
must also show that they have rejected every other vaccine which was
tested on those cells, such as the vaccines against Chickenpox,
Hepatitis A & B, Typhoid, Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR), Polio, Rabies,
and Shingles. Otherwise, their opposition to the COVID-19 vaccine on
those grounds might be seen as inconsistent, and may even be regarded as
being made in bad faith. Granted, many of those vaccines may have been
administered while the person was a baby (so it was outside of their
personal control), but any vaccine which was tested on those cells for
which they had personal control, during the time that they were active
in their faith, should have also been similarly rejected.

Before a Christian refuses a vaccine on religious grounds, they should
do some very serious investigation to see if they actually have the
grounds to request the exemption. Requesting religious exemptions when
they do not apply harms others who have actual religious exemptions by
unknowingly abusing rules that are meant to protect others.
