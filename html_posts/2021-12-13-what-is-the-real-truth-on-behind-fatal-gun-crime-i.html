So here's the generalized numbers about people who get shot.

- You usually hear the 33000 number bandied about, this is the average
  number of people per year who die by gunshot. That's a pretty broad
  category, because it doesn't address *why* they were shot. The Brady
  Center likes to break this one down to make it even scarier: Every
  day, 316 people are shot. Technically that's true, but it's really
  misleading. And by the way, that includes people who were shot and
  survived.
- Indeed, that same number includes almost 22,000 people per year who
  die by suicide, and the gun was their chosen method. It's not the only
  method chosen, but in the United States, it is the most popular. Other
  countries see other methods used for suicide instead of guns.
- This leaves about 11,000 people who die by gunshot. In about 8000
  cases, these are **criminal-on-criminal** shootings. This is bad guys,
  killing bad guys, while in the midst of doing bad things. This
  includes drug deals gone bad, gang rivalries, and other illegal
  activities.
- This leaves about 3100 people who die every year from gunshot who were
  not suicides or criminals killing criminals while doing criminal
  things. About 1000 of these every year **are killed by police**, and
  the vast majority of these people were either armed or were attacking
  the officer in question.
- This leaves about 2100 people every year who die of gunshot who were
  not suicides or criminals killing criminals while doing criminal
  things, or killed by police. About 500 people are accidentally killed
  from gunshots. Roughly 325 die but the intent was unknown.
- This leave about 1275 people who die every year of gunshot wounds who
  are the actual victims of crime. The vast majority of these are caused
  by domestic disturbances where the assailant had a relationship with
  the victim. The rest are victims of crimes against the person.

Think about that. In a country of 330 million people, only 1275 die in
actual crime where they were not participating in criminal activity
themselves. That means in any given year, you have a 0.0003864% chance
of being one of those people. So unless you are a gang member or you are
a criminal, your chance of encountering gun violence is *vanishingly
rare*.

This doesn't mean we are *unconcerned* with this violence. Far from it.
We are very concerned with this. We just know that **the gun is not the
cause of the issue**. The *person* is the cause, not the *gun*. And
removing the gun does not make people nicer. Just look at any country
who claims that their gun violence death is so low. Ask them "Sure, but
what is your rate of violence regardless of tool used?" and watch them
recoil and backtrack.
