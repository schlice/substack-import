**Now that Giuliani has publicly declared that he has no intention to
respond to a congressional subpoena, do you think he should be arrested
immediately?**

Certainly not.

Remember that we have **three co-equal branches of government**. Two of
them are asserting privileges that they believe they legally have:
Congress is claiming they need information (testimony or documentation)
to conduct their Constitutionally-mandated oversight mission, and the
White House is claiming that it has Executive Privilege to guard certain
key information from release.

*Neither of these privileges takes precedence over the other*, as both
branches are equal in their authority over each other.

It would be up to Congress to bring their "subpoena" to a Federal court
in order to enforce it. The subject of the subpoena would then have the
opportunity to present their case to show why the information needs to
be protected, and it would be up to a judge to decide.

*If* a judge decides that the subpoena can be enforced, *and* the White
House continues to fail to comply, ***then*** the Congress can move the
subpoena to the US Attorney's office in DC, which will petition a judge
to issue arrest warrants for the subpoenaed individuals. The judge will
engage US Marshalls to enforce compliance.

(EDIT) My comments section just got spammed with people who seem to
believe that because Rudy Giuliani is not a Federal employee, that
somehow executive privilege does not apply.

This belief is incorrect.

**Executive privilege is not about** ***people*. Executive privilege is
about** ***information*.**

It does not matter who holds that information. It's only been Federal
employees in the past because under normal circumstances, only Federal
employees have been privvy to the information which needs to be
protected.

But anyone who is in possession of information which the Executive deems
privileged can be ordered to not release that information. Even if they
are civilian attorneys.

The question then becomes what can the Executive do if the non-Federal
employee fails to comply with the Executive's demand to suppress the
information. That would be an interesting turn of events.
