**What are your HOA's by-laws or declarations regarding owning a home
business?**

Most HOAs allow home-based businesses. However, the HOA would be
concerned whether or not your HOA would increase traffic into and out of
the neighborhood or required parking outside of what a single family
residence would support. Any home-based business which caused traffic to
increase into the neighborhood would not be permitted. But simply owning
a home-based business is generally not prohibited.
