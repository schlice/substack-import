You should always talk to your doctor before you make decisions about
vaccines, and you should consider your current health situation and your
current medications, and any other risk factors you may face. Don't ask
the Internet if taking a vaccine is a good idea.

*In general* (not specifically for you), the vaccine is beneficial for
most healthy people. In general, the vaccine reduces your chance of
contracting the virus, and if you do, you have a greater chance of only
experiencing mild or moderate symptoms. You *greatly* reduce your risk
of being hospitalized with the virus if you get the vaccine.

Bottom line: if you're thinking about getting vaccinated, talk to your
doctor or healthcare provider, but the vaccine is generally beneficial
for most people.
