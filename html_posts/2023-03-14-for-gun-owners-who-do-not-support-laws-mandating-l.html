I can see both sides of the issue. If your guns are secured, they are
inaccessible to you in the event of an emergency. In order to be
prepared for an emergency, you must unsecure your firearms to make them
ready.

On one hand, I think that technology has advanced to the point where we
can have safe firearms storage but still have rapid access to it.
Personally, I wear bracelets all the time. I have a few bracelets which
are so important and personal to me that I never take them off unless
I'm in the shower. So I'd have no problem wearing a bracelet with an
RFID chip to open a gun safe with the wave of my hand. Biometrics are
becoming more reliable and more accurate as we progress, although I'm
not quite sold on that yet. Nevertheless, I think we can say that we can
safely secure our personal home defense firearms but still have rapid
access to them.

The problem comes when we **mandate** such storage. And there are indeed
several problems with this, but the biggest is *liability*. What happens
if someone gets into my safe, steals a gun, and kills someone with it?
Because my safe storage failed or didn't work properly, somehow now I
become liable for their actions. And in the minds of most gun owners,
the only reason to mandate safe storage is so that we have someone to
blame, other than the shooter, for the shooter's bad actions. This
leaves a very, very bad taste in the mouths of gun owners. No gun owner
with a conscience wants unauthorized people to get their hands on their
guns and use them to commit crimes. It's *doubly bad* when you now
become *criminally liable* for someone else's bad choices. Only the
criminal is criminally responsible for the criminal's criminal conduct.
Transferring criminal liability to others is a bad thing.

The other issue is one of Constitutionality.

- If a firearm is secured, it cannot be used for one of its lawful
  purposes (self-defense), which makes the law, *de facto*,
  unconstitutional. And I can guarantee you that a safe storage law will
  not have any provision for lawful use, because that defeats the
  purpose of a safe storage law. For example, how close to my firearm do
  I have to be in order to leave it unsecured? Must I simply be in the
  same house? Does it have to be within arm's reach? Each one of these
  exceptions to the safe storage law opens up a hole for an unauthorized
  person to get hold of a firearm, which limits the law's usefulness.
- If you mandate purchasing a gun safe along with purchasing a gun (and
  some gun safes rival the cost of the gun in price), you are pricing
  the poor out of the gun market, arguably the people who need guns the
  most for self-defense. Excluding an entire class of citizens through
  mandatory price increases is also unconstitutional.
