Charles Manson's crime was **not** filling people's heads with bullshit,
as that is not a crime. Otherwise, thousands and thousands of people on
radio and television would be guilty of that crime.

Manson was convicted in 1971 on seven counts of first-degree murder and
one count of conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of Abigail Ann
Folger, Wojciech Frykowski, Steven Earl Parent, Sharon Tate Polanski,
Jay Sebring and Leno and Rosemary LaBianca.
