**Content:** [The answer is that you may or may not be able to find out
the information about the trial.\
\
Contact the clerk of the court and provide the defendant\'s name and
date of trial, and as long as the verdict is not sealed, the clerk of
the court should be able to provide you with the verdict.\
\
Since the defendant was under 18, they may not have tried him as an
adult. If he was tried as a YO, his court records are sealed. But since
he\'s so close to 18, and he committed an aggravated \"top 5\" he may
have been charged as an adult, in which case his trial information will
be public.\
\
(The top 5 are murder, arson, rape, robbery, and
kidnapping)]{.rendered_qtext}
