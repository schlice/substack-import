**Can Congress allow witnesses to remain anonymous to the public?**

Yes.

Congress is free to conduct its investigations in whatever way it sees
fit, or to conduct no investigation at all and proceed directly to
voting on Articles of Impeachment.

But that wouldn't play very well with the general public. It would make
it seem like they didn't do their due diligence. Hence, hearings.

But let's see how many Representatives change their votes by the time
all of this dog-and-pony show is done. We'll use that to determine how
worth it the investigations were to Congress.
