**Is it possible to attack the police in self-defense?**

First of all, you can never "attack" in self-defense. So no, attacking
in self-defense is never lawful. That's attack, never self-defense.

Secondly, while it is physically possible to defend yourself from a
police officer, that's not really the question. The question is whether
or not you will be charged for doing so.

In most cases, police officers act under "color of law." That means that
if they are doing their jobs (something you also really can't tell at
the scene), they are presumed to be acting lawfully unless a court says
otherwise.

And that's the real rub. You can't tell whether or not a police officer
is acting lawfully until a court determines it. It is only a court that
can make that determination, not you, not your sidewalk lawyer, not the
Internet. Just a court. So an officer acting under color of law is
presumed to be acting lawfully until the courts says otherwise, so you
"resisting" or "defending yourself" is unlawful.
