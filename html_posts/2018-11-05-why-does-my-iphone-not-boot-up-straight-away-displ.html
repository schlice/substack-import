**Why does my iPhone not boot up straight away (displays the red battery
symbol) when I try to switch it on after plugging it in because the
battery ran flat?**

To protect the circuitry of your phone, your battery must have a minimum
charge before the processor will begin the boot sequence. Generally,
this is around 5% battery.

Therefore, the phone will sit at the red battery symbol until it is
charged to a minimum level. Once it hits that level, the boot sequence
will begin.
