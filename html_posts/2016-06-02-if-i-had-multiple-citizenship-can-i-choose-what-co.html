The only thing that dual (or multiple) citizenship gives you is the
right to live in either country without having to immigrate.

Once you have chosen a country to live in, you are required to follow
all of the laws of that country. Citizenship is not what determines
which set of laws you get to follow, presence does.

Consider this example. As a tourist visiting another country, I'm still
bound by the laws of the country I'm visiting. Violating those laws
would get me thrown in that country's jail. Claiming ignorance will only
get you so far. Claiming that you're not bound by that country's laws
because you're not a citizen will get you nowhere at all. At best, it
will get you a one-way ticket home.
