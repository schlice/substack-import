**You're absolutely right.** Jesus doesn't take away your sin. You are
still guilty of your sin. No one can take your sin away from you. Even
when you die and stand before the throne of judgement (Romans 14:10--12)
you will be a sinner, and you will be guilty of all of your sin.

But for Christians, that's not the end of the story. Because next comes
the ***payment***.

***Someone is going to have to pay for that sin.*** God is, if nothing
else, a *just* God. God is *infinitely* just. This means that someone
will pay for that sin.

But alongside God's justice is God's mercy and grace. He is at the same
time infinitely just and infinitely merciful and gracious. He made a way
for us to allow *someone else* to pay the penalty for *our* sin.

Jesus did not sin. His account is clean. He's the only person who ever
existed who did not sin. So that makes Him uniquely capable of doing
what seems impossible: **Jesus has the ability to pay for our sin.**

Jesus, on the cross, took our sin debt upon Himself. Past, present, and
future, the blood of Christ, shed for us, pays for our sin. Jesus
credits His righteousness from His sinless life to our account, He takes
our sin debt from us, and He pays for it with His own death. Only Jesus
could do this.

But because we have free will, we must *choose* to love Jesus. We must
*choose* to believe that He gave His life to save us. We must *accept*
that gift of life. This retains our free will: we must make the choice
to accept Christ as our savior. We can choose to reject this gift. God
allows us to make that choice. For those who reject Christ, **they
choose to pay for that sin themselves** in eternity. For the believer,
Christ's salvific work on the cross is credited to us, and He takes the
penalty for our sin.

C. S. Lewis said it best when he wrote, "There are only two kinds of
people in the end: those who say to God, 'Thy will be done,' and those
to whom God says, in the end, '*Thy* will be done.' All that are in
Hell, choose it. Without that self-choice there would be no Hell. No
soul that seriously and constantly desires joy will ever miss it. Those
who seek find. To those who knock it is opened." That door is being held
open by Jesus Christ.

So how do we do it? How can we "walk through that door?" Paul wrote, "If
you confess with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart
that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with
your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth
that you confess and are saved" (Romans 10:9).

Some will say, "I believe that Jesus died for my sins and rose from the
dead." And that's good but merely *believing* that Jesus died for your
sins and rose from the dead is **not enough.** You need to put your
*trust* in him. For example, you can believe that a certain person would
make a great spouse, but that's not enough to make that person your
spouse. You need to go *beyond* the belief, beyond the intellectual and
to the volitional: you must put your trust in that person by saying "I
do." The same is true concerning your relationship with God. Trusting
Him is not just a decision of the head, but of the heart. It is often
said that the distance between heaven and hell is about eighteen inches:
that's the distance between the head and the heart.
