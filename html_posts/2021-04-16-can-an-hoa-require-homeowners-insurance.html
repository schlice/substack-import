**Can an HOA require homeowners insurance?**

There is a major difference here between homeowner's associations (HOA)
and Condominium Associations.

In HOAs, [[Mark
Stinson](https://www.quora.com/profile/Mark-Stinson-15)]{.qlink_container}
is spot on with his answer. HOAs can only do what is listed for them to
do in their governing documents. If their bylaws say that they will
monitor all homes and ensure that they all carry some form of
homeowner's insurance, then they will do just that.

So can they? If it's in their governing documents, sure they can.

But routinely, they do not. HOAs have two primary missions: keeping home
values as high as possible by maintaining the look-and-feel of the
neighborhood, and managing community property (clubhouses, swimming
pools, playgrounds, etc). That's it. Everything they do can (or should)
be traced back to one of these missions.

And in general, homeowner's insurance is between you and your lender.
There is little benefit to the neighborhood to you having homeowner's
insurance other than timeliness of home replacement.

But for condos, it's a whole other ballgame. Condos are heavily impacted
if you don't have homeowner's insurance and damage happens within your
condo which causes damages to your neighbors. You will need to be able
to pay for that damage that you cause to other property, and the Condo
Association can require you carry homeowner's insurance on your condo.
