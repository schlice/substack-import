History and logic tells us that this will not happen.

In every other state where Constitutional Carry has been implemented,
killings have not increased. Remember, the people who were getting
permits in the first place are the people who were law-abiding already.
We simply now allow the law-abiding to not have to jump through the
hoops of getting a permit.

***At worst***, what may happen is that ***accidents*** may increase
because there are both more guns in public, and more opportunities for
negligent discharges to occur because of the larger density of firearms.

But this comes at the benefit of removing the financial barrier of
having to get a permit before being able to protect yourself with a
firearm. In other words, this Constitutionally-authorized protection is
now equally available to all people who would otherwise qualify, money
is no object. This means the poor are more able to carry a firearm for
protection; we're not adding another barrier for the poor to protect
themselves.
