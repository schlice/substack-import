First things first. I want you to take note of the box at the top of
this page, in which the text begins \"Need Help?\" You don\'t need to
read it now, and you said you don\'t want to hurt yourself, but you do
want to die. When you feel up to it, please go to that box and click the
\"(more)\" link. Call the appropriate number based on where in the world
you are. There are people you can talk to, any time, 24x7.

It also sounds like you may be suffering from some depression. After
you\'ve spoken to the folks at that resource, please talk to your doctor
about this. Your depression can be managed fairly easily, and you\'d be
surprised how it changes your outlook on life.
