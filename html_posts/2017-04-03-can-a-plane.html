First of all, the doors on modern airliners all open **inward,** they do
not open outward. Doesn't matter how hard you fall against it, you're
not going to open it.

Secondly, the cabin is **pressurized**. This means that the door is
being pressed into its frame by the differential air pressure inside the
cabin. At a typical cruising altitude, you can have up to 8 pounds per
square inch (psi) of pressure on the interior of the fuselage. That's
over 1,100 pounds per square foot holding that door into its door frame.
A human physically cannot move a door with around 2 psi (common at lower
altitudes) pushing it closed, let alone the 8 psi at cruising altitude.
You simply cannot physically move the door with that much air pressure
against it. The doors are further held in place by a series of
electrical and/or mechanical latches which prevent it from opening
unless you actually intend on opening it (which again is impossible
while in flight).

Thirdly, on the actual 2002 flight from hell, Lesnar and Henning fell
into the door. The "almost opening it" part that seems to be part of
some of the accounts all appears to be embellishment.

Short of some sort of massive structural failure, you cannot open an
emergency exit mid-flight.
