Free will is crucial to God's plan for our salvation.

Human beings absolutely have free will, which means that we are able to
make choices which genuinely affect our destiny. The current fallen,
sinful state of the world is directly related to free choices made by
Adam and Eve, so we know that free will exists and God gave it to us.

Free will does not, however, mean that we can do *anything.* It means
that we can do anything which we are able to do; we can only do the
things in keeping with our nature. For example, I can choose to walk
across a bridge, or skip across a bridge, or run across a bridge. But I
cannot choose to *fly* across a bridge. My nature as a creature with no
wings means I cannot fly. In the same way, man cannot choose to make
himself righteous. Bottom line: free will is limited by nature.

That said, this limitation does not mitigate our accountability. We have
the *ability* to choose, but we have the *responsibility* to choose
wisely. In the Bible, Jesus says that the only way to salvation is to
"repent" and "believe." Taking those two actions is a *choice*. You
freely choose to repent and believe.

God loves you and He desperately wants you to be with Him. But He will
only interact with people who freely choose to love Him. That's where
the free will comes into play. He will forever seek you, but you need to
choose Him.
