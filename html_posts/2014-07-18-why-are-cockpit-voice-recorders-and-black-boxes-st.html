**Content:** [The answer is easy: money.\
\
The airline industry is one of the penny-pinchingest industries out
there, with profit margins hovering just around 1%. This low margin is
primarily due to government regulations and the cost of jet fuel.
Anything that increases cost is very closely scrutinized. The Economist
magazine reported that airlines made a profit of \$4 per passenger in
2012.\
\
The cost in streaming black box data over satellite is the satellite
transmission cost, which based on the amount of data recorded by the
black box, would run roughly \$5 to \$7 per minute to transmit the data
for a flight over the Iridium satellite data network. So a typical 2
hour flight would cost \$840 for data transmission. Divide that up over
the 335 passengers that can be carried in an Airbus A330 and your profit
margin of \$4 per passenger is now reduced by \$2.50, leaving the
airline making \$1.50 per passenger, a number which is unacceptable to
the airlines.]{.rendered_qtext}
