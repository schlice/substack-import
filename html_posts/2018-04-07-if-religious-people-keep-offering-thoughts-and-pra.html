**If religious people keep offering thoughts and prayers after school
shootings, will the continuation of school shootings eventually lead
them to believe there is no god?**

So it sounds to me like you're asking whether or not unanswered prayers
means there is no God.

When you were a kid, and you asked your parents for that one piece of
candy that you really really wanted, and you didn't get it, did you tell
yourself that there are no parents?

Or did you instead come to the realization that parents are not a
vending machine? You can't put in a good word and get out a piece of
candy. From your parents, you get what you need, when you need it, and
you don't get what you don't need. And they don't always tell you why.
Sometimes, they just give you what you need, when you need it, and don't
give you things you don't need, without explanation.

Do you feel like God is a vending machine? Do you pray to him, and when
you don't get what you want, do you feel like the vending machine is
broken? Or that it doesn't exist at all?

Isn't it possible that God, instead of simply "not giving you what you
want," has told you **no**?

*But why would He want school shootings to continue? That doesn't make
sense!*

In truth, it doesn't make sense *to us.*

> "For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my
> ways," declares the Lord. "As the heavens are higher than the earth,
> so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your
> thoughts" (Isaiah 55:8--9).

Do you think you're smart enough to understand God's plan in all of
this? I know I'm certainly not, and not because I'm not a smart person,
but because I'm a *person*. God's thoughts are so far above mine that I
simply wouldn't be able to comprehend why He is doing what He is. And I
know that there is a plan in what he's doing. "'For I know the plans I
have for you,' declares the Lord, 'plans to prosper you and not to harm
you, plans to give you hope and a future.'" (Jeremiah 29:11).

He has a plan, even though He chooses not to tell us. Solomon wrote in
Proverbs 25:2, "It is the glory of God to conceal a matter..." Isaiah
45:15 says, "Truly, you are a God who hides himself." Ecclesiastes 11:5
proclaims, "As you do not know the path of the wind, or how the body is
formed in a mother's womb, so you cannot understand the work of God, the
Maker of all things."

To be fair, it's not my place to understand, either. I let God handle
God's business, while I handle mine. I don't look at God and say, "Why
aren't you doing what ***I*** want?" How impetuous of us if we think
like this!

In fact, I'm certain that God is very sad when he sees a school
shooting. But I do know that everything He allows to happen is part of
His plan. And don't think for a second that He didn't allow this stuff
to happen. So therefore, it must be part of His plan.

Where did you get this idea that God would "skip along in front of us
with His great cosmic broom, sweeping aside each trial and every
troubling uncertainty? To the contrary, Jesus told His disciples that
they should anticipate suffering. He said, "I have told you these
things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have
trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world" (John 16:33)."

Where did this idea come from that if God isn't acting the way we expect
Him to, that we can safely ignore Him? It's almost blasphemous to think
such a thing!

Dr. Dobson goes on to say, "My concern is that many believers apparently
feel God owes them smooth sailing or at least a full explanation (and
perhaps an apology) for the hardships they encounter. We must never
forget that He, after all, is God. He is majestic and holy and
sovereign. He is accountable to no one. He is not an errand boy who
chases the assignments we dole out. He is not a genie who pops out of
the bottle to satisfy our whims. He is not our servant---we are His."

So instead of praying for fewer trials, perhaps we should pray to be
stronger in the face of them, knowing that He has a plan for us, and
while we may not understand it, we know He keeps his promises.
