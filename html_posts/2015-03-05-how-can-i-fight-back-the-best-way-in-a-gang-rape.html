**Content:** [Keep fighting, never give up. Bite, kick, scream, spit,
pee (well, that one may not work entirely; people have odd fetishes) but
whatever you do, keep fighting. I like [[Jack
Elphinstone](https://www.quora.com/profile/Jack-Elphinstone)]{.qlink_container}\'s
suggestion of attacking the ringleader, but ultimately just keep
fighting; make it unpleasant for them to do what they are desiring to
do.\
\
Remember, it only takes seven pounds of pressure to remove the outer ear
from the head; rip it off from the top down really hard like you\'re
ripping a paper towel sheet off of the roll. Imagine what it would feel
like if you handed someone his ear. With a thumb appropriately
positioned at the inner corner of the eye, press in like you are digging
for the brain. Then bend your thumb. The eye will pop out and hang there
off the optic nerve. Tends to make people focus less on gang rape and
more on the fact that one of their eyes has popped out of its socket.\

But whatever you do, never stop saying no, and never stop
fighting]{.rendered_qtext}
