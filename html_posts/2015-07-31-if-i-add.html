**Content:** [It is not illegal to ask where you can buy illegal drugs.
This is not considered solicitation, because there is no intent to
participate in the sale and/or purchase of illegal drugs. For example,
you could be doing research on where illegal drugs are sold in a
particular city.\
\
It may be illegal to walk up to a drug dealer and tell him you want to
buy drugs. \"Solicitation\" of a crime involves verbal indication that
you want to commit a crime and intent to participate in the commission
of that crime. You don\'t actually have to buy the drugs in order to be
convicted of the crime of solicitation.\
\
It is definitely illegal to actually hand over the money in exchange for
drugs.]{.rendered_qtext}
