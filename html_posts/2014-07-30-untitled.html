<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [I won\'t argue that it is *unlikely,* if not *extremely<br>unlikely*, that such a situation would come to pass. But the longer we<br>can keep a driver in his/her seat, the more the possibility arises that<br>the driver could potentially regain control of that vehicle.\<br>\<br>What about the equivalent of a PIT? The car would still be operable, but<br>the driver could be bounced out of his seat.\<br>\<br>Anyway, I agree that it\'s really unlikely, but it is possible. I think<br>that arguing that it is really unlikely that such an accident scenario<br>could actually happen is not a good argument for repealing laws<br>requiring driver safety restraints. You stand a better chance limiting<br>the seat belt requirement to speeds over 50 miles per hour, where you<br>can show that at those speeds, such an accident is likely to result in<br>deaths whereas below those speeds, you\'re more likely that the seat<br>belt will injure the person rather than save them.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Arent-laws-like-making-seat-belts-mandatory-violating-peoples-right-to-freedom/answer/Chris-Bast<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
