<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [I won\'t argue that it is *unlikely,* if not *extremely
unlikely*, that such a situation would come to pass. But the longer we
can keep a driver in his/her seat, the more the possibility arises that
the driver could potentially regain control of that vehicle.\
\
What about the equivalent of a PIT? The car would still be operable, but
the driver could be bounced out of his seat.\
\
Anyway, I agree that it\'s really unlikely, but it is possible. I think
that arguing that it is really unlikely that such an accident scenario
could actually happen is not a good argument for repealing laws
requiring driver safety restraints. You stand a better chance limiting
the seat belt requirement to speeds over 50 miles per hour, where you
can show that at those speeds, such an accident is likely to result in
deaths whereas below those speeds, you\'re more likely that the seat
belt will injure the person rather than save them.]{.rendered_qtext}
