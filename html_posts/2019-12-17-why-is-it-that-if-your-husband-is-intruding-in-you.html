**Why is it that if your husband is intruding in your bed, you can not
file charges, but if your husband is intruding in your email, then you
can file charges?**

Your husband has a legal right to "intrude in your bed" since he lives
there with you and it is common knowledge that married couples share a
bed. Unless he's actually doing something illegal, like trying to rape
you, then he's allowed to be in your bed. You can ask him to go sleep
somewhere else, but it's not illegal for him to sleep in the same bed as
you, since you are married and you share a house.

Federal law says that mail can only be opened by the addressee unless
prior permission was granted.

So why? Because one is illegal and the other isn't.
