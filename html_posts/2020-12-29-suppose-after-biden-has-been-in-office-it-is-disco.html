**Suppose after Biden has been in office, it is discovered there was
massive voter fraud, what happens next? Is Biden impeached?**

Seems most folks are not answering the question.

Unless Biden was personally involved with the voter fraud which got him
into office, he would not be impeached. Impeachment is for high crimes
and misdemeanors. Unless Biden committed those crimes, impeachment would
not be a remedy.

If it was discovered that there was massive voter fraud, the first
questions would go to the states where that fraud was discovered. "You
certified your election results. How did you miss this massive voter
fraud?" Many years will be spent sorting out how the states allowed this
massive voter fraud to go undetected. I bet you'd also see some
complicit election officials going to jail as well. States will have to
show that they are rooting out the sources of the fraud. New laws will
be written, and my guess is that most of the laws will center around
mail-in voting. If there was massive voter fraud, the most likely vector
for such fraud would be mail-in voting. New security procedures will be
implemented, and (I suspect) most states will never do a massive mail-in
voting election like was done this year.

(EDIT) As of today (June, 2021), several states have passed laws
preventing exactly the kinds of vectors that opened the door to the
voter fraud we saw during Biden's election. Note that we haven't been
able to prove that there was *enough* voter fraud to sway the outcome,
but that doesn't change the fact that these liberal policies regarding
mail-in voting made it easier to effect this level of fraud. (/EDIT)

There may even be Federal rules for states that wish to participate in
federal elections. States which did not check signatures, states which
did not follow standard counting procedures, states which sent
unsolicited ballots to massive amounts of people on their voter rolls,
including dead people, etc., will all be highly scrutinized for the next
few years until voting is revamped. Remember Florida's 2000 voting
debacle during the Bush v. Gore election? Two words: hanging chads.
Well, Florida got a huge black eye over that, and they spent the next
few years cleaning up their voting systems. 2020 may not have been
perfect, but Florida was on top of it. Their election ran very smoothly.

Since the states certified their results in accordance with the
Constitution, the results would be allowed to stand, but the Biden
presidency would be marred by scandal, knowing that it's likely
(although never proven) that he was not the people's choice. He won't be
the only president ever accused of being seated under fraudulent
conditions, but he would be the latest.
