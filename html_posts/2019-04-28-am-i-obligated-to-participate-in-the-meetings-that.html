**Am I obligated to participate in the meetings that my HOA conducts to
discuss issues in the subdivision?**

As a homeowner, you have the ability to attend any monthly HOA board
meeting of your choice. The HOA also holds annual meetings, as required
by law. I would highly suggest that you attend, at the very least, the
annual meeting. The board will discuss how the year went, and plans for
the upcoming years

It\'s probably not necessary that you attend each and every monthly
meeting as a homeowner, unless you have a specific concern that you want
the board to address.

Also, bear in mind that the board can go into executive session at the
monthly meeting, as required to protect individual homeowner
confidentiality. You cannot attend an executive session. Executive
sessions are governed by state law; some states do not allow executive
session for anything other than attorneys' meetings, or personnel
issues.
