The Presidential Records Act, in a nutshell, establishes that all
presidential records are owned by the public, and then it defines what
"presidential records" are.

Then the Act goes into painstaking detail regarding how records *should
be* handled during the president's administration, and what should
happen to records after a president leaves office.

Importantly, the Act establishes that presidential records automatically
transfer into the legal custody of the Archivist (at the National
Archives) once the president leaves office.

However, if the president's staff *did not* do a good job keeping
presidential records and personal records separate while the president
was the incumbent (and since the Act has been established, none have
done so), the default process is for the departing president to retain
all of the records, and then a review process happens between the
Archivist and the president's staff to determine which records are
presidential records and which are personal records. The presidential
records are delivered to the Archivist for filing at the National
Archives, and the president retains his personal records, some of which
may end up in the presidential library, when it gets established.
