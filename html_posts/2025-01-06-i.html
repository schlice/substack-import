The *illegal* part.

Legal immigration is great. We love it! More people should immigrate to
the United States.

**Illegal** immigration is terrible. If your first act after entering
the new country you intend to live in is to break its laws, you're not
really doing anyone any favors.

Now, that's not to say that our legal immigration system is perfect; it
is not. We have a lot of work to do to improve our immigration system.
How we vet new immigrants, and the amounts we allow to naturalize, is
insanely poor. We have a lot of work to do to untie the red tape
surrounding our immigration and naturalization system. It is very, very
broken, **but not beyond fixing.**

**HOWEVER**, just because our immigration system is broken ***is not an
excuse to break the law to become a citizen.*** Plenty of people still
immigrate to this country legally every year. They legally become US
citizens. I've seen it. If you've never been to a swearing-in ceremony,
then it's probably because you didn't know someone who was naturalizing.
But I've seen it and it is beautiful. We as a country absolutely want
that.

What we **DON'T** want is people "jumping the line" and thinking that
they will be accepted. Nope, deported back to your country. Get in line
with everyone else.
