**Content:** [In operation, very little. The difference is in the
*jurisdiction.*\
\
A state can have its own police force. Generally, the law enforcement
organizations at the state level are called \"State Police\" and their
officers are called \"Troopers.\" The State Police is divided into
\"Troops\" for ease of functioning across such a
geographically-dispersed region as a state.\
\
States in the United States are further divided into \"counties\" for
administrative and other purposes. There are 3,144 counties and county
equivalents in the United States. For the most part (the Northeast being
the notable exception), counties have a Sheriff responsible for law
enforcement throughout the county. Sheriffs will \"deputize\" law
enforcement officers to carry out the law enforcement within the county.
They are called \"Sheriff\'s Deputies\" or just \"Deputy\" for short.\
\
Incorporated cities within a county are separately-functioning
government entities. They can collect taxes and perform all normal
governmental functions. Accordingly, cities can have their own police
departments. These departments are called \"Police Departments\" and
their officers are called \"Police Officers\" or just \"Officer\" for
short.\
\
In total, counting all state, city and county law enforcement, there are
over 18,000 separate law enforcement agencies within the United States.\
\
In general, the organization with more broad jurisdiction will defer
actions within a smaller jurisdiction to that smaller department, even
though both organizations have \"concurrent jurisdiction\" within that
area.]{.rendered_qtext}
