- Swipe down from the top of the screen and select the gear icon, this
  will take you into Settings.
- Select **Applications**
- Select **Application Manager**
- Click **MORE** in the upper-right hand portion of the screen.
- Select "Apps that can appear on top"
- De-select any apps that you no longer wish to allow permission to draw
  over other apps.

If you're having a specific problem with the Install button, for
example, there is a great (ad-supported) app called [[Install Button
Unlocker](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=95e599&url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id%3Djp.sfapps.installbuttonunlocker){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="google.com"}]{.qlink_container} by SFApps. You can find it
in the Google Play Store. It is extremely effective at identifying and
allowing access to these pesky buttons which always seem to be
underneath a "screen overlay." You do have to contend with ads, but it's
a small price to pay to fix the annoying screen overlay issue.
