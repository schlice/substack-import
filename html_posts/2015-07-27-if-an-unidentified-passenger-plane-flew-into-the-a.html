**Content:** [The entity charged with watching the ADIZ (Air Defense
Identification Zone) is NORAD, the North American Aerospace Defense
Command, which is a ***combined*** command. A combined command differs
from a ***joint*** command as a joint command is inter-service, where a
combined command is international. NORAD is a combined US-Canadian
command comprised of military members from both countries.\
\
The ADIZ varies in the distance of its boundaries, but in general is
about 200 nautical miles off the coast of the United States.\

\
Any aircraft that crosses the ADIZ must have a valid flight plan filed
with the FAA. This includes aircraft that are continuing internationally
(i.e. not landing in the United States). An aircraft that does not have
a valid flight plan as it crosses the ADIZ ***into*** North American
airspace will be flagged, and NORAD fighter assets will be deployed to
intercept. NORAD has a fighter base dedicated to each ADIZ where pilots
sit \"alert\" waiting to dash out to an airframe and intercept an
incoming aircraft.\
\
The interceptors would visually identify and attempt to contact the
inbound aircraft using radio as well as \"shots across the bow,\" where
the fighter will cross the flight path of the intruder at a visually
close range. An F-16 screaming past the nose of your aircraft is hard to
ignore. At the same time, NORAD and FAA ground controllers will attempt
to contact the company or governmental agency that owns the aircraft,
based on registration or markings. Once they exhaust all attempts to
contact the aircraft, and they are certain that the aircraft is
intentionally non-compliant, the NCA (National Command Authority) will
make a determination on what to do. There are many things they can do,
such as escorting the aircraft, ensuring it does not endanger US
citizens by its actions, attempting to force it to land somewhere, or if
the NCA deems the aircraft to be a threat (especially if the aircraft is
not a commercial airliner), they do have the authority to shoot it
down.\
\
(EDIT) To answer the updated portion of the question:\
\
*If the plane ignored even signals from jet fighters and flew into
heavily populated areas and started releasing unidentified material. I
imagine orders to shoot wouldn\'t come quickly even in the aftermath of
9/11.*\
\
As I mentioned above, there are lots of factors that will determine how
the military responds to an intruder.\

- Is the aircraft a commercial jet liner with passengers aboard, visible
  from the windows? Is it a military aircraft? Is it a private cargo
  plane?
- Is the registration up to date? Can the owner be contacted?
- Is the pilot visible in the cockpit? Is he/she responding to visual
  signals?

On top of this, the pilots are authorized to shoot the aircraft out of
the sky if they see an immediate security threat. First of all, an
aircraft coming in from overseas or from another country, crossing the
ADIZ, without a flight plan, would not make it very far past US
territorial airspace (which is inside of the ADIZ).\
\
Even if it did, the pilots would prevent it from overflying a populated
area using whatever means they deemed to be necessary. It would never
get to a point where it could release something over a populated area.
It could absolutely do so with a flight plan, but without one, it would
be unlikely to be able to get close.
