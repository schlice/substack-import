**Would it makes sense to file amicus briefs to petition various courts
to declare Donald Trump a vexatious litigant?**

A vexatious litigant is one who files frequent frivolous lawsuits. A
frivolous lawsuit is one which has little to no evidence to support its
filing.

*There is no evidence to support the claim that Trump contesting
selected state elections is vexatious.*

In fact, there are hundreds of sworn depositions which support their
claim. Remember, *evidence* is different than *proof*. While *evidence*
exists in sufficient quantity to justify the claim, *proof* may be
fleeting, but that follows legal investigation. There is more than
enough evidence to prove that these suits are not frivolous.

You may believe that his lawsuits will ultimately not change the result
of the elections. It's true, they may not. ***But that does not negate
his right to file them, nor does that lead their filing to be
vexatious***. In fact, I would say that if he has evidence that voter
fraud has taken place in a state, he has a *duty* to pursue the case,
for the sake of the integrity of the election process.

Compare Trump's lawsuits with some other notable vexatious litigants:

> - **Leo Stoller**, a trademark troll, was declared a vexatious

>   Court, in 2007.[\[1\]](#KfNsj){#cite-KfNsj .citation_link}

I'm reasonably sure Trump's lawsuits do not rise to the level of
vexatious litigation.

*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.
Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a
civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not
misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously, and I have no tolerance
for harassing or inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough
shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion
masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your
own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site.
If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\"
don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything
vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be followed by a
block/mute, and a BNBR report. I will do this immediately and with no
compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*
