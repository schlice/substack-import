**Can legitimately purchased mp3 licenses be sold or otherwise
transferred to somebody else?**

It used to be that you could re-sell your CDs and records legally. This
was called the *first sale* doctrine. Otherwise, donating your CDs or
records, or selling them at a garage sale, would be illegal. The first
sale doctrine says that you have the right to "sell or otherwise
dispose" of your media without seeking the permission of the copyright
owner.

But what about digital media?

The courts have said that the first sale doctrine does not apply to
digital media.

When you sell your hard media, there is still only one copy of that
media. When you sell your digital media, a flawless perfect duplicate
copy is created on the purchaser's computer. That copy, said the courts,
is an unauthorized reproduction. Traditional media had an inbuilt
limiting factor slowing down reproductions: copies degrade with each
passing copy. However, digital copies do not suffer from this
limitation: each copy is an exact duplicate, which retains 100% of its
quality.

There is an opportunity for digital retailers and content creators to
create a marketplace for reselling copies of music, and Amazon and
Google are working towards that. But today, no such technology exists.

So for now, reselling digital licenses and transferring the media to
someone else is illegal.
