The last time I tried to talk about abortion on this very platform, I
was told, in no uncertain terms, that my opinion didn't matter "because
I was unable to have an abortion or carry a child to term."

Therefore, employing the same Quora logic, Caitlyn Jenner's opinion also
doesn't matter, for exactly the same reason.

Interesting. When it comes to everything else, a woman can be whatever
you want it to be, but when it comes to abortion, Caitlyn Jenner isn't a
real woman. So either we know exactly what a real woman is, or we don't.
