The atheist, upon taking the stand, need only advise the judge that they
do not wish to swear. Witnesses are permitted to *affirm* rather than
swear. A typical affirmation used in U.S. District Courts would sound
like this:

> You do affirm that all the testimony you are about to give in the case
> now before the court will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing
> but the truth; this you do affirm under the pains and penalties of
> perjury?

Raising the right hand is not swearing, it actually is a practice which
goes back hundreds of years. Back in early England, criminals would get
their hands branded following a conviction. Thus, when in court, they
raise the right hand to prove that they have no brand; if they did, the
court would not be so lenient with the person.
