Wikipedia is very illuminating on this one:

> The settlement a person receives for their pain and suffering depends
> on many factors. This includes the severity of the injury, type of
> medical treatment received, the length of recovery time, and potential
> long term consequences of the personal injuries. In addition to
> physical pain, claimants can also cite emotional and psychological
> trauma in their pain and suffering claims. For example, a visible scar
> on the face can lead to painful feelings of constant embarrassment and
> insecurity.
>
> The amount of money damages a claimant gets for pain and suffering
> will also depend upon the amount claimed in a lawsuit if such is filed
> or the amount demanded to the responsible party in the underlying
> claim if it is an insurance claim. Even though a lawyer representing a
> client in an injury negligence-based lawsuit may claim a certain
> amount for pain and suffering, the jury or the insurance adjuster will
> award pain and suffering money for differing reasons. In practice,
> historically tort cases involving personal injury often involve
> contingent fees, with attorneys being paid a portion of the pain and
> suffering damages; one commentator says a typical split of pain and
> suffering is one-third for the lawyer, one-third for the physician,
> and one-third for the plaintiff.
>
> Jury awards for pain and suffering may vary depending upon
> socio-economic and political factors within the community from which
> the jury is drawn. In most states the maximum monetary amount awarded
> for pain and suffering is capped at what is listed in the particular
> suit or written complaint. In some jurisdictions there are maximum
> amounts set in law which a jury may not exceed in awarding damages.
>
> The personality of the plaintiff, their witnesses and overall effect
> of the injuries which befell the victim plaintiff will play a powerful
> role in any damage award if damages are even awarded once liability
> issues are satisfied. The power and personality of the lawyer
> representing her or his client also may factor into a high money
> damage award case.
>
> Such awards may follow in house insurance guidelines with some leeway
> granted to adjusters to adjust the claim in order to prevent the claim
> from being fully litigated in court. There is a wide range of levels
> of compensation which may fluctuate seasonally and with the economy
> and dictates of the insurance industry setting the varying levels of
> compensation to claimants. Some insurers have experimented with using
> computers which tabulate the data that is presented and grant the
> adjuster a level of money authority for which to settle the
> claim.[\[1\]](#wWzwP){#cite-wWzwP .citation_link}
