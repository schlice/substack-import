The police must have a warrant to search your car. Otherwise, the
general rule is that an officer must have at least an objectively
reasonable basis for suspecting criminal activity is afoot before
conducting a warrantless search. This is called *probable cause.* The
reason is because the 4th Amendment says that the government is not
permitted to conduct ***unreasonable*** searches of your person or
property. Probable cause makes the search *reasonable*.

There are a very few exceptions to the requirements of the 4th
Amendment, under which the police can search your vehicle without a
warrant. Here's a few:

- Search incident to an arrest. If you've been arrested, the police can
  search the area in and around you without a warrant. This generally
  means your car.
- Exigent circumstances. If the police hear noise coming from your
  trunk, they can presume that someone in there needs help, and can
  search your car.
- The plain sight exception. If the police see illegal items in your car
  without moving or touching anything, this is called "plain sight."
  - The corollary to this is the "plain smell" exception. If the police
    smell weed, for example, outside of your car, this is usually enough
    to permit them warrantless access to search your car.\
    \
    This, however, is changing, as marijuana laws are relaxed around the
    country. In places where marijuana is legal, the smell of marijuana
    alone may not be enough to permit a warrantless search of your
    vehicle.
  - Additionally, the police can still use a K-9 to search the exterior
    of your vehicle. However, the police cannot detain you beyond the
    natural conclusion of the traffic stop in order to wait for a K-9 to
    arrive. This means that the police cannot unnaturally alter the
    length of the stop to wait for a K-9, nor can they extend the end of
    the stop to do so, either.
