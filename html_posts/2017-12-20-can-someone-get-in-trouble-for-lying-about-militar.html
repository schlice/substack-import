**Can someone get in trouble for lying about military service?**

As with all things legal, the answer is "it depends." What it depends on
is *whether or not you get financial gain from your lie.*

- **If you do**, this is a crime. At the state level, this is called
  **theft of service**. At the Federal level, this is prohibited under
  the **Stolen Valor Act**.
- **If you do not**, then it is technically not illegal to lie about
  being a military veteran, or being active duty, or being a retiree.
  It's protected by the 1st Amendment, and case law has held the same
  thing. There are Federal laws which prohibit non-military personnel
  from wearing military uniforms, but they are largely unenforceable
  because of 1A protections.
