DeSantis.

Not because Trump's policies are bad. Every one of his policies are
proving that he was right.

The problem with Trump is Trump himself, not his policies. Trump is just
too polarizing a figure to be an effective leader.

DeSantis has a much sharper media team. He engages on social media when
it is beneficial. He doesn't tweet like Trump did. He is very
intelligent, but is measured with his responses.

Basically, he espouses all of Trump's policies without the baggage of
Trump.
