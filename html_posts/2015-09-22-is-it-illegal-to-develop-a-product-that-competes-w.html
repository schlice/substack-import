**Content:** [Most of the time, if you work on a project on company
time, using company property, the project belongs to the company. Most
employment agreements state that what you develop on company time is the
intellectual property of the company, not you.\
\
If you want to develop something that competes with your own company,
you will need to do it on your own time, using your own property.\
\
Also, you may have a non-compete clause that forbids you from competing
with the company, since working at the comany, you have inside knowledge
about how the company makes the product, which would give you an unfair
market advantage.\
\
Basically, the company wants you using your talents to improve their
product, not going out and trying to undercut them. So they\'re going to
contractually protect that.\
\
If you\'re really interested in doing this, you should have your
employment agreement and any non-compete clauses you signed reviewed by
an attorney who specializes in employment law.]{.rendered_qtext}
