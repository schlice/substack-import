**Content:** [There is a very big difference between criminal defendants
and terrorist combatants. The main difference: the scope of the
potential outcome. In the Darren Wilson example you pointed out, the
difference is whether or not one man goes to prison. No additional lives
would potentially be saved through his torture. In the terrorist
example, the difference is hundreds of thousands of lives saved through
the prevention of another terrorist attack. Therefore, there is a very
bright line and a very clear precedent in using torture techniques
against only the most hardened terrorists, and only in situations where
many lives are at stake.]{.rendered_qtext}
