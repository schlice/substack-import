<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [There is a very big difference between criminal defendants<br>and terrorist combatants. The main difference: the scope of the<br>potential outcome. In the Darren Wilson example you pointed out, the<br>difference is whether or not one man goes to prison. No additional lives<br>would potentially be saved through his torture. In the terrorist<br>example, the difference is hundreds of thousands of lives saved through<br>the prevention of another terrorist attack. Therefore, there is a very<br>bright line and a very clear precedent in using torture techniques<br>against only the most hardened terrorists, and only in situations where<br>many lives are at stake.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
