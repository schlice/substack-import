As with any legal question, the answer is "it depends."

The law in NC prohibits HOAs from banning solar panels outright. **It
does, however, allow HOAs to control the** ***placement*** **of solar
panels.**

The relevant NC law, updated in 2007:

> Article 8 of Chapter 160A of the General Statutes is amended by adding
> a new section to read:
>
> \"*§ 160A-201. Limitations on regulating solar collectors.*
>
> *(a)* *Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, no city
> ordinance shall prohibit, or have the effect of prohibiting, the
> installation of a solar collector that gathers solar radiation as a
> substitute for traditional energy for water heating, active space
> heating and cooling, passive heating, or generating electricity for a
> detached single-family residence, and no person shall be denied
> permission by a city to install a solar collector that gathers solar
> radiation as a substitute for traditional energy for water heating,
> active space heating and cooling, passive heating, or generating
> electricity for a detached single-family residence.*
>
> *(b)* *This section does not prohibit an ordinance regulating the
> location or screening of solar collectors as described in subsection
> (a) of this section, provided the ordinance does not have the effect
> of preventing the reasonable use of a solar collector for a detached

>

>

So the law is clear: a homeowner's association may not **prevent** you
from installing solar. However, the local government or your HOA can
regulate the **location** of those solar panels.

You will have to check your Governing Documents for your HOA to
determine whether or not they regulate the location of your solar
panels. The law in NC says they *can*. It's up to you to get in to the
Governing Documents to find out if they *do*.
