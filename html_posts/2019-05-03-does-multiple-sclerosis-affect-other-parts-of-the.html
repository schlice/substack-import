**Does multiple sclerosis affect other parts of the body besides the
nerves?**

Since you called out the nerves, I'll assume you meant that you want to
know whether or not the MS disease process involves any other parts of
the body besides the Central Nervous System.

The answer is no, MS only affects the nerves of the CNS. The MS disease
process does not impact any other physical part of the body.

The ***result*** of that demyelination of nerves within the CNS can be
seen throughout the body, but the actual demyelination process only
affects the nerve cells of the CNS.
