Do you remember the \"Assault Weapons\" ban from the *last* Clinton
presidency? Was that an infringement on any 2nd Amendment rights?
Congress seemed to think so, as they thought enough of the ban to allow
it to expire without renewing it.

Clinton also wants to repeal the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms
Act so that victims of gun violence can attempt to file lawsuits against
gun manufacturers because their guns killed someone. It is unprecedented
to file a lawsuit against a product manufacturer when their product
works as designed, but you don\'t like what it does. You don\'t see
people suing Ford when a drunk driver kills someone. You don\'t hear
calls for Ford to build a \"safer\" car.

Clinton claims that PLCAA gives \"blanket immunity\" to gun
manufacturers, failing to force them to make their products \"safer.\"
First of all, safer for whom? Guns are designed to kill. If a gun is
used to kill someone, it is working as designed. If the operator of the
gun is uninjured after using it, it is working safely. It\'s not the
gun\'s fault that someone died. It\'s not the gun manufacturer\'s fault
that someone died, either. There are copious warnings about what a gun
does printed all over the box, sometimes right on the gun itself.
Frankly, I find it hard to imagine that someone holding a gun doesn\'t
know what it does. \"Wait, I though this was a blender! I never wanted
to kill anyone!\" Yeah, not likely.

Secondly, if a gun is indeed unsafe to use, you can sue the manufacturer
under PLCAA. The law does not protect manufacturers from suits when
their product **does not** work as designed. If, instead of killing the
target in front of it, it injures the operator, the manufacturer can
definitely face liability for that. The law simply protects
manufacturers from frivolous lawsuits attempting to transfer liability
from the operator to the manufacturer. In fact, other companies are
provided equal, if not greater, protection against liability in the
United States. [[PolitiFact already rated Clinton\'s statements

She wants to close the \"gun show loophole,\" which we already know
doesn\'t exist. It is true that some people can buy guns without a
background check, but they don\'t do it at a gun show. In many states,
private sellers (such as someone selling a gun from a collection to a
friend or relative) do not need to obtain background checks first. Some
states have already instituted laws requiring all firearms transactions
to first have a background check performed by a dealer with a Federal
Firearms License. Clinton would seek to make it a Federal requirement
that any transfer of firearms between any two people would require a
background check. So if I wanted to gift a firearm to my son, he would
need a background check before I could legally do it.

She also wants to close the \"Charleston loophole\" which states that
the government has three days to complete its background check on
someone when buying a gun. The shooter in the Charleston church
shootings, Dylan Roof, was able to buy a gun when the background
investigation period expired. This was caused by a clerical error when
the FBI requested information from the wrong agency. Had they requested
information from the correct agency, they would have discovered that
Roof was arrested on a drug charge a month before he tried to purchase a
gun. Because the records didn\'t show a conviction, the investigator
could not stop the purchase, but they kept investigating anyway. Because
his records showed the wrong agency as the one who placed the arrest,
the FBI was unable to find the information in time, and the purchase
defaulted to proceed.

What is in question is not necessarily what happened in Roof\'s case \--
he likely wouldn\'t have been prevented from buying a gun even if the
correct agency was listed, because while he was arrested on a drug
charge, he was never convicted, so he was not a \"convicted felon\" who
is in an exempted class from purchasing firearms \-- but the three day
\"default to proceed\" legislation in the background check process.
Clinton seeks to change that, either to elongate the time before a
purchase can proceed, perhaps up to ten days, or perhaps change the law
from \"default to proceed\" to \"default to deny,\" meaning that if a
background check fails because of clerical issues, the sale cannot go
through. In the vast majority of cases, the instant background check
process works correctly. In my last gun purchase, it took less than five
minutes to return a \"proceed.\" Granted, the Federal government has *a
lot* of background information on me, as I have held a DoD Top Secret
security clearance for the better part of 20 years. They probably know
more about me than I do. Nevertheless, it\'s not likely that any change
to the background check system will do anything more than to
inconvenience legitimate buyers; you don\'t see a lot of criminals
purchasing guns just because the background check system failed to
produce results in the requisite three days. And criminals aren\'t
relying on the background check system failing in order to get a gun \--
they make their purchases from places which don\'t provide background
checks, otherwise known as the *black market*. The tightening of these
so-called \"loopholes\" will really have a negligent impact on crime,
but a very big impact on legitimate purchasers, but will have the
biggest impact on dealers.

The point here is that the Second Amendment was put in place to
safeguard these rights against exactly this kind of Federal overreach.
While a Clinton presidency would not pose a serious threat of anything
meaningful happening to the Second Amendment (you still need a
Constitutional Amendment to change it, or an Article V convention),
these laws are a slow but continuous *erosion* of our rights. If you
can\'t change the Constitution wholesale, you chip away at it piece by
piece, until eventually you have legislated those rights, legally, into
oblivion.
