**Content:** [The quality of healthcare in the United States has never
been an issue. We have some of the best healthcare in the world here.\
\
There are other factors of healthcare that are political issues, and the
biggest, baddest, elephant-in-the-room issue is how to **pay** for
healthcare.\
\
As any sentient being knows, healthcare is not free. Nor should it be.
Doctors train for years to become specialists in their fields of study,
and deserve to make money for their work. *Someone* has to pay them. The
question then becomes *who* should pay them.\
]{.rendered_qtext}

- Should governments pay them? Governments don\'t make money; they
  redistribute tax dollars taken from their citizens. So the extent to
  which government can pay for healthcare is directly tied to the amount
  of money they take in tax dollars from citizens. Canada has
  government-funded healthcare, but they also have very high taxes.

- Should insurance companies pay them? Perhaps there should be insurance
  involved, but to what extent? Today, insurance pays 100% of your
  doctor\'s fees, which makes the cost of care a negotiation between the
  insurance company and the doctor. The insurance company then
  negotiates with your employer to determine what that coverage will
  cost you. You, as a payer, are mostly out of the loop (see the next
  bullet).
- Should individuals pay them? Currently, individuals pay a \"copay\" or
  \"co-insurance\" so that individuals have some \"skin-in-the-game,\"
  so to speak, so that they don\'t use healthcare services willy-nilly
  and waste the insurance company\'s money. But the actual cost of
  treatment is borne by the insurance company, not the individual. The
  individual pays for healthcare as a deduction from his/her paycheck,
  which the employer uses to pay for the insurance plans sponsored by
  the company, along with a sizeable contribution directly from the
  company, out of the company\'s profits. So the bulk of healthcare
  costs are paid for by a portion of your paycheck, and your company.

Under our current system, if you\'re employed by a company of 50
employees or more, you get healthcare from your employer. If you\'re
unemployed, you can buy insurance from a state-run healthcare exchange,
or from the Federal government\'s healthcare exchange. In the United
States, you must buy health insurance, or you pay increased taxes to
cover your lack of contribution to the system. However, you still have
to pay for it, one way or another. There are government subsidies
available if you are unemployed, but that doesn\'t equate to \"free\"
healthcare. It means you can buy an insurance plan at a discount, but
your care still must be paid for by someone.\
\
How to fix this particular issue (i.e. make healthcare more affordable,
reduce the size/influence/necessity of healthcare insurance companies,
ensure that essential care is paid for by tax dollars, etc) is a
political issue that Washington has struggled with for years. Our
current law, the Affordable Care Act, has not adequately addressed these
issues. It has not made healthcare more affordable, it has not reduced
the size or necessity of healthcare insurance, and it has not ensured
that essential care for all people is covered by tax dollars. This is
the big political issue. Solving this will definitely be a challenge for
years to come.
