So your question is asking me whether or not it *depresses* me that most
people will not go to heaven?

No.

The truth of God's word is written on the hearts. Paul wrote the
following:

> Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things
> required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they
> do not have the law. They show that the requirements of the law are
> written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and
> their thoughts sometimes accusing them and at other times even
> defending them. --- Romans 2:14--15 NIV

The requirements of the law are written on their hearts. Even the
Gentiles (who did not have the law) did things required by the law
naturally. That's because the requirements of the law are written on
their hearts.

In other words, everyone knows naturally what is right. Some people
still choose to do what they desire rather than to do what is right.
People are stubborn and refuse to do what is right all the time. There
is nothing surprising about this.

You can rest assured that the people who are going to hell are doing so
by choice, not by accident. They know what is right but they ignore it.
They follow their desires rather than following God's law. And they will
knowingly reap the rewards for their misdeeds.

Why should people's free choices sadden me?
