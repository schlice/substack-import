**Content:** [The law does not allow sentencing guidelines to be
dictated or influenced by the prison system. The prison system is not a
party to the decisions made by judges or juries when determining
sentencing.\
\
And most prisons in the United States are run by the government. There
are some prisons which take over the sentences of certain long-term
prisoners, and they do this under contract with a state. The terms of
the contract determine which prisoners get sent to private prisons, not
decisions by judges or juries.\
\
If you feel that private prisons create more prisoners, feel free to
lobby your state\'s lawmakers and repeal the law which allows for
private prisons in your state.]{.rendered_qtext}
