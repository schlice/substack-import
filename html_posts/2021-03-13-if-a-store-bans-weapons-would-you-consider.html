**If a store bans weapons, would you consider \"if they don\'t know, it
won\'t hurt them\" a valid reason to keep your concealed carry?**

No. Because I respect everyone's rights, and they will respect mine.

The business has the right to ask concealed carriers to disarm before
they come in the store.

I have the right to choose to not go in the store, or I have the right
to voluntarily disarm before I enter the store.

That second choice [[has had dire consequences in the
past.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=39b962&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzanna_Hupp){.external_link

So I would probably choose to exercise my right to take my money
elsewhere.
