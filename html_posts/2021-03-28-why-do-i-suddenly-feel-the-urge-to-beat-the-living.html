**Why do I suddenly feel the urge to beat the living crap out of
someone?**

Because you're a human being. Feeling emotions is normal. Feeling anger
is normal. Wanting to take out your aggression on someone is also
normal.

What ***isn't*** normal is having this feeling ***all of the time*** or
***most of the time***.

If you feel this occasionally, and you're able to control yourself,
congratulations, you're a human. If you feel this all the time, seek
help.
