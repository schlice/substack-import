There are many disorders which can cause the symptoms of MS, but there
are a scant few that cause white spots on an MRI, and there are none
others that I know of which cause lesions which grow in size and number
over the years.

As a matter of fact, there is one disease that is specifically ruled out
by checking to see if there are both old and new lesions. **Acute
disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)** is a disease which causes brief
but intense inflammation in the brain and spinal cord, and sometimes the
optic nerve, as well as causing white-spot-producing damage to myelin.
Neurologists will look for evidence of old and new lesions, which would
indicate a progression in disease more similar to MS than ADEM. At a
first attack with no old lesions, it is difficult to differentiate MS
from ADEM. Doctors will closely monitor patients who experience such
attacks to see if there is reoccurrence to suggest that the disease is
MS.

**Lyme Disease** can sometimes produce positive MRI results, especially
in Lyme which is undiagnosed for long periods of time. Again, though,
progression of disease usually indicates MS and not Lyme. Early Lyme
disease responds well to antibiotics, whereas MS does not.

Finally, **leukodystrophies** are a group of diseases which affect
myelin, or the white matter of the brain. Myelin is made up of about ten
different chemicals. These leukodystrophies affect how the body
metabolizes or produces these chemicals. Each of the leukodystrophies is
a defect in a gene which controls the formation and metabolization of
one of these chemicals. Specifically, they are metachromatic
leukodystrophy, Krabb√© disease, adrenoleukodystrophy,
Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, Canavan disease, Childhood Ataxia with
Central Nervous System Hypomyelination or CACH (also known as Vanishing
White Matter Disease), Alexander disease, Refsum disease, and
cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.

There are likely others, but this is what I came up with off the top of
my head. Hopefully some of my esteemed colleagues can fill in the
blanks.
