**Will the rules and composition of the Senate ever change to be more
representative of the population?**

No, and they should not.

This really goes back to the original reason we have a bicameral
legislature in the first place, what they were designed to do, and the
17th Amendment.

We have a bicameral (two house) legislature in America because of that
age-old argument between the large states and the small states,
resulting in "The Great Compromise," and our two-house legislature of
today.

Consider this:

> The Constitutional Convention included delegates from twelve of the
> original thirteen states. (Rhode Island boycotted the whole thing.)
> Those delegates came from small states and large states. The small
> states, afraid of losing influence in the new government, demanded
> that representation in Congress be awarded on an equal basis to all
> states, no matter how large or small. But the large states insisted,
> no less forcefully, that representation should be based on population;
> since larger states had more voters, they ought to have more votes in
> Congress, too. This fierce dispute over representation dragged on
> throughout the summer of 1787, threatening to derail the entire
> Constitutional Convention. But a bicameral legislature provided the
> perfect opportunity for compromise---in fact, for \"The Great
> Compromise.\" Small states got their equal representation in the
> Senate, large states got their proportional representation in the
> House, and everyone went home happy.

I was considering going into a diatribe about how the 17th Amendment
should be repealed, but I think that what I've given you so far is
enough for now. In short, each state gets equal representation in the
Senate. Each state gets representation based on its size and population
in the House.

And that's never going to change.
