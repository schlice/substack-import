**Do you have to provide identification to a law enforcement officer if
you\'re on a public sidewalk?**

**Physical identification.** There is no requirement to carry
identification unless you are participating in some licensed activity
(driving a car, selling food from a food cart, etc).

**Positively identifying yourself.** There is a difference between
"providing identification" and "providing your real name and address,"
even though the latter is still "providing identification." Whether or
not you have to do the latter depends on what state you live in, and the
circumstances surrounding your conversation with the police.

Under regular circumstances, if you're just chatting with a police
officer, you are having a *consensual conversation* (which is totally
acceptable and normal, like what human beings do). In such a scenario,
you aren't required to tell him or her anything at all in particular.
You can say nothing at all, but that just makes you look weird.

On the other hand, the police could be conducting what is known as a
*Terry stop* (named after the Supreme Court decision which created it,
*Terry v. Ohio*). In that case, you are not having a casual
conversation. You are experiencing *custodial interrogation*, because
you are essentially barred from leaving until the *Terry* stop is
concluded. In this case, whether or not you are required by law to
positively identify yourself and not lie about it differs among the
states. Twenty five states (as of this writing) have a "stop and
identify" law requiring you to provide your real name and address in the
event of a *Terry* stop. In these states, if you are under custodial
interrogation, when you are asked, you are required to provide your real
name and address, and you can be arrested for failing to do this all by
itself. For any other questions, you can exercise your Miranda rights
and remain silent until you've had the chance to talk to a lawyer (just
say "I would like to remain silent" or "I do not want to answer any
questions"). If your state does not have a "stop and identify" law, you
do not have to give your real name or address. This doesn't mean you
won't be arrested, it just means you don't have to say anything at all
(including your real name) until you've talked to your lawyer. If you're
not sure whether or not the police are conducting a *Terry* stop, ask if
you are free to leave. If the police say no, then you are being
temporarily detained, and whether or not you must provide your real name
and address is a matter of law in your state. Be sure you know it.
