Legally, you may have violated Facebook's Terms of Service by creating a
fake account. If you did (and off the top of my head, I'm not sure), you
can be punished by being banned from using Facebook.

If the girl was underage, you can be arrested and charged with receiving
child pornography, but (you say) you didn't download or keep a copy of
the images, so there may only be the Facebook "paper trail" to show that
you did receive the images. If they can tie the fake account to you, you
can be thus charged.

If the girl was not underage, the photos may have simply violated
Facebook's Terms of Service again when she provided them to you on their
platform. They may prohibit sending or receiving adult content (again,
off the top of my head, I'm not sure). She may face a Facebook ban
herself.
