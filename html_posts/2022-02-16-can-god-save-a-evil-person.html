First, you must know that any question which begins with "Can God"
*automatically* ends with **yes, God can.** As the creator of
everything, and without being constrained by anything, God can do
anything.

So: can God save an evil person? Yes, God can. However, salvation is a
gift from God, and *it's already been given*. The next action is for the
person to *accept* the gift.

**And an evil person likely does not want to accept that gift.**

It's not that they *can't* accept the gift, they can. Salvation is
offered to anyone who repents of their sins and confesses Jesus as their
lord and savior. Sadly, the evil person has been swayed by Satan and his
tricks and lies. It's unlikely that the evil person would ever repent of
their sins and confess Jesus as lord.

TL;DR: *Can* it happen? Yes. Is it *likely* to happen? Without a change
in the heart of the evil person, no.
