**I get very angry at those Trump supporters who oppose abortion.**

Well, that's a very specific group of people who receive your anger. Why
not all pro-life people? Why only pro-life people who are Trump
supporters? Doesn't seem really logical.

**We need to show them what it feels like to meddle in the affairs of
other people.**

Why do "we" need to do this? My mother meddles in the affairs of my life
all the time, yet there is no need to "show her what it feels like" to
meddle in someone else's affairs.

**Why can\'t we ban rivals of Joe Biden from having sex in their
bedrooms?**

I don't understand this statement at all. What does disliking the
policies of the current president have to do at all with sex?

Your question is just really confusing. Maybe you can clarify why you're
so angry, and at such a specific group of people.
