You're kidding right now, right?

Oh wait, you're serious?

The Arab nations in the region *want* Hamas there. They *want*
Palestinians there. They don't want them to leave. They also don't want
"unconditional peace" with Israel. **They want "unconditional
destruction" of Israel.**

Those Arabs in Palestine are a *wedge*. As long as they stay, Arabs have
a foothold in Israel. Arab nations can use the Palestinians as a foil to
foment international outrage against "Israeli atrocities" done against
the Palestinians, while summarily ignoring the horrors Hamas inflicts
against its own people.

Arab nations *support* Hamas, even if they publicly make statements
against terror activities.
