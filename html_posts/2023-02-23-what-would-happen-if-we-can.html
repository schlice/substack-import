If you can't find proof of God's existence, you aren't looking. You
don't even have to look hard.

The question is **what will you accept as proof**.

Will you only accept what can be physically or empirically tested? Will
you only accept *physical proof*? Well that doesn't make sense, because
plenty of things exist, things we know exist, that are not physical. Why
would you put God in a different category? Accepting that certain things
exist that are not physical but then demanding that God must be proven
empirically or physically, seems only to be the case if you are trying
to build your test in such a way as to ensure that God cannot pass.

And science can't prove everything. Some things simply cannot be proven
by science. Just off the top of my head, I can give you five examples of
rational beliefs that cannot be proven by science:

1.  mathematics and logic (science can't prove them because science
    presupposes them),
2.  metaphysical truths (such as, there are minds that exist other than
    my own),
3.  ethical judgments (you can't prove by science that the Nazis were
    evil, because morality is not subject to the scientific method),
4.  aesthetic judgments (the beautiful, like the good, cannot be
    scientifically proven), and, ironically
5.  science itself (the belief that the scientific method discovers
    truth can't be proven by the scientific method itself).

So what kind of proof does exist? Why should we believe anything at all?
The proof is found in logic and reason, timeless principles of any
scientific inquiry.

We can prove, through logic, that a creator God exists. God's existence
is evidenced by:

- the beginning of the universe (Cosmological Argument)
- the design of the universe (Teleological Argument/Anthropic Principle)
- the design of life (Teleological Argument)
- the Moral Law (Moral Argument)

These are sound, logical proofs that show, beyond a reasonable doubt,
that God exists.

\

But God has left *just enough ambiguity* in the world to not coerce
anyone who isn't willing to believe. In other words, God won't convince
you, and I can't convince you, ***if you aren't already willing to
believe.***

The reason: **God values your free will.** God is love, and love can
only be freely given; it can never be coerced. So God will never do more
than *woo* you, so to speak. And He wants it that way.

So if your first instinct is to say, "You can't prove God exists, and
you never will," you're absolutely right. With that attitude, you'll
never believe in God's existence.

So it's not on me to convince you of anything. It's on you to be
actually willing to believe. Not listening to the proofs as a skeptic,
because you'll always be skeptical, and you'll always find something to
be skeptical about. That's by design. That means that your free will is
still intact.

It is only when you seek Him with all of your heart that you'll find
Him.
