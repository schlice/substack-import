**Can the Chief Justice allow calling for witnesses by the Democrats in
the Senate trial if President Trump is impeached by the House?**

Procedurally, the Chief Justice is not part of that decision. That
decision will be made by the Senate, as the Constitution permits the
Senate to determine how it will conduct the trial. This means that the
majority will determine the rules, much like the majority in the House
determined the rules for the impeachment investigation.

So practically, it's up to McConnell and the Republicans whether or not
witnesses will be called, how many, and for how long the debate will
continue before any votes are cast.
