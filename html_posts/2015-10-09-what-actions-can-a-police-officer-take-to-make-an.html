**Content:** [I think the premise of the question leads you to believe
that you\'re asking if a police officer should be a father figure to a
fatherless child (which clearly doesn\'t apply to female police
officers, sorry
[[I.L.Mitchell](https://www.quora.com/profile/I-L-Mitchell)]{.qlink_container}).
The question also doesn\'t explain whether or not the child was the
*perpetrator* or an *innocent bystander*, as this would help to
determine whether or not the police officer needs to address the child
*at all.*\
\
I think, if you look at the question at face value, you\'re trying to
ascribe a trait to a police officer that is not only unwarranted, but
inappropriate. A police officer *should not* be a parental fighre to a
child, regardless of that child\'s familial situation. A police officer
should always be approachable, and should always use an appropriate tone
when speaking with anyone, be it adult or child. The police officer
should not be stepping into any family situation whatsoever.\
\
However, assuming the child is an innocent bystander and the officer is
male, really all you can do is reassure the child that everything will
work out and that this is not the end of the world (assuming that it\'s
not; if their remaining parent was a murder suspect, or if they were
killed, this might indeed be the end of the world for that child).\
\
To wit: a recent car accident claimed the lives of this little girl\'s
parents. The Colorado State trooper stepped in, removed the girl from
the situation, and sang to the girl to distract her from the horror of
what was happening just behind them. A candid shot of when that actually
occurred:\

If there is any description of how the police might act as a father
figure to a child in need, you\'re looking at it.
