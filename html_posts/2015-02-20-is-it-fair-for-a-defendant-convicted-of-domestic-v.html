**Content:** [First off, you\'re asking whether or not it\'s \"fair,\"
which is a judgment call by someone who looks at a set of objective
facts and makes a pronouncement. Each person will consider for
themselves whether or not something is \"fair.\"\
\
In our legal system, a judge/jury has a \"range\" of sentences which are
available when a defendant is convicted of a crime. Forr example, a
domestic violence conviction could carry a sentence of \"5 to 20 years\"
in prison (just an example with made-up numbers). Who decides, and how
is it decided, whether you get the minimum or the maximum sentence? In
the sentencing phase of trial, defendants are allowed to present
\"extenuating circumstances\" which may have contributed to the
commission of a crime. The judge and/or jury are allowed to use these
circumstances when determining severity of sentencing. If we didn\'t
allow extenuating circumstances, then there would be no sentencing phase
of trial, and all sentences would be legally prescribed based on the
crime. If you were convicted of the crime, you would automatically
receive the prescribed sentence for that crime. Without flexibility in
sentencing, there can be no allowance for extenuating circumstances at
all. Our legal system says that we can take extenuating circumstances
into account when determining sentencing.]{.rendered_qtext}
