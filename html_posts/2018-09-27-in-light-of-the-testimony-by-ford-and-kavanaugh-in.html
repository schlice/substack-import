**In light of the testimony by Ford and Kavanaugh in the hearing on
9/27, should an FBI investigation have taken place before the hearing?**

No, no FBI investigation should have taken place. The FBI is not in the
business of investigating state crimes. The FBI investigates Federal
crimes, and no federal crime has been alleged to have occurred here.

**Or, should one happen now that it is over?**

No, not the FBI. But if Dr. Ford is so confident in her memory, she
should approach prosecutors in Maryland and make her accusation. There
is no statute of limitations for sexual assault in Maryland, so that it
occurred 36 years ago is not an issue. Maryland investigators can
investigate the crime and determine whether or not they have enough
evidence to move forward and charge Judge Kavanaugh with a sex crime.

And while [[11 Maryland lawmakers have called on Mongomery County to
initiate an
investigation](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d32eb2&url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/several-md-lawmakers-call-for-montgomery-county-investigation-into-sexual-assault-allegations-against-kavanaugh/2018/09/26/48e00584-c1b5-11e8-b338-a3289f6cb742_story.html?noredirect%3Don%26utm_term%3D.6090cc46c21b){.external_link

stated that they follow a "victim-centered" model for investigations.
They released a statement two days ago, part of which read:

> The department recognizes that victims of sexual assault may not want
> to involve law enforcement and/or initiate a criminal investigation,
> and we respect that position. The department, however, stands prepared
> to assist anyone who reports being the victim of a sexual assault.

Therefore, the only way that anyone is going to investigate this is if
Dr. Ford presents herself to law enforcement officials in Mongomery
County, MD, and reports being a victim of sexual assault.
