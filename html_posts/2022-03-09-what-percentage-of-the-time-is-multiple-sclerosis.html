The real answer is that it is very difficult to directly answer this
question.

There are several reasons why this question can't be directly answered,
the most important of which is that **it is very rare that a death has
only one cause**.

"It is rare that deaths only have one cause. By looking at all causes
that contribute to mortality, rather than just focusing on the
underlying causes, we can get a better understanding of important
conditions and contributors to increased mortality risk in a chronic
disease such as MS," said Dr. Elaine Kingwell, from the University of
British Columbia.

[[Her
study](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=378502&url=https://www.medpagetoday.com/resource-centers/multiple-sclerosis-updates/ms-related-mortality/2844){.external_link

identified persons with MS who died, roughly 50% of them had MS listed
as the *underlying cause,* and roughly 75% of them had MS listed as a
*contributing factor*, **but only roughly 5% of the time was MS listed
as the** ***only cause.***

While MS certainly will contribute to a person's overall health, along
with being a big contributor to the causes of death, it is very rare
that MS is the only cause of death.

**TL;DR:** While MS is rarely fatal, it frequently is a contributing or
underlying factor in the deaths of people who have it.
