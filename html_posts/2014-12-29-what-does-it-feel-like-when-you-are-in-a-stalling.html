**Content:** [The only thing I want to add is that to the pilot, stalls
are absolutely positively nothing. Stalls are constantly practiced
during flight school. Nose-high stalls, turning stalls (in both
directions) and landing attitude stalls are drilled on every training
flight. Learning how to recover from these kinds of stalls quickly
without violently and rapidly descending is vital.]{.rendered_qtext}
