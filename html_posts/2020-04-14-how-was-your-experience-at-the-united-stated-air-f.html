**How was your experience at the United Stated Air Force Academy? Are
complaints from Mikey Weinstein\'s Military Religious Freedom Foundation
overblown?**

I have no doubt that some things happened, and Weinstein's organization
definitely cataloged those things that happened.

People should all be aware that the military service academies are
staffed with people who come from society. They are not perfect robotic
automatons who follow social, religious, and ethical guidance to the
letter 100% of the time.

In other words, people make mistakes. People take things too far. I
think everyone understands that.

The problem I have with Mikey Weinstein: he makes the argument that
these problems are **foundational** and **institutionalized,** and not
just at USAFA, but across the Air Force and the military in general.

**This is a claim which is indeed overblown, and is, in a word,
untrue.**

Mikey's organization is founded on a strained reading of the First
Amendment. The actual words of the First Amendment:

> Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
> prohibiting the free exercise thereof.

The MRFF mission statement shows exactly where they have gone off the
rails (**emphasis** mine):

"The Military Religious Freedom Foundation is the sole nonprofit civil
rights organization dedicated to ensuring that all members of the United
States Armed Forces fully receive the Constitutional guarantee of both
freedom of religion **and freedom from religion**, to which they and all
Americans are entitled."

The First Amendment says two things about religion:

- Congress can't write a law establishing a Federal religion
- Congress can't write a law prohibiting anyone from freely practicing
  their religion, or no religion at all.

A strained reading of that second bullet (with a healthy dose of
entitlement and poor logic skills) says, "well, if I have the right to
practice no religion at all, then I also have the more broadly-worded
'freedom from religion' --- I have the right to be free from any mention
of religion."

This is a Constitutionally unsupported position, primarily because the
Constitution (primarily the Bill of Rights) is a compilation of
"negative rights" --- things that the government cannot do. The
government cannot write a law establishing a Federal religion. The
government cannot search your property without a warrant. The government
cannot force you to testify against yourself. The Constitution is not a
document of "positive rights." It does not grant rights which did not
previously exist. In other words, the Constitution doesn't grant you the
right to life. The Constitution recognizes that a right to life is
pre-existent, and restricts the government from unlawfully taking your
life.

In other words, while the Constitution prohibits the government from
establishing a state religion and allowing you to practice whatever
religion you choose (or none at all), this does not confer an
*obligation* on the government to keep you free from religion if you
choose. You may see religious symbols. You may hear people talk about
their religion. These may even happen on government property. None of
this is prohibited by the Constitution. Only if the government passes a
law establishing a state religion would this run afoul of the
Constitution. If you don't want to practice religion, don't. You're just
as free to go into another room as someone is free to practice their
religion in a room.

Unfortunately, this idea that government has an obligation to keep you
free from religion has invaded the minds of military leaders who are
just a little bit too worried about what people like Weinstein think.
