The answer is "it depends."

Here's a brief, not-complete list of some of the disqualifying mental
health conditions. Note that a waiver process does exist, and in
general, if you can show that the particular condition has been
successfully overcome, you may be able to get a waiver. You will have to
work with your recruiter on this. Make sure you are open and honest with
your recruiter, and if your condition is disqualifying, take heart: over
71% of the American population is ineligible for military service
because of some disqualifying condition. ICD codes are listed in
parenthesis.

You should also know that mental conditions are the most rigid standards
in the Air Force, more so than any other disqualifying medical
condition. Even while the diagnoses of some of these disorders may be
subjective, the military is very unwavering in disqualifying candidates
due to these conditions.

- **ADD/ADHD or Perceptual/Learning Disorder(s)** (315) is disqualifying
  unless the applicant can demonstrate passing academic performance and
  there has been no use of medication in the previous 12 months. Waivers
  may be issued for these disorders.
- **Organic/functional mental disorders:** Current or history of
  academic skills or perceptual defects secondary to organic or
  functional mental disorders, including, but not limited to dyslexia,
  that interfere with school or employment, are disqualifying. However,
  applicants demonstrating passing academic and employment performance
  without academic and/ or work accommodations at any time in the
  previous 12 months may be qualified.
- **Psychotic disorders:** Current or history of disorders with
  psychotic features such as schizophrenia (295), paranoid disorder
  (297), and other unspecified psychosis (298) is disqualifying.
- **Mood disorders:** Mood disorders such as depression, bipolar
  disorder, psychoses, and other unspecified depressive issues are
  disqualifying. Any history of mood disorders requiring medication
  and/or outpatient care for longer than six months by a mental health
  professional is also disqualifying. Also, any symptoms of mood and
  mental issues that affect social ability, school, and learning, or
  work efficiency are disqualifying. Current or history of adjustment
  disorders within the previous three months is disqualifying.
- **Behavioral disorders:** Behavioral disorders history in school and
  with law enforcement agencies having to get involved due to dangerous
  behavior to self or others is disqualifying. Antisocial attitudes or
  behaviors are disqualifying as people who exhibit these symptoms are
  typically not adaptive to military service.\
  \
  Any history of personality disorder that is demonstrated by documented
  and recurring inability to remain in a school environment, work with
  employers, fellow employees or participate in social groups are
  disqualifying.\
  \
  **NOTE**: Any psychological testing that reveals a high degree of
  immaturity, instability, personality issues, impulsiveness, or
  dependency which could interfere with the ability to conform to the
  rules and regulations of the Armed Forces is disqualifying.
- If a person has a current or history of behavior disorders that
  include but not limited to the following conditions:
  - Enuresis or encopresis after the 13th birthday is disqualifying.
  - Sleepwalking after 13th birthday is disqualifying.
  - Eating disorders such as anorexia, bulimia, or other unspecified
    eating disorders lasting longer than three months and occurring
    after the 14th birthday is also disqualifying.
- **Speech disorders:** Any speech impediment, stammering, stuttering or
  other receptive or expressive language disorder that may significantly
  interfere with the ability to repeat commands is disqualifying.
- **Anxiety, self-harm, and phobias:** Any history of suicidal behavior,
  that includes discussions, gestures, or the actual attempt is
  disqualifying. A history of self-mutilation is also disqualifying.\
  \
  Anxiety issues, either current or historical, or panic, agoraphobia,
  social phobia, simple phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorders, other
  acute reactions to stress, and posttraumatic stress are disqualifying
  for entry into the service.\
  \
  Any history or current disorder of being dissociative or
  de-personalization are disqualifying.\
  \
  Any history or current somatoform disorders, including, but not
  limited to hypochondriasis or chronic pain disorder, are
  disqualifying.\
  \
  Any history or current issue with alcohol dependence, drug dependence,
  alcohol abuse, or other drug abuse is
  disqualifying.[\[1\]](#JZkzx){#cite-JZkzx .citation_link}
