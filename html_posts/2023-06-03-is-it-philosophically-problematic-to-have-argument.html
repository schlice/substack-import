Not at all. In fact, I believe that belief in a creator god is
philosophically sound. The reason why I say this is because there is
positive, empirically detectable evidence for a creator god, regardless
of whether or not atheists want to acknowledge it. It would be
philosophically problematic if it were an argument from ignorance, or an
argument inserting an intelligent cause into a gap in our knowledge.

> How does faith factor into these arguments?

What we know about God is knowledge gained by *induction*. Induction is
the process of gaining information by drawing general conclusions from
specific observations. This process is distinct from the process of
*deduction*, in which we line up premises in a valid argument to arrive
at a conclusion.

Much of what you know, you know through induction. In fact, you've
probably already used induction to investigate the truth in the
arguments I provided in the previous section. Namely, you have
determined that since it would be philosophically problematic to base
your belief of the existence of God on an argument from ignorance or a
"god of the gaps" fallacy, it would not be problematic to base your
belief on positive, empirically detectable evidence for a creator. This
information was gained through induction.

It is also true that the vast majority of information gained through
induction can never be 100% certain. It can only be *highly probable.*
For example, are you absolutely, 100% certain that gravity makes all
objects drop? No, because you haven't observed all objects being
dropped. Likewise, are you absolutely certain that all men are mortal?
No, because you haven't observed all men die. Perhaps there's someone
somewhere who hasn't died or will not die in the future. In fact, we
arrive at most decisions in life---from what we eat to whom we choose
for friends---through observation and induction. We don't have perfect
information about the liquid in a Campbell's Soup can---we think it's
edible and won't poison us---but we're not 100% certain. We are relying
on our prior experience that Campbell's Soup is trustworthy, and we are
concluding that there's actually Campbell's Soup and not poison in the
can. Likewise, we don't have perfect information about the character of
people we may meet. But after spending some time with them, we may
conclude that they are trustworthy people. Are we 100% certain? No,
because we are generalizing from our limited number of experiences. Our
conclusion may be highly probable, but it is not certain. This is the
case with many decisions we make in life.

So if inductive conclusions are not certain, can they be trusted? Yes,
but to varying degrees of certainty. Since no human being possesses
infinite knowledge, most of our inductive conclusions can be wrong. But
even when we don't have complete or perfect information, we often have
enough information to make reasonably certain conclusions on most
questions in life. Back to our "are all men mortal" question, since
virtually everyone has been observed to die, your conclusion that all
men are mortal is considered true beyond a reasonable doubt; it's
99-plus percent sure, but it's not beyond any doubt. It takes some
faith---albeit a very small amount---to believe it. The same can be said
for concluding that gravity affects all objects, not just some. The
conclusion is practically certain but not absolutely certain. In other
words, we can be sure beyond a reasonable doubt, but not sure beyond all
doubt.

Faith, therefore, bridges the gap between our knowledge and our belief.
When we possess some knowledge by induction, we need some faith to
overcome any remaining doubt. Since our conclusion about the fact that
all men are mortal is almost certain, we don't need a lot of faith to
believe it. But if we lack inductive knowledge of a premise, it would
take *more* faith to believe it.

This is where we stand when we discuss having faith in a creator god.
Since we have positive, empirically-detectable evidence for a creator
god, it doesn't take as much faith to believe. Conversely, the atheist
can produce **no** **positive, empirically-detectable evidence** that a
creator god does not exist. Therefore, the atheist requires **much more
faith** to believe his position than the theist requires to believe his.

Think about that. What that means is that it requires more faith to be
an atheist than it does to be a theist.
