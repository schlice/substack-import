**If the House waits to send articles of impeachment to the Senate until
after Donald Trump\'s (hypothetical) re-election, are they still valid?
Do articles of impeachment expire with a president\'s term in office if
not sent to the Senate for a vote?**

This is a great question.

Articles of Impeachment do not complete their process until they are
adjudicated by the Senate. Therefore, if the Articles are not
transmitted to the Senate by the end of the current Congressional term
(January 3, 2021), they will expire, just as any other bill which does
not complete its Congressional journey.

As Professor Turley said, impeachment is not a vote, it is a process. In
order to be considered a fully Constitutionally valid process, it must
be allowed to complete.

Holding your breath until you get your way, Nancy, didn't work when you
were a little girl, and it won't work today.
