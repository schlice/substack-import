They could, but it would be a really bad idea.

If a tree encroaches onto a neighboring property, and the homeowner is
prohibited from maintaining his property by HOA rules, the homeowner
could sue the HOA for facilitating a tort trespass. After all, it is
only the HOA's rule which prevents the homeowner from addressing the
tort trespass, because without the rule, the homeowner can directly
address the issue themselves.

And Heaven forbid your property is damaged because of a tree encroaching
into your yard. The HOA would be *financially liable* for the damages,
because it was their rules which prevented you from addressing the
encroachment. Make sure you save any and all correspondence with the HOA
where you attempt to get them to either allow you to address the issue
or to get them to address it themselves.
