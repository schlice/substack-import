**Content:** [There is no law that prevents anyone from saying something
racist. In fact, racist statements are protected under the First
Amendment.\
\
Anyone has the right to be an ass. They don\'t have the right to
*discriminate* because they are an ass. But making a racist statement is
legal.\
\
However, that said, an officer should never make such statements.
Members of the public have more power to effect change in such a
situation than other officers, and should be reporting such incidents to
the police department by filing an official statement or visiting
Internal Affairs in that department.\
\
It would be very hard for fellow officers to report other officers for
making racist statements. An officer might casually approach the racist
officer\'s supervisor and say something about how officer X should
probably learn some tact. But beyond that, it\'s hard to turn someone in
for being an ass.]{.rendered_qtext}
