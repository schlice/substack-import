**Content:** [In the end, the largest amount of funds for each
country\'s contributions to the search will come from that country.
Potentially, some funds the US has set aside for international aid could
be re-allocated back to the Navy and the Air Force to offset some of the
costs of the humanitarian aid missions in which they are currently
participating.\
\
If a nation or a faction were found to be \"at fault\" when this is all
over, we may seek redress from that nation or faction. Likely, we won\'t
get anything monetarily from that group, so we would redirect some
international aid money that was supposed to go to that country and use
it to repay the military.\
\
Other than the show of goodwill to the rest of the world, there is
little fiscal or national security benefit to the US\' participation in
this search. This is why the funding (internally) would likely not come
from the US defense budget. If there was no other location to get funds
than the defense budget, we would be using money for our own national
defense to look for an airplane, and we would have to weigh the cost of
doing so against defending the United States.]{.rendered_qtext}
