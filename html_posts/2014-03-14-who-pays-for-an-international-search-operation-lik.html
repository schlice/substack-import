<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [In the end, the largest amount of funds for each<br>country\'s contributions to the search will come from that country.<br>Potentially, some funds the US has set aside for international aid could<br>be re-allocated back to the Navy and the Air Force to offset some of the<br>costs of the humanitarian aid missions in which they are currently<br>participating.\<br>\<br>If a nation or a faction were found to be \"at fault\" when this is all<br>over, we may seek redress from that nation or faction. Likely, we won\'t<br>get anything monetarily from that group, so we would redirect some<br>international aid money that was supposed to go to that country and use<br>it to repay the military.\<br>\<br>Other than the show of goodwill to the rest of the world, there is<br>little fiscal or national security benefit to the US\' participation in<br>this search. This is why the funding (internally) would likely not come<br>from the US defense budget. If there was no other location to get funds<br>than the defense budget, we would be using money for our own national<br>defense to look for an airplane, and we would have to weigh the cost of<br>doing so against defending the United States.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
