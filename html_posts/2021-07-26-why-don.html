Let's take your two questions one at a time and apply a little good
old-fashioned logic.

> **Why don\'t people who refuse to get vaccinated against COVID-19
> think that they can die from the disease or even spread a deadly
> strain?**

The short answer has nothing to do with healthcare or medicine, and has
everything to do with ***distrust of the government***.

The government has botched the handling of this pandemic from the
beginning. It politicized the virus, and the vaccine. And now it has
backed the notion that we need *forced vaccinations* in order to end the
pandemic (we'll get to that in a minute).

If the government would have instead given everyone the cold hard facts
from the beginning, about who the vaccine is best suited for, and who
might not benefit from the vaccine, and then leave everyone the hell
alone and treat them like adults, we'd be better off. That's how you do
public health. That's how public health gains trust. That's how public
health becomes effective. **And that's how the pandemic ends.**

> **Everyone must be vaccinated or this pandemic will never end?**

And this is the biggest lie that the government and the media could have
foisted upon you. **And you bought it.**

Nearly all of the hospitalizations from COVID since May (including with
the Delta variant) have been among those who are unvaccinated. There
have been a shockingly low number of "breakthrough infections" which are
people who have been fully vaccinated and then had gone on to get
COVID-19.

What this tells us is that vaccinated people won't get sick, and
unvaccinated people will.

**And that choice belongs with each person.**

Once you're vaccinated, you're covered. That's the bit that the
government and the media is fear-mongering around. Yes, there have been
the random cases of breakthrough infection, but the exception is not the
rule. For the vast majority of those vaccinated, you simply won't get
COVID-19 or any of its variants. But we're also finding that people who
got COVID are also protected against re-infection, and the variants.

So this tells us that eventually, everyone will either get the vaccine,
or will get sick and get better (or die). And this is how the pandemic
will end.

Not endless masks. Not forced vaccinations. Not fear mongering. Good
science and honest conversations will end the pandemic.

Original question:

Why don\'t people who refuse to get vaccinated against COVID-19 think
that they can die from the disease or even spread a deadly strain?
Everyone must be vaccinated or this pandemic will never end?
