**Should the USA amend the Constitution and have amendments to the
Constitution added by a two thirds majority vote of the whole population
instead of the current system?**

Yes. We should do this at the same time that we amend the Constitution
to repeal Article II, Section 1, and the relevant section of the 12th
Amendment which allows for the Electoral College. That way, not only can
we have a direct popular vote to amend the Constitution, but we can have
a direct popular vote for President, instead of this whole outdated
Electoral College thing.

You'll still need to get such an amendment passed under the current
rules (2/3 majority in both houses of Congress or a Constitutional
Convention called by 2/3 of the states, and the amendment ratified by
3/4 of the states) to make it pass.

So 38 states will have to vote to give up their sovereignty in order to
pass this amendment. I'd say your amendment has a snowball's chance in
Hell of passing, but that's giving the amendment too much credit.

While you're at it, you should probably add the following amendments,
too:

- Get rid of states. Call them "provinces" or "Federal operating
  regions," but get rid of them altogether. No more state Constitutions.
  One Federal constitution. One set of Federal laws that applies to
  everyone. That's more fair, isn't it?
- In order to get 2/3 of the whole population to vote, you're going to
  have to make it mandatory to vote. While only 2/3 of the country is
  eligible to vote (it was estimated in 2016 that 250,056,000 citizens
  were eligible to vote), only 55% of that number, or 138,847,000,
  actually did vote. So only half of the eligible voters voted.
  Therefore, you will have to make it illegal not to vote if you're
  eligible. That will be the only way you can ever get 2/3 of the
  country to actually vote.

All of these have about an equal likelihood of passing.
