**Content:** [I think this goes way beyond Baltimore. This sort of
behavior sends a strong message to cops: if the public thinks you\'re
wrong, the city for whom you work will arrest you and prosecute you for
doing nothing more than your job. Honest mistakes? No more. Can\'t make
them. But whether or not you\'ve done your job correctly is no longer
relevant. It\'s all about perception. Doesn\'t matter whether or not you
followed procedure to the letter. If it looks bad, it is bad. And
that\'s a problem, as many arrest control tactics look really bad even
though they don\'t really cause lasting physical trauma.\
\
For example, one arrest control technique involves kneeling on the
suspect from the side, one knee in the back and one knee in the crook of
the neck. What you can\'t see is that 95% of the officers weight is on
the knee in the back. The knee at the neck simply prevents the suspect
from raising his head, there is no real body weight there. But from the
bystanders point of view, it looks like the officer is crushing the
suspect\'s neck with his knee.\
\
Batons also look much more brutal than they are. Officers try to counter
this perceived \"beating\" by performing targeted pressure point strikes
that can incapacitate with few blows.\
\
And if prosecutors are not going to stand behind their officers, if
prosecutors are going to jump to arraign officers for doing their jobs,
you will see fewer officers going \"above and beyond\" to stop crime,
for fear that their actions will land them in jail.\
\
I predict that if prosecutors around the country behave as they did in
Baltimore, it will have a chilling effect on law enforcement, and a
corresponding increase in violent crimes.]{.rendered_qtext}
