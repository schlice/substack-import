I suppose that ***IF*** Satan was defeated at the cross, he shouldn't be
causing chaos any more.

But I have news for you. **Satan wasn't defeated at the cross.**

The cross accomplished two things:

1.  Jesus defeated ***SIN*** at the cross. Remember Jewish custom was to
    sacrifice a lamb who had ceremonially taken on the sins of the
    people for that year, right? Plus, they had to do it every year just
    to cover the sins for that year. Jesus became the "Lamb of God" as
    He took on the sin of the world: past, present, and future. Jesus
    died "once, for all." Satan's big hook was separating us from God by
    tricking us into sin. But now that Jesus has taken away the penalty
    for our sin, Satan's tricks (which still exist) have no power over
    us. Satan has been "de-fanged." For those of us who have been saved,
    Satan may still trick us into sin, but those sins do not change our
    salvation.
2.  Jesus defeated ***DEATH*** at His resurrection. When Jesus returned
    from the grave, death lost its power over us. Death is no longer the
    end. Death is now the beginning.

Rest assured, Satan ***will be*** defeated. Satan ***will be*** cast
into hell, along with his demons. But that's not projected to happen
until the Tribulation is over, when Jesus returns.

So no, Satan wasn't defeated at the cross. Sin and death were defeated
at the cross. Satan will be defeated at the end of the world.
