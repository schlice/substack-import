**How is an employer able to age out a child from a group dental plan at
age 23? Was there some kind of exception allowed in certain cases under
the ACA, or is the employer in violation of the ACA?**

Health care reform doesn't apply to separately contracted services like
vision and dental. They are classified as "excepted benefits" under most
state health care regulations.

In most cases, dental carriers will follow the new ACA healthcare
standard of 26 years old at a patient's request, but they are under no
Federal mandate to do so.
