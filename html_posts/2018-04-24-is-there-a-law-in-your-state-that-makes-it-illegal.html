**Is there a law in your state that makes it illegal to \"threaten\" to
file a complaint against law enforcement?**

There is no law in my state that makes it illegal to threaten to file a
complaint against a law enforcement officer. There's not one in yours,
either.

As with all things, the devil is in the details.

The charge is not "threatening to file a complaint against law
enforcement." No such statute exists in any state. However, there is
indeed a statute in my state (and probably in yours) making
*intimidation of a public official* a crime. Intimidating a federal
official is (obviously) a Federal offense as well (Threatening a
government official of the United States, 18 USC ยง 871).

However, the intimidation statutes are overly broad. The statute should
contain an intent clause. While basically any threats made against a
public official in order to gain something that they could not
ordinarily get would meet the plain letter of the statute, threats to
take lawful action (i.e. filing a police report) are not "true threats."
In fact, the filing of the police report is a right which the public
has, and therefore cannot be illegal. So unless the intent was to gain a
result to which you would normally not be entitled to, there is no "true
threat."
