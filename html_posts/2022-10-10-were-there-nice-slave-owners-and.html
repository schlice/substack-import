I'm certain that you are thinking of the American colonies when you are
discussing slavery, but did you know that slavery existed in the Bible?

But slavery in the Bible was very different than the slavery we
experienced in the times of colonial America. **The slavery in the Bible
was not based on race**. Most slavery in Biblical times was **voluntary
servitude**: people sold themselves as slaves when they could not pay
their bills or provide for their families.

The Bible actually condemns race-based slavery when it says that all men
are created by God in His image (Genesis 1:27). It also condemns, in
both the Old and New Testaments, the practice of "man-stealing" wherein
Africans were kidnapped by African slave hunters, sold to slave traders,
and shipped to the New World to become slaves and work on plantations.
The Old Testament says, "Whoever steals a man and sells him, and anyone
found in possession of him, shall be put to death." (Exodus 21:16 ESV).
The New Testament also condemns the practice: slave traders are called
"ungodly and sinful" (1 Tim 1:8--10).

However, the Old Testament did allow for economic-based slavery and
regulated it. But that slavery looked nothing like the race-based
slavery we experienced in early America.

While I bet that no slave was truly "content," because man is designed
to be free and to exercise free will, I'm certain that some of the
Biblical slaves were a lot like indentured servants or office workers.
They didn't really "love" their bosses, but they did the work because
they needed the money. Our modern employment system has grown and
matured significantly, but has as its foundation the voluntary and
indentured servitude that has existed since Biblical times.
