**Content:** [You can\'t compare the United States (where gun ownership
is a protected right) to the rest of the world (where gun ownership is a
privilege which can, and often is, heavily restricted).\
\
Force is met with force, and in a society in which guns are allowed,
force can and should be met with deadly force. The move to disarm and
\"neuter\" the police force because you don\'t like criminals getting
killed will only lead to more officers getting hurt because they will
now have to second-guess themselves every time they roll up on a call.\
\
You\'ll also see a much higher usage of TASERs, along with a much higher
usage of body cams so they police can justify their
actions.]{.rendered_qtext}
