<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You can\'t compare the United States (where gun ownership<br>is a protected right) to the rest of the world (where gun ownership is a<br>privilege which can, and often is, heavily restricted).\<br>\<br>Force is met with force, and in a society in which guns are allowed,<br>force can and should be met with deadly force. The move to disarm and<br>\"neuter\" the police force because you don\'t like criminals getting<br>killed will only lead to more officers getting hurt because they will<br>now have to second-guess themselves every time they roll up on a call.\<br>\<br>You\'ll also see a much higher usage of TASERs, along with a much higher<br>usage of body cams so they police can justify their<br>actions.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
