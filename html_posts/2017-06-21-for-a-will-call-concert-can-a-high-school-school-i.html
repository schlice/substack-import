If you were allowed to buy a ticket at 13, they would have to accept
whatever ID would be common for a 13 year old to possess. A school ID
would be about the best you could have (and that's not even standard, so
if you have one, you're ahead of the game).

I would most definitely present my school ID card to pick up the
tickets.
