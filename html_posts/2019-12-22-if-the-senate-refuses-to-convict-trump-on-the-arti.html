**If the Senate refuses to impeach Trump, can they vote to censure in
some way thereby acknowledging misdeeds that fail to rise to the level
of impeachable offenses?**

The Senate can do whatever the Senate chooses to do with its time.

As far as the impeachment goes, the Senate only has the option to vote
on each Article of Impeachment and determine whether or not the person
impeached will be removed from office. This vote must be a supermajority
(67 or more Senators).

If they vote to remove the person from office, they can then vote by
simple majority whether or not the person can ever hold public office
again.

After all this impeachment nonsense is finally done, the Senate can
indeed choose to vote to pass an article of censure. Censure is a
reprimand issued by one or both houses of Congress. It is documented in
the Constitution as a punishment for Members of Congress, but not for
non-Members. For them, it is simply a means of formally documenting
displeasure with a non-Member.

There are no consequences tied to censure for non-Members. In fact,
since 1800, Members of the House and Senate have introduced resolutions
of censure against at least 12 sitting Presidents, so when conduct fails
to rise to the level of an impeachable offense, a censure can indeed be
used. [[Some of those
censures](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0248c1&url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R45087.pdf){.external_link

*unconstitutional, usurpation, reproof*, and *abuse of power*. Beginning
in 1972, the most "censorious" resolutions have actually used the word
*censure* in the text.

So as you can see, abuse of power does not always rise to the level of
impeachment. Some abuses of power historically have only resulted in
censure.
