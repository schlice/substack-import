**As someone who is most interested in the Marines, what are some
benefits to the Air Force, disregarding pay?**

I want to add something here. Most of my esteemed colleagues have
pointed out the differences between the Air Force and the Marines. And
they're not far off the mark as far as quality of life goes in either
service. No one will argue that your quality of life will be better in
the Air Force than it would be in the Marines.

But no one explained **why** that is. I mean, there has to be a reason
that one is better than the other. Is it simply because one is a bunch
of pansies and the other is where the real men go? It can't be that
simplistic.

Of course, it's not.

It has *everything* to do with the **mission.**

One sentence should tell you most of what you need to know when trying
to figure out why the Air Force and the Marines look so different.

*In the Marine Corps, everyone is a rifleman first, and a MOS second. In
the Air Force, only 13% of the personnel actually fly planes (although
that number is changing with RPA). Everyone else performs some other
support function.*

When 87% of your entire service performs support functions, you can see
why they spend their time ensuring that they are comfortable, as this is
all they do.

is absolutely correct that the one thing that the Marines can offer you
is that you are a Marine. Once a Marine, always a Marine. No one is ever
an "ex-Marine" or a "retired Marine." You're always and forever a
Marine. I know Marines in my area who are in their 70s now, and they are
still high and tight, just as sharp as when they were 30, although maybe
not quite as quick as they were before. If that's the military
experience you're looking for, then the Marines is for you.

If you're looking to hone your skills in some of the most highly
technical and intellectually demanding career fields in the entire
military, be on the bleeding edge of technology and lead the charge into
space, then the Air Force is where you want to be. If you want skills
that are virtually guaranteed to be transferrable to a well-paying
civilian career once you're done on Active Duty, the Air Force is the
place for you.

Is one or the other an "advantage?" It solely depends on what you want
to do.
