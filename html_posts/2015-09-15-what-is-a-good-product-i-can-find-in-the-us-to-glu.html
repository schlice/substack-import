**Content:** [I am surprised that you need glue. You should be able to
get the wire under the headliner or behind the trim of your dooorposts.\
\
But if you must use glue, I would suggest Goop. It dries to a clear
rubbery consistency and can be peeled off if you don\'t need it
anymore.]{.rendered_qtext}
