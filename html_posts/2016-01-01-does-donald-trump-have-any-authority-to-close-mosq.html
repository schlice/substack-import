**Content:** [First, he would have to designate radical Islam a
terrorist organization. There have been Islamic terrorist organizations
on the Terror Watch List for years, adding radical Islam could be done
if it could be clearly defined.\
\
Once radical Islam (which is separate from traditional Islam) is
designated a terrorist organization, you can close the radical Islamic
mosques (i don\'t know how you can know that a mosque teaches radical
Islam, but still there it is), freeze the funds, and jail the terrorists
in Gitmo. This would be a valid exception to the First Amendment,
because the restriction on terrorists is a valid state interest, and the
limitation only affects radical Islam.\
