**Content:** [You\'ve denoted two different types of checkpoints: border
checkpoints (which include interior checkpoints) and state/county/local
checkpoints.\
\
Border checkpoints are the ones along the national border and within 100
miles of the border. Those checkpoints are manned by Customs and Border
Patrol.\
\
At the border, CBP doesn\'t need reasonable suspicion or probable cause
to search your vehicle; all persons entering into the United States are
subject to search, and you crossing the border constitutes your implicit
consent to search.\
\
Interior border checkpoints (within 100 miles of the border) are a
little different. To stop your vehicle, they need \"reasonable
suspicion\" that you\'re involved with something related to the border
that you shouldn\'t be (and this is usually more than a \"hunch\" or a
\"guess\"). To search your vehicle, they need \"probable cause\" that
you are involved in illegal border activity (smuggling or harboring
border jumpers). Note that frequently these rules are ignored, as CBP
isn\'t generally well-trained on their responsibilities and the legal
limits of their authority, and supervision is thin at best. In practice,
they tend to apply their rights from the actual border to the interior
border checkpoints, which is not valid. According to the ACLU,
Constitutional rights are frequently violated at these interior
checkpoints, and innocent people (US citizens) are routinely the
victims.\
\
DUI checkpoints (or sobriety checkpoints) are conducted by State or
local police or county sheriffs offices. They are a great way for
officers to check your tags and get a quick whiff of your breath or the
inside of your vehicle. Your rights apply at a DUI checkpoint just as
they do with any other traffic stop; they are absolutely no different.
Officers have to have probable cause to search your vehicle and they
have to have a reasonable suspicion that you have been drinking before
they can stop you, or you consent to a search.]{.rendered_qtext}
