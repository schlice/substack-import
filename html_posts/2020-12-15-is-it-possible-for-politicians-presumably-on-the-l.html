**Is it possible for politicians, presumably on the left wing, to remove
the 2nd Amendment from the constitution? I\'m not saying I actually want
this, but I\'ve seen many people say there\'s no need for the 2nd
Amendment.**

The process for removing an amendment is in the Constitution. It
requires passing another amendment which supersedes the previous one.
You must follow the same process for the new amendment as for any new
amendment: the proposed amendment must be approved by a 2/3 majority in
Congress (both houses), and then must be ratified by 3/4 of the states
(38).

So can Democrats remove the 2nd Amendment from the Constitution? Not by
themselves.
