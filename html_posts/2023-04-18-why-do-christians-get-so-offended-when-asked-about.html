I have never seen a Christian get offended when asked about their faith.
Ever.

I will admit that some Christians have what you might call "blind
faith." They can't articulate the basis of their faith, they don't
understand the scientific foundations behind their belief, they just
believe because "the Bible tells them so." But *why*? Is the Bible
trustworthy? Are the things written in the Bible true? How can you tell?
Does absolute truth even exist?

There are actually very real, substantial, scientifically-based answers
to those questions. But it takes effort to learn those answers.

There is also a component of what proof you will accept. If God is
immaterial, you're not going to prove God's existence using the physical
sciences. But logic and reason are the very foundations of science, and
we can use logic and reason to prove God's existence.
