**Why is it illegal in some states to drive under the influence of
marijuana,**

It's illegal in every state to drive impaired. The *source* of the
impairment is irrelevant, whether it be from alcohol, prescription
medication, sleeping pills, NyQuilâ„¢, or anything else you ingest that
may impair motor function.

**yet I can\'t find any proof that it impairs driving?**

The proof is in the pudding, as they say.

A charge of impaired driving starts with a law enforcement officer
observing behavior which may indicate a driver who is under the
influence of a substance which impairs motor function. The officer stops
the vehicle and performs some roadside tests which demonstrate the
driver's ability to function. This *body of evidence* is then used to
make a determination as to whether or not the driver is impaired.

The truth is we don't have to know exactly what substance is impairing
the driver. We don't have to know how much of the substance was
ingested. There doesn't need to be a Breathalyzer test to determine how
much THC is present in the bloodstream. Impaired driving is a traffic
infraction wherein the driver is impaired by an ingested substance which
so affects motor function that driving a car becomes unsafe. It is a
*subjective* charge made by the officer.

**TL;DR: The substance itself doesn't determine whether or not you can
be charged with driving under the influence. The driver's motor
functions do.**
