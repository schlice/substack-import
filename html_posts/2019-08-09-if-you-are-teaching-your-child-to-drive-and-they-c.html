**If you are teaching your child to drive and they cause a accident in
which there is considerable property damage and injuries are you still
covered under your policy even if you where not the one driving?**

Virtually every state in the country has some form of graduated driver's
license model. Most states have drivers start off as "provisional" or
"learners." You've probably heard that a young person has a "learner's
permit" in order to drive with a licensed adult.

So long as the child is following the state laws regarding eligibility
and enrollment for their learner's permit (in other words, they are
eligible for and have their permit), and you were operating the vehicle
in accordance with state laws regarding permit drivers, then you are
covered and insurance will also still cover you under your policy (as
the adult in the car).
