**How does the fact that there is a whistle blower describing evidence
that the Trump administration is interfering with mandatory audits for
all Presidents\' and Vice Presidents\' taxes strengthen the case for
Congress to see President Trump\'s taxes?**

1.  It doesn't pass the smell test. We also have very public knowledge
    that the President has placed his assets in trust and that he
    donates his salary (or its equivalent) to charity. Why exactly would
    he want to conceal his returns from audit after he has become
    President? It makes very little sense.
2.  It's not physically possible to prevent the IRS, the very agency
    with which you file your taxes, from then subsequently auditing
    them. They already possess the returns; the President (or his staff)
    cannot stop the audit process. If this is actually occurring, it is
    a problem within the IRS, not with the President.
3.  The IRS has claimed that they have audited the President's tax
    returns. So who is lying? The IRS, or the whistleblower? Has the
    IG's office been engaged to look into this whistleblower's claims?
4.  EVEN IF ALL THIS WERE TRUE, this *still* doesn't strengthen
    Congress' case to see the tax returns.
    1.  Congress is known to leak like a sieve, which will cause more
        damage to the President than Congress will gain by seeing his
        returns. Democrats in Congress have a vested interest in
        actually leaking those returns so they can use them as political
        ammunition. They have already visually demonstrated the depths
        to which they will sink in order to harm their political
        enemies. This situation does not seem as if it would be any
        different.
    2.  If Congress needs to see how laws are being implemented, they
        only need to subpoena the IRS agents and directors. If those
        people refuse to testify, they should be held in contempt of
        Congress. There's been a lot of bloviating about holding
        individuals in contempt of Congress, but for all of their tough
        talk, I don't see the courts actually holding any of those
        contempt charges up for scrutiny.
    3.  Congress should have turned those contempt charges over to the
        US Attorney's Office for continued investigation. Why has this
        not been done? Could it be because Congress' agenda isn't really
        determining how effectively the law is being followed, but
        actually trying to dig up dirt on the President? Who can say,
        really...
    4.  Congress is only authorized to see aggregate tax data, not tax
        data on identifiable individuals. Congress is not the FBI, they
        are not the Inspector General, and they are not the IRS. They
        need to stay in their lane.
