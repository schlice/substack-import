**Content:** [In addition to what [[Cliff
G.](https://www.quora.com/profile/Cliff-G-13)]{.qlink_container} already
said, the courts have also determined that Miranda doesn\'t apply when
you are pulled over and talking to an officer there. The \"temporary
detention\" you experience when an officer stops your vehicle does not
amount to \"custodial interrogation,\" so you don\'t have the right to
remain silent until you\'ve had the chance to talk to your attorney. You
do have to answer questions related to your driving, ownership of the
car, license, registration, insurance, etc. You don\'t have to answer
quetions ***not related to why you were stopped.***\
\
If you were stopped because you and your vehicle matched the description
of someone who just robbed the gas station a half a block away, you\'re
in a whole different ballgame. This is a custodial interrogation, and if
you refuse to answer questions, you can expect to be arrested, and
you\'ll likely have to sort it all out at the police station. But if
you\'re being accused of a crime, you might do well to not answer
questions, allow yourself to be arrested, and call your lawyer from the
police station.]{.rendered_qtext}
