**What are the statute of limitations on the emergency room medical bill
in Colorado?**

Since the "emergency room medical bill" is not a crime that you might
charge someone else with, a medical bill does not have a statute of
limitations.

You will be billed for your stay in the emergency room. They will check
to see if you have insurance and if you do, they will bill your
insurance. Anything not paid by your insurance (or covered in the
insurance agreement) becomes your responsibility.

If you don't have insurance (or for the remainder of the costs after
insurance), you will be billed directly. The hospital may see if you are
eligible for federal or state assistance (like Medicare) and if you are,
they will put you in for that coverage and attempt to extract payment in
that way. If you don't pay, your bill goes to a collections agency, and
your credit will receive a negative mark for a delinquent bill.
