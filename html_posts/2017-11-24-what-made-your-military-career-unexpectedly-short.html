**What made your military career unexpectedly short?**

***Multiple Sclerosis.***

The memory issues I had at the beginning of my disease impacted my
ability to pass the required PME (professional military education)
courses in time, and I hit high year of tenure and was discharged. Three
months later, I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis.

So now, I'm a disabled veteran, receiving benefits from the Veteran's
Administration, for my service-connected disability. But because they
can't prove that my memory issues caused the PME failures, there will be
no medical retirement for me. Just a pat on the back and a "good luck in
your future...disease management."
