**Americans who think universal healthcare is not feasible...Why?**

1.  Healthcare is not a right, nor is it a privilege. Healthcare is a
    **business transaction.** People train to become practitioners of
    healthcare so that they can run businesses to make money. Yes, they
    are also noble and want to help people, but primarily they are
    service providers, providing a service. You simply cannot turn a
    service into a right by changing who pays and how. All you're doing
    is taking from the people who can pay and paying for the healthcare
    of the people who don't. Plus, you're adding additional patients to
    the existing healthcare recipients, and demanding the same amount of
    money? No, you'll have to demand more money to cover the new people,
    which means that overall, it will cost more. Since all you've done
    (initially) is to change who pays and how, the cost will necessarily
    go up. You can't force doctors to provide their services for free,
    since that's slavery (which is pretty much illegal everywhere in the
    United States). Therefore, healthcare will never be a right until
    you change how you pay doctors for their services and how those
    doctors pay for medical school.\

2.  The government is not the agency to do it. Our federal government
    already runs three single-payer healthcare systems: Medicare, the
    Veterans Health Administration, and the Indian Health Service. Each
    one of these programs is an unmitigated disaster, rife with fraud,
    waste, and abuse. Veterans *literally die* waiting for healthcare.
    Why would we think that entrusting *more* responsibility to the
    government, which has already shown that it can't handle the
    responsibilities it has, make anything better?
3.  The history of "health insurance" in the United States started off
    innocuously enough, but scope creep turned it into an agency which
    does all of the payments for all health-related procedures, unlike
    insurance at all. It's really nothing more than an overpriced
    prepayment plan where no one cares about how much anything costs,
    and the people making up the prices know this, and don't mind
    tacking on a few hundred dollars here and there since no one cares.
    Healthcare consumers not only don't care how much healthcare
    procedures cost, but they don't know, since doctors and hospitals
    are not required to show you the actual cost of procedures. Changing
    who pays and how won't correct this little hiccup in the system. If
    you're interested in learning the history of our health insurance
    system in the United States, and how we got where we are, [[this

    Gordon, the author of *An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of
    American Economic Power*, among other great reads, illustrates how
    we got here and why.

I think we're just not yet in a place where we can spend 2/3 of our GDP
on Medicare for all when we can barely pay for the obligations we
currently have. By 2021, the *interest on our national debt* will cost
us more than what we spend on the entire military. By 2023, that
interest will cost us more than ***all Federal spending combined***.

I think we have bigger problems right now than who pays for whose
healthcare.
