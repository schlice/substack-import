**To all true American\'s who will YOU call president, Trump, Biden,
Sanders or other?**

Depends on who you consider a "true American." To me, that's someone who
holds firmly to the principles of the Constitution. No matter your
political party, your affiliation, or any other subgroup with which you
identify, if you are American, it's because you believe in the
Constitution.

And according to the Constitution, a peaceful transition of power took
place on January 20th, just as it has for several hundred years now
between at least 45 different people.

Therefore, **a "true American" (in my view) calls Biden the President.**

And election issues are not new to Biden, Trump, or anyone for that
matter. Elections have been called questionable many times. Remember the
2000 election? That was the most "questionable" of any recent election,
as it was essentially decided by the courts. I am certain that the
SCOTUS learned their lesson well from 2000, and some of their refusal to
hear election-related cases is still due to the sting of the backlash
from the judiciary stepping in to a political process during that
election.
