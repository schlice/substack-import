**Content:** [So your thought here is that if we ban open carry, then
the police would have responded to a MWG call (man with a gun) and they
would have stopped him.\
\
I agree with you on principle. In the city, there is really no reason
you need to be carrying a rifle. In my humble opinion, anyone carrying a
rifle is fishing for attention.\
\
But what about someone safely carrying a pistol in a holster on his/her
belt? (Yes, in Costco, I saw a woman with a shopping cart, three kids in
her cart, and a pistol on her hip). Clearly, they\'re not aiming to hurt
anyone, they are just carrying for self-defense. Should we disarm them
as well? Or should we simply get rid of open carry altogether and make
everyone carry concealed?\
\
The issue the Colorado legislature was attacking by allowing open carry
is twofold.\
]{.rendered_qtext}

1.  The state is very large, and not every portion of the state is
    covered by a city. Cities are blotches on the state map. The rest of
    the area is covered by farms and ranches. Should we force ranchers
    and farmers to leave their rifles and pistols at home, which they
    rightly use for protection while out on their acerage?
2.  The state is a \"shall issue\" state when it comes to concealed
    weapons. While it may not be terribly expensive (all things
    considered) to get a concealed weapons permit, you do have to attend
    (and pay for) your own training classes, you have to pay for
    background checks, and you have to pay adminisrtative costs.
    Altogether, starting from scratch, assuming you get good training
    and not just \"hunter safety\" (which still qualifies in El Paso
    County), we\'re talking over \$300 to get your permit, which is, in
    many cases, more expensive than the actual gun itself. Plus, there
    are annual administrative fees to keep your permit. You\'ve now
    limited concealed carry to the \"rich.\" Whether or not you believe
    that people who can afford a permit are \"rich,\" you\'ve
    essentially ostracized an entire class of citizens: people who
    can\'t afford a permit. What if they received a gun as a gift? Or as
    a family heirloom? If they can\'t afford the training and licensing
    fees, they can\'t conceal a firearm.

Denver successfully fought and won the right to override the state
open-carry ruling; in the city of Denver, you cannot open-carry, even
though the state allows it. Colorado Springs could easily do the same
thing, if they choose. The question remains: does the Mayor and City
Council believe that there is enough support for such a measure? If they
do, perhaps they will propose it.
