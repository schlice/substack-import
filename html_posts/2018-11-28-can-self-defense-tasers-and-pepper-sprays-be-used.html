**Can self-defense tasers and pepper sprays be used against in a
non-lethal but physical threat? What about the defensive display of a
firearm or a warning shot?**

I'll go through each of these, in order. This applies to the vast
majority of US states, but not all. It would be challenging to go
through each state's laws, so I am providing a general summary for the
US. In other words, your mileage may vary, check your states laws, this
is not a law brief, and I am not your lawyer.

**Non-lethal but physical threat:** In most states, this is not a thing.
A threat is not classified by its lethality. It is classified based on
*your perception* as to whether or not the threat poses a risk to your
life, or is a risk that could cause you grave bodily injury. This is
injury that could result in the permanent loss of a bodily function or
use of an appendage. For example, if you get hit so hard in the face
that your orbital socket is broken, you risk losing your eyesight in
that eye. This would be considered "grave bodily injury."

Threats of death or grave bodily injury almost universally can be met
with any level of force you choose, up to and including lethal force.

But we're talking about non-lethal force and whether or not it can be
used. Again, whether or not you can carry and/or use any of these tools
is entirely up to the state you are in. As I said before, check your
local and state laws before you carry a pepper spray, a civilian Taser,
or a firearm.

**Pepper spray:** In the vast majority of states, pepper spray can be
carried and used against any kind of physical threat. Remember that it
is a *defensive* tool and cannot be used *offensively*. It cannot be
used as a "preemptive first strike" tool, either. It is a defensive tool
only.

**Tasers:** In the majority of states (but not all), Tasers are not
considered lethal weapons and do not require permits to carry. The law
is much more fuzzy on the carry of Tasers than it is on the carry of
pepper spray. Taser International has a [[great
chart](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=188a95&url=https://buy.taser.com/pages/state-requirements){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="taser.com"}]{.qlink_container} on their website which shows
the state of carry laws for Tasers across the country.

The Taser is *extremely effective* against physical threats. In many
cases, you can set the Taser to continuously cycle so that you can put
it down, let it keep doing its thing, and you can get away. The idea
here is that you would deploy the Taser, set it for continuous cycling,
put it down, and proceed immediately to the nearest police station. You
should also know that if you file a police report indicating you did
this, and you send a copy of the report to Taser, they will send you a
replacement unit (assuming you bought the original unit from Taser).

**Firearms:** As you are probably aware, carry laws and concealment laws
are much tighter for firearms than they are for Tasers or pepper spray.
In almost all states, you need a permit to conceal a firearm. In many
states, you need a permit to openly carry a firearm, and in some states,
you cannot do either. This is an area where you *must* check your local
laws before proceeding. A quick stop at your local firearms store will
net you all the information you need on carry laws and what you need to
do in order to stay legal.

- **Defensive Display**: Defensive display of a firearm occurs many
  times a year in the United States, and thwarts most criminal activity
  without a shot ever being fired. Accurate statistics about how often
  this occurs are not available, as in most cases, the crime was stopped
  before it started, so the police were not contacted. You should also
  know that there is a fine line between "defensive display" and
  "brandishing a firearm." Most states do not have "defensive display"
  or "defensive draw" laws, and in most cases, displaying your firearm
  in this way in most states constitutes *you* committing an assault.
  However, if you were in fear for your life, or in fear of grave bodily
  harm (as the question states), it's highly unlikely that you would be
  charged for your assault, as it was in self-defense, and it probably
  wouldn't be a "criminal assault." Especially if you simply gripped
  your firearm, displayed your grip, but it remained in the holster. In
  many states, this would obviate a "brandishing" charge, but not the
  assault. Depending on the state, you could be charged with criminal
  menacing, but again, you have a defense.
- **Warning shots:** *NEVER, NEVER, NEVER DO THIS.* When you take
  firearms classes, you'll learn that you only actually fire your weapon
  to neutralize a threat. You don't fire your weapon to "send a signal"
  unless you're lost in the wilderness and you're calling for help. The
  mere mention of warning shots tells me that you need some firearms
  training before you even think about carrying a firearm in public. If
  "defensive display" can get you in a world of trouble, imagine just
  how much more trouble you can get into for firing your weapon at
  something that was *not* your intended target.\
  \
  Just scrub that idea from your mind right now. No warning shots. No,
  no, no, no.

This was not an exhaustive list, and it is not applicable across all
states. All states vary in their laws, and your mileage may vary, check
your state laws before proceeding, and please be safe.
