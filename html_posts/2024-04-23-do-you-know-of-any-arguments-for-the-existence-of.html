The Kalam Cosmological Argument does not require faith. It is not an
argument from ignorance (or a "god of the gaps" fallacy), and it
certainly does not require imagination to believe it.

Let's review quickly the argument:

- P1: Everything which has a beginning has a cause.
- P2: The universe had a beginning.
- C1: The universe has a cause.

So let's dig in to these two premises and one conclusion:

**Premise 1:** This statement says everything that has a beginning has a
cause. It's very important that we get this right. Some atheists try to
refute this premise by responding, "But if everything that exists has a
cause, and God exists, then what caused God?" But the premise does not
claim, "Everything that *exists* has a cause." It says, "Everything that
*begins to exist* has a cause." Since God, by definition, and whether
you believe in Him or not, is eternal and never began to exist, this
first premise does not apply to Him. Therefore, the rhetorical question
"What caused God?" is like asking, "To whom is the bachelor married?" or
"What is the sound of one hand clapping?" Regardless of whether
bachelors or hands exist, these questions do not make sense. They are
literally nonsense because they confuse the meaning of terms.

Now that we have cleared away that misunderstanding, let us turn back to
the first premise. Is it true? Does everything that begins to exist have
a cause? For most people, the answer is yes; it is common sense. Almost
nobody denies it. The statement simply means that nothing just springs
into existence, randomly and without a cause. For if things did come
into being this way, then our world would be a wild spree of things
apparently popping into existence like sleight of hand magic. Only it
would be worse, since with sleight of hand you at least have a magician
who pulls rabbits out of a hat. However, in a world that violates this
first premise, rabbits would pop in and out of being even without
magicians or hats. Few sane people believe the world works this way.
Even the great atheist David Hume said, "I never asserted so absurd a
proposition as that something should arise without a cause." So, through
experience and reflection most people, even most honest atheists, agree
that everything that begins to exist has a cause.

**Premise 2:** This claim is slightly more controversial than the first
one. In fact, no less a thinker than St. Thomas Aquinas says that the
truth that the world had a beginning of its duration is only
conclusively known by faith and not by reason. Nonetheless, a host of
the greatest minds from antiquity to the present, including St.
Bonaventure in the Middle Ages and William Lane Craig today, offer
arguments that purport to defend this truth. An example of one of these
arguments, one which St. Bonaventure includes in his paradoxes of the
infinite, goes as follows: If the world has always existed, then there
would be an infinite number of past days. However, if there were an
infinite number of past days, we never would have been able to arrive at
the present day because an infinite series, by definition, cannot be
traversed. Since we have arrived at today (and today is the end date of
history), it follows that there must have been a beginning of time (a
beginning date).

Modern physics also seems to give weight to this position. Despite
cyclic cosmological models advanced by some physicists in recent years,
since the advent of the big bang theory in the twentieth century, the
scientific consensus is that the universe did have a beginning roughly
fourteen billion years ago. Alexander Vilenkin, a leading non-Christian
cosmologist, was invited to speak at a colloquium for Stephen Hawking's
seventieth birthday. There, in front of the greatest scientists in the
world, Vilenkin said, "All the evidence we have says that the universe
had a beginning." It is rare for scientists to speak with this measure
of conclusiveness, but Vilenkin stated his opinion that it is not just
that *some* of the evidence points to a beginning of the universe, or
even the *majority* of evidence, but that *all* of the evidence points
that way today.

**Conclusion**: The two premises are widely accepted today: everything
that begins to exist has a cause, and the universe began to exist. If
that is the case, then the third statement, the conclusion of the
argument, logically follows. We cannot avoid the fact that if everything
that begins to exist has a cause, and the universe began to exist, then
the universe must have had a cause.

This logical conclusion leads us to wonder: if the universe had a cause,
*what* is that cause? The cause certainly could not have been anything
*within* the universe or even *the universe itself*, since things can't
cause themselves to come into existence. This idea defies logic. Thus,
the cause of the universe must be something *beyond* the universe,
something beyond all matter, energy, space, and time. In other words, it
must be transcendent (beyond the universe), it must be immaterial
(beyond matter and space), it must be eternal (beyond time), and if it
has created something so massively complex as the universe, it must be
tremendously powerful and intelligent. Well, a transcendent, immaterial,
eternal, supremely powerful, and intelligent cause of the
universe---what does that sound like to you? As Thomas Aquinas pithily
puts it, "This is what most people mean by 'God.'"

Now of course, this doesn't tell us anything about *which* God exists,
or anything about that God. It simply is a logical proof which shows
that logically-speaking, a creator God must exist.
