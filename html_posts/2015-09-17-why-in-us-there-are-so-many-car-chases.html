As others have said, it happens in the movies and on TV because that
sells movies and gets people to tune in to your network.\

In reality, car chases are far less frequent these days. Officers are
more likely to take the registration of the vehicle and break off the
chase and find the car later using good old fashioned police work.
Chases have to be authorized by the patrol sergeant, and increasingly,
officers are told to break off, in the interest of public
safety.]{.rendered_qtext}
