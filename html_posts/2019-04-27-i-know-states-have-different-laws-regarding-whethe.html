**I know states have different laws regarding whether or not they can
even use unmarked cars to pull over people for traffic violations, but
where it is allowed, what should you do if an unmarked car flashes
lights for you to pull over at night?**

First of all, there is no law which allows you to ignore the commands of
a police officer, even if you feel scared or threatened or unsafe. Just
know that if you are being stopped by a real officer and you do refuse
to stop, you could legally face a "failure to stop" charge, in addition
to the reason the officer was stopping you in the first place.

However, in some states, especially where unmarked cars are used, it has
been recommended that if you feel unsafe stopping, you are to slow down,
move towards the right shoulder, turn on your hazards, and call 911
immediately. The 911 operator will confirm whether or not the officer is
real. If he is, **you must stop immediately, despite your fear.**
Failing to stop at that point will most certainly get you arrested and
charged.

If you cannot make the call for any reason, well now you're in a pickle.
Your only real option is to drive directly to the nearest police station
and beg for forgiveness. It is questionable whether or not you'll
actually get it. But that's the risk that you run when you choose to not
stop.
