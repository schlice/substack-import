**Content:** [The takedown was excessive, in my opinion.\
\
Cops need to keep in mind, regardless of how uncooperative she was, that
she was drunk, and they could easily hurt her. Force that would normally
be used on a non-intoxicated person has to be adjusted for the
intoxicated person who doesn\'t respond in as coordinated a manner.\
\
The public also needs to understand that some people are sloppy drunks,
and some people are violent drunks. Some people get far more aggressive
when they are drunk. Drunks can\'t be left to their own devices, and
uncooperative drunks can turn violent in a heartbeat. She had been
uncooperative since their initial contact.]{.rendered_qtext}
