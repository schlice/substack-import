The last time I saw such a calculation done, they looked at each
prophecy and then looked at the probability of that prophecy coming true
in the life of a random person.

The calculation I'm referring to is by Peter Stoner in a book called
*Science Speaks*. The book, published in 1958, had a foreword by Dr.
Harold Hartzler, an officer of the American Scientific Affiliation. He
wrote that the manuscript had been carefully reviewed by a committee of
his organization and that "the mathematical analysis included is based
upon principles of probability which are thoroughly sound." He further
stated that in the opinion of the Affiliation, Professor Stoner "has
applied these principles in a proper and convincing way."

Stoner calculated the probability of just 8 Messianic prophecies being
fulfilled in the life of Jesus. As you read through these prophecies,
you will see that all estimates were calculated as conservatively as
possible.

1.  The Messiah will be born in Bethlehem (Micah 5:2).\
    \
    The average population of Bethlehem from the time of Micah to the
    time these calculations were done (1958) divided by the average
    population of the earth during the same period = 7,150/2,000,000,000
    or 2.8×[\[math\]10\^5\[/math\]]{.render_latex}.
2.  A messenger will prepare the way for the Messiah (Malachi 3:1).\
    \
    One man in how many, the world over, has had a forerunner (in this
    case, John the Baptist) to prepare his way?\
    Estimate: 1 in 1,000 or 1×[\[math\]10\^3\[/math\]]{.render_latex}.
3.  The Messiah will enter Jerusalem as a king riding on a donkey
    (Zechariah 9:9).\
    \
    One man in how many, who has entered Jerusalem as a ruler, has
    entered riding on a donkey?\
    Estimate: 1 in 100 or 1×[\[math\]10\^2\[/math\]]{.render_latex}.
4.  The Messiah will be betrayed by a friend and suffer wounds in His
    hands (Zechariah 13:6).\
    \
    One man in how many, the world over, has been betrayed by a friend,
    resulting in wounds in his hands?\
    Estimate: 1 in 1,000 or 1×[\[math\]10\^3\[/math\]]{.render_latex}.
5.  The Messiah will be betrayed for 30 pieces of silver (Zechariah
    11:12).\
    \
    Of the people who have been betrayed, one in how many has been
    betrayed for exactly 30 pieces of silver?\
    Estimate: 1 in 1,000 or 1×[\[math\]10\^3\[/math\]]{.render_latex}.
6.  The betrayal money will be used to purchase a potter's field
    (Zechariah 11:13).\
    \
    One man in how many, after receiving a bribe for the betrayal of a
    friend, has returned the money, had it refused, and then experienced
    it being used to buy a potter's field?\
    Estimate: 1 in 100,000 or 1×[\[math\]10\^5\[/math\]]{.render_latex}.
7.  The Messiah will remain silent while He is afflicted (Isaiah 53:7).\
    \
    One man in how many, when he is oppressed and afflicted, though
    innocent, will make no defense of himself?\
    Estimate: 1 in 1,000 or 1×[\[math\]10\^3\[/math\]]{.render_latex}.
8.  The Messiah will die by having His hands and feet pierced (Psalm
    22:16).\
    \
    One man in how many, since the time of David, has been crucified?\
    Estimate: 1 in 10,000 or 1×[\[math\]10\^4\[/math\]]{.render_latex}.

Multiplying all these probabilities together produces a number (rounded
off) of 1×[\[math\]10\^{28}\[/math\]]{.render_latex} . Dividing this
number by an estimate of the number of people who have lived since the
time of these prophecies (88 billion) produces a probability of all 8
prophecies being fulfilled accidently in the life of one person. That
probability is 1 in [\[math\]10\^{17}\[/math\]]{.render_latex} or 1 in
100,000,000,000,000,000.

And again, that's just *eight* of the prophecies about the Messiah in
the Old Testament coming true in the life of one man.
