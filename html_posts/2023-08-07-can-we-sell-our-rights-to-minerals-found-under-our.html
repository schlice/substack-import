The answer, as is the answer to any legal question, is "it depends."

In all states, you can buy and sell mineral rights separate from the
property at the surface. In other words, mineral rights are *severable.*
So if you own a piece of property, if you have not severed the mineral
rights, then you own any of the minerals found under your land. That
means that if there is oil, gas, coal, or minerals under your land, you
own those and can contract to mine and sell them.

Clearly, this presents some practical issues if you own a house in
suburbia, but not if you own an isolated 50-acre tract in Piedmont.

As is previously noted, you can sell the mineral rights under your land
without selling your land (commonly called a "split estate"). This was a
common practice during the Homestead times, especially in Alaska.

You would have to authorize the extraction of those minerals. If you did
not, transverse drilling has gotten really technologically sound these
days.
