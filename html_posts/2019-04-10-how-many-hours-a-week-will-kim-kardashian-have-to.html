From the linked *Vogue* article, which I read so you don't have to:

> You might be wondering: How does someone study law if they haven't

**Kim must do 18 hours a week of supervised study,** which she is
currently doing with lawyers Jessica Jackson and Erin Haney, as part of
a four year apprenticeship with their law firm. Sometime this summer,
she'll take what's known as the "mini bar," which if she passes will be
enough to allow her to continue her studies.

She will continue with this apprenticeship, and hopefully take the bar
in 2022.

California is one of four states which allows people to apprentice
instead of attending law school.

*(edited, as the linked Vogue article is pretty scant on details. Needed
CNN and some others to clarify the specifics about CA's alternate bar
procedures).*
