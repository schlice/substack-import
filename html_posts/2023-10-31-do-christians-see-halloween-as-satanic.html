Some Christians do.

Some Christians see any form of participation in Halloween activities as
sinful because they believe that Halloween is a satanic holiday
established to worship evil spirits and promote darkness and wickedness.

Some Christians participate in Halloween simply by dressing up in a
costume and having fun, seeing it as innocent and harmless.

*So who is right?*

- Is there anything evil about a Christian dressing up in an innocent
  costume and going around the block asking for candy? *No, there is
  not.*
- Are there things about Halloween that are anti-Christian and should be
  completely avoided? *Absolutely!*

Since the Bible does not talk specifically about Halloween, if parents
are going to allow their children to participate, they should make sure
to keep them from getting involved in the darker aspects of the day. If
Christians are going to take part in Halloween, their attitude, dress,
and most importantly, their behavior, should still reflect a redeemed
life ([[Philippians
1:27](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=aac073&url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search%3DPhilippians%25201%253A27%26version%3DNIV){.external_link

churches that hold \"harvest festivals\" and incorporate costumes, but
in a godly environment. There are many Christians who hand out tracts
that share the gospel along with the Halloween candy.

In my last church in Colorado Springs, our "Trunk or Treat" festival;
where church members decorated the "trunks" of their cars, played games,
and passed out candy; was our largest community outreach event of the
year. And in Colorado Springs, surveys routinely pegged the percentage
of the population that was unchurched at 50%. So when parents became
concerned about dangerous neighborhoods and letting their children
wander the streets at night, they would come to our event. They'd also
get to hear about the other great children's programs we offered (as
well as the adult programs).

Ultimately, the decision whether or not to participate in Halloween
activities belongs to the individual believer, in the spirit of
[[Christian
