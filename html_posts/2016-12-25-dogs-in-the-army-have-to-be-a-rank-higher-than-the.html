We\'ll call this a hypothetical question since you assume many things
which are incorrect.

- Dogs do not have rank. They are "assets," not \"personnel." Assets are
  unranked. They may receive honorary rank, but nothing official.
- Officers are not dog handlers (sadly, because I would have loved to be
  a dog handler).
- But even if they were, generals would not be in a job which required
  handling a dog. General officer level leadership positions drive the
  ship, they don\'t operate the throttle.
