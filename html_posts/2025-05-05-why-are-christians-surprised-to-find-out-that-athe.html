Atheists would not be "members" of the church. They may attend, listen
to the music and the message, enjoy some free coffee and donuts, spend
some time with some truly wonderful and kind people, but they cannot be
"members" because they do not share the church's beliefs.

Membership in a Christian church is not automatic. It is not something
you inherit from your family. **Membership involves an affirmative,
personal step, which includes assenting to a belief statement.** That
means they sign a document which states that they believe in the same
things the church believes. There's nothing wrong with this, either.
Anyone is welcome to attend, but only those who believe as the church
does will be admitted as *members*. The atheist may attend as often as
he likes as a *guest*, but won't be a *member*.

So yes, a Christian would be surprised to find an atheist as a member,
because they would have had to sign the belief statement under false
pretenses, and it simply doesn't make sense for an atheist to join a
church as a member when the atheist affirmatively doesn't believe
anything the church does.

(EDIT) Sometimes, when you answer a question, it takes the comments to
steer the conversation in a particular direction.

So it seems that when some people read this question, they believe that
some atheists joined the church as children, no longer believe, but
continue to attend church because it would be embarrassing personally to
leave the church, and may even cost them friendships. One commenter said
that a person admitting he no longer believed "could get threats, be
shunned, lose all his friends, even job and family might be on the
line."

I don't know the culture of religion around the world. If you live in a
culture where you are shunned for having a belief which is not shared by
others, I feel for you. That must be a terrible way to live.

I can't speak to those issues. I can only speak to Christianity in the
United States. If such a person were here, present in the US, I would
recommend they talk to their pastor about their concerns. But I can
understand that some people may feel uncomfortable doing that. You are
welcome to live your life in whatever way you choose, including
attending a church whose beliefs you affirmatively reject. I suppose you
can just think of it as a cool social club with coffee and donuts. I
would recommend not telling anyone that you don't believe. You wouldn't
want to out yourself, and you wouldn't want to dissuade anyone else from
their belief, would you?

So I guess if you're a closeted atheist, you should stay in the closet.
But do keep going. Maybe you'll hear something that may change your
mind.

(EDIT 2) So can you join a church and not be a believer? Of course you
can! Either you do so intentionally, knowing that you are not a
believer, or you do so unintentionally, *thinking* that you are a
believer but you are not.

What the comments section is telling me is that people do this
unintentionally. They join the church, but then they stop loving God.

The Bible tells us that for believers, *this does not happen.* The Bible
says that when you are saved, God changes you. He replaces your heart of
stone with a heart of flesh. Right, we knew that. It's a process called
*regeneration*. In fact, **no one comes to God unless God has**
***already*** **done that work in him.**

> *No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him. And I
> will raise him up on the last day. \-- John 6:44 ESV*

Also, we see it in Ephesians 2, although more subtly:

> *And you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once
> walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of
> the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of
> disobedience---among whom we all once lived in the passions of our
> flesh, carrying out the desires of the flesh and the mind, and were by
> nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. \-- Ephesians
> 2:1--3 ESV*

See that? You were **dead** in your sins. Can you save yourself if you
are already dead? No, you can't.

So God regenerates you, gives you a new heart. Salvation includes \"the
washing of regeneration.\" This refers to the spiritual cleansing which
takes place when a person accepts Christ in salvation. At that moment, a
person\'s life is \"regenerated,\" or \"made new.\" The Holy Spirit
renews our lives when we come to faith in Christ.

Awesome. *But crucially, this new heart is only capable of loving God.
It is incapable of not loving God.*

So if a "believer" "falls away" from loving God, *were they ever really
regenerated in the first place?*

This is a valid question. Can someone who has been saved "fall out of
love" for God?

If you believe the Bible, the answer is no.
