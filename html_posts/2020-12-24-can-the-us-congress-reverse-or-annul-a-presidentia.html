Sure, if you can prove that the president didn\'t issue it.

The White House has an Office of Pardons. Let\'s say the Director of
that office sends a memo to a prison stating that the President has
pardoned a certain prisoner and to release that inmate immediately.

That\'s an illegal pardon.

But if the President pardons someone, it is never illegal. The pardon
power is enumerated in the Constitution, so exercising it is *de facto*
Constitutional. There is no case in which the President can issue a
pardon illegally.
