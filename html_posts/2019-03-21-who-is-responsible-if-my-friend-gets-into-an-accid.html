**Who is responsible if my friend gets into an accident with my
uninsured car?**

You are. All of it. You're responsible for any damage your car caused to
anything or anyone else, and you're responsible for paying for your
friend's injuries. Of course, your car is damaged, and you'll probably
have to get that fixed (which you'll have to pay for as well).

You are 100% responsible for all of those costs, because you own the
car. Oh, and by the way, you'll also be responsible for the fines you'll
face for having an uninsured vehicle on the road, which violates state
law in nearly every state. At a minimum, you are required to carry
liability insurance for injuries and property damage. Insurance which
covers the actual car itself is not usually required.

In some states, you can pay a fee instead of carrying insurance. And in
states like Mississippi and New Hampshire, you can put down a cash bond
in lieu of carrying liability insurance. In all other states, liability
insurance is mandatory.

If you think your friend should be responsible for some of those costs,
you'll have to file a lawsuit to recoup your costs. For example, if your
friend was driving recklessly, you'll have to sue him to get your money
back, after you pay for all the damage he caused.
