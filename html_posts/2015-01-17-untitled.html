suppressed, but because it is **wrong.**\
\
The study called 5,000 people and then used the results to extrapolate
over 2 million defensive gun uses. This hardly constitutes a valid
study. Basing your opinion on that study is simply wrong. Assuming that
defensive gun uses are rare based on the results of that study is also
wrong.\
\
There are over 1 million defensive gun uses annually in the U.S. Most
will go unreported. Most will conclude without a single shot being
fired. Simply the presence of a gun will stop many crimes before they
happen.\
\
Beyond guns, many crimes are less violent and less deadly simply because
a civilian decided to act and not just cower in a corner and wait for
the cops to show up (I\'ll post that study later, I\'m not at my
PC).]{.rendered_qtext}
