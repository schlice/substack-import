**After an abusive relationship, I met someone else & we really hit it
off. His ex arrives back on the scene & he says she broke it off as
trust had broken down. He feels he owes it to himself to see where it
can go. Can it really work out with them?**

*Really* work out? Like forever?

Anything can happen. But how likely is it to *actually* happen*? Not
very likely.*

I can tell you from personal experience. Once trust is gone, it is
**incredibly** hard to get it back.

They may say they want to work it out, they may say they want to try
again, but deep down inside, there will always be trust issues between
them.

Maybe they\'re the kinds of people that can get past their trust issues.
Some people can. But not everyone. And many people will forever retain
the scars of broken trust.

The only way to be able to truly trust someone again is to start over.
With someone else.

So can it work? Yes, it can work, for the right kinds of people. But for
the vast majority of us, broken trust will never heal completely. We
just learn to live with it.
