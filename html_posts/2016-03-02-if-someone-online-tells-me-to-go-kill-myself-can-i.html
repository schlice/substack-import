In the US, there is no federal law against bullying. If the bullying
behavior is directed at a person\'s race, color, religion, national
origin or sex, bullying behavior overlaps harassment laws and if it
happened at school, the school would be required to step in and deal
with it.

At a state level, all states except Montana have passed some form of
anti-bullying law. Most of the state laws relate specifically to
bullying and school, so this may not be applicable. In some states like
New York, the bullying behavior can take place outside of school so long
as it is feasible that the behavior would impact the academic
environment.

If the bullying involves electronic media (SMS messages, Facebook, etc),
it is called \"cyberbullying.\" There are, as of yet, no federal or
state laws against this.

Basically, there aren\'t any laws against being a jerk. In fact, their
right to say hurtful things is protected by the Constitution. Your
friend needs to get help for her depression and needs to develop some
healthy boundaries and learn some coping strategies for dealing with
mean people. News flash: they\'re going to be there for the rest of your
life. And you can\'t change them. You can only change ***how you react
to them***. Stand in one spot and draw a circle around your feet. You
can change everything inside the circle. You can\'t change anything
outside the circle.

Remember: all the water in the ocean can\'t sink a ship unless the water
gets inside the ship. Similarly, all the negativity of the world can\'t
get to you unless you allow it inside you.

The key is learning how to keep it outside. That\'s where she needs
help.

If this is happening at school, you need to report it to school
administration, immediately. Schools are required to deal with bullying
behavior. If, as I suspect, this is happening outside of school, help
your friend get help. Sit down with her and her parents/guardians and
help them understand that she needs help. That\'s the best you can do.
