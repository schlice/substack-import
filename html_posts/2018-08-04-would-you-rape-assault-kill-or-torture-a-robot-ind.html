**Would you rape, assault, kill, or torture a robot indulgently since it
does not have rights?**

Ah, so I see you've been watching
[[*Westworld*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9ef183&url=https://www.hbo.com/westworld){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="hbo.com"}]{.qlink_container} then, have you? I'm on to
Season 2.

*Westworld* is a series on HBO which delves into this very question. It
explores a future fantasy theme park, where "hosts" (robots) exist in an
Old West re-creation. "Guests" can do whatever they like with the
"hosts," including raping, assaulting, and "killing" the robots (who go
offline when they are shot), only to have their memories wiped and be
reset for the next round of guests. The guests cannot be killed by the
weapons in the park, so they can live out their fantasies, as either a
"white knight" or a "black hat." When one character (William, played by
[[Jimmi
Simpson](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ee20e1&url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0801051/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="imdb.com"}]{.qlink_container}) enters the park for the first
time, he is actually confronted with the physical choice in color of
hat, not too subtly offering him the choice to either be a "good guy" or
a "bad guy."

If you haven't seen the show, I won't ruin it for you.

At any rate, the show explores the idea that you *can* do these things
with robots because they are specifically *not* human. The show also
explores when "life" begins and what it means to be alive. *Can* you
violate the *rights* of a non-sentient creature? Does a robot have
rights? Legally, since a robot is not "alive," you cannot violate its
rights, even if it is an expensive, complex, humanoid robot. It cannot
be raped or tortured, because those are crimes against *people*. You can
no more rape a robot than you can rape a bar stool.

Now, to the question. Would ***I*** rape or torture or kill a robot
simply because it does not have rights? I don't think so. It's not "fun"
for me to rape or torture or kill, and I wouldn't role-play it with a
robot simply because I could get away with it because it's not illegal.
That's like saying that the only reason I don't rape, torture or kill
today is because it's illegal. Like the only thing stopping me from
doing it to a *human* is the law. Thankfully, my moral compass is
slightly more evolved than that. I'm certain that there are people out
there who would, and who are only deterred by the existence of the law.
But I am not one of them.
