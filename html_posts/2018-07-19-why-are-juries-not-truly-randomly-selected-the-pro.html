**Why are juries not truly randomly selected? The process of voir dire
seems unfair to me. How can you be judged by a jury of your own peers
when a lawyer with more experience at jury selection than the other one
can stack the jury in their favor?**

You can't stack a jury because you can't pick who is going to be on the
jury. You can only exclude potential jurors, and you only have a limited
number of exclusions you can make.

Voir dire is a process to *reject* seated jurors, either using a
peremptory challenge (one which does not state a reason) or a challenge
for cause (one which the attorney states a specific reason why a juror
would not be able to reach a fair and impartial conclusion). It's not a
process by which you can *add* jurors of your choosing to the jury.

Each side has a certain number of peremptory challenges (depending on
the type of trial and the severity of the charge), and an unlimited
number of challenges for cause.

Lawyers must be careful not to remove jurors just because they are
members of a "cognizable group," or the possibility of a *Batson
Challenge* presents itself. The name comes from [[Batson v.
Kentucky](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8298ae&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batson_v._Kentucky){.external_link

defendant argued that the result was invalid because jury selection
excluded a "cognizable group."
