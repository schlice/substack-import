Not in the United States.

Here, we have freedom of choice. We are allowed to choose medical
treatment which, between us and our doctors in private,
legally-protected conversations, are best for us. We are not mandated to
accept medical procedures which we do not want, regardless of future
disease which may result from that decision.

Should we say that all vapers who suffer lung cancer which we only learn
of 50 years from now only be given palliative care? If it\'s good enough
for a vaccine, it\'s good enough for all life choices which result in
bodily harm in the future. Remember, prevention for a disease also
involves changing your personal behaviors.

Original question:

Should a law exist that requires that a person who refuses prevention
for a disease also can only be given palliative care for that disease?
