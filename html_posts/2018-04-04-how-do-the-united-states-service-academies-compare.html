**How do the United States service academies compare to Ivy League
schools academically?**

Interestingly, US News and World Reports does an annual assessment and
ranking of public undergraduate liberal arts colleges. The *Military
Times* newspaper discussed this year's rankings with an emphasis on our
military service academies:

So compared to the Ivy Leagues, military academies simply don't compare,
because they don't offer higher degrees than Bachelor's degrees.

But considering the magnitude of the additional training received at a
military academy, and the fact that besides the military academies, no
school ranked ahead of USAFA in the list has an annual tuition under
\$47,900 (service academy cadets are paid for by US tax dollars), I
think the ranking is not only respectable, but actually quite good for
what we pay.
