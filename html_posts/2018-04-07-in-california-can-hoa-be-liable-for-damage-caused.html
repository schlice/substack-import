**In California, can HOA be liable for damage caused by security to
property left (against the rules) in the common area?**

In general, a homeowner's association is not liable for the individual
actions of anyone, even their contracted security. In general, only the
security contractor would be liable for any damage to property they
cause.

The leaving of the property in a common area does not negate any
liability of any person. What it *may* do is limit the amount you may be
awarded, since the property was left in the common area in violation of
the HOA rules.

In your suit, you would have to establish that the security contractor
actually was the person who damaged the property, and then you would
have to establish that the contractor did so negligently, intentionally,
or maliciously. If you cannot establish that the security contractor
damaged the property, your case is probably over before it starts. So
hopefully you have some video evidence that shows the contractor
damaging the property. However, it is a common area, which implies that
the security contractor is not the only person with access to the area.
If anyone else has access to the common area (even if they weren't
expected to be in the area at that time), you probably haven't firmly
established that it was the security contractor who damaged the
property.

Moral of the story: don't leave your property in the common area when
you are not permitted to do so.
