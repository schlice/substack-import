**What weapons and vehicles can police officers receive under the 1033
program?**

Literally anything serviceable that the military is disposing of.

The Defense Logistics Agency helps the Department of Defense to dispose
of its \"excess property \[\...\] from air conditioners to vehicles,
clothing to computers\" by \"transfer to other federal agencies, or
donation to state and local governments and other qualified
organizations\", as well as by \"sale of surplus
property.\"[\[1\]](#GdhOK){#cite-GdhOK

> *Some of the most commonly requested items include ammunition, cold
> weather clothing, sand bags, medical supplies, sleeping bags,
> flashlights and electrical wiring. Small arms and vehicles such as

You can go to a DLA auction in your area and buy surplus military gear,
assuming you have the money. This is how military surplus stores get the
majority of their merchandise: they buy it from the military during a
DLA auction.
