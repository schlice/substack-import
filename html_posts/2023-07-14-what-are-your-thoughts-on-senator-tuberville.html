It's an interesting tactic.

Clearly, the policy he is protesting is illegal. Federal law only allows
the military to provide abortions in three very narrow circumstances:
rape, incest and threat to the life of the mother. Yet the DoD has
decided that it can rewrite Federal law with nothing more than a memo,
and allow servicemembers to travel using taxpayer funded travel to get
elective abortions, and providing paid time off to obtain such elective
abortions.

As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Tuberville
certainly has the right to oppose nominations for promotion for whatever
reason he chooses.

Most of the opposition on the Republican side of the house goes, "I
agree with what he's doing and he has the right to do it, but I wouldn't
do it that way."

But just because it's a hard-line stance and this is the hill he is
choosing to die on doesn't mean it's necessarily bad.
