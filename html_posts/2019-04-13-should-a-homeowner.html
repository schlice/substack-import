**Should a homeowner\'s association be a deal breaker when purchasing a
property? If not, how high should the fees be?**

The existence of an HOA should never be a deal breaker when purchasing a
property. Remember the purpose of an HOA: **to keep your home value as
high as possible by ensuring that what your** ***neighbors*** **do to
their houses doesn't negatively impact your home's value.**

Unless you get anxiety when someone tells you what you can and can't do
with the outside of your house, an HOA is a good thing. Here's why.

Let's say your neighbor really loves electric blue, and wants to paint
their house electric blue.

This one actually doesn't look terrible, but some houses might not look
good in electric blue, especially if all of the other houses in the
neighborhood are "earth tones." In that circumstance, the resale value
on your home would decline, as the neighborhood simply doesn't look
good. Is that fair to you?

What if your neighbor is an auto mechanic, and he loves to tinker on old
cars, and he's always got two or three cars in his driveway up on
blocks, and another with parts strewn all over the front of his
property? While it may look like heaven to your auto mechanic neighbor,
to everyone else it looks like a junkyard. Now, no one wants to move
into your neighborhood because it looks like the Beverly Hillbillies
live down the street. Is that fair to you?

What if you have a neighbor who believes in "natural living" and treats
his front yard the same way? "Let nature handle the lawn," he says.
Consequently, it looks like a weed-infested jungle. But hey, it's his
property, right? Except that no one wants to buy your house because
they'd be living next door to George of the Jungle. Then all manner of
wild animals start nesting in his jungle, and causing disease and
nuisance to your pets and affecting the safety of the children in your
neighborhood. Without an HOA, while it is doable with lawyers and code
enforcement, it's still really difficult, expensive, and time consuming
to get that neighbor to clean up his act. Is that fair to you?

HOAs ensure that what your neighbors do doesn't impact your house's
value or the safety and well-being of your neighborhood.

HOAs can provide other services as well, such as community pools,
community trash and recycling services (where it is not provided by the
city), maintained walking trails, etc.

So how much is too much? It depends on the services the HOA offers. Do
they have a community center? Does it have a pool? How elaborate is that
pool? Does it have a community exercise room? Does the community have
walking trails? Does it have a community playground? Along with
maintaining all of those properties, the HOA must also carry liability
insurance on those properties, which is yet another added cost.
Therefore, the cost of the HOA should be commensurate with the services
they offer. If they are much higher than what they actually offer, you
might reasonably think twice about buying in that neighborhood.

You can also expect condos and townhomes to have higher HOA fees than
single family neighborhoods, as they are more expensive to maintain and
also offer more services.
