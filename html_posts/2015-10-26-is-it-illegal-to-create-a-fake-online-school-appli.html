**Content:** [This walks a fine line. While it may not be *illegal* so
long as you don\'t attempt to actually use the fake account to enroll in
classes or to apply for student loans, it will almost definitely violate
the terms of service of the website, which almost alway specifies that
the information you give must not be fake.\
\
If you\'re just checking out the site, and you need an account to do
that, I would guess that it\'s probably not illegal (i.e. not something
you could be arrested for). So long as you don\'t actually use the fake
account to do anything with at all, other than look around, you will
probably be fine.]{.rendered_qtext}
