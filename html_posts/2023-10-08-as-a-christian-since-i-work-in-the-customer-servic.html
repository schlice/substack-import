Well, let's take a look at how Jesus handled rude people.

You could technically say that Jesus was, too, in the "customer service
industry," such that it was. He also dealt with rude people. So we can
look to the example of Jesus to see how to deal with rude people.

Jesus dealt with mean people in a variety of ways:

- He would rebuke them when necessary (John 8:47)
- Sometimes He would remain silent (John 8:6)
- Other times, He would ask questions (Mark 11:28--29)
- Sometimes He would point them to Scripture (Mark 10:2--3)
- He might also tell them stories (Luke 7:40--42)

When Jesus delivered the Sermon on the Mount, He was quite specific
about the fact that we must deal with difficult people in love and
humility:

> But I tell you who hear me: Love your enemies, do good to those who
> hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.
> If someone strikes you on one cheek, turn to him the other also. If
> someone takes your cloak, do not stop him from taking your tunic. Give
> to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what belongs to you, do
> not demand it back. Do to others as you would have them do to you ---
> Luke 6:27--31 ESV

We must never give back to others exactly what they give to us:

> Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult. On the contrary,
> repay evil with blessing, because to this you were called so that you
> may inherit a blessing --- 1 Peter 3:9 ESV
