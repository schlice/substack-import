I do appreciate your question, because it discusses the morality of law.

The question boils down to which came first: the morality or the law?

To that end: what is morality? The [[book
definition](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e2c452&url=https://www.google.com/search?q%3Dmorality){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="google.com"}]{.qlink_container} is "principles concerning
the distinction between right and wrong or good and bad behavior. A
particular system of values and principles of conduct, especially one
held by a specified person or society." From where do you get your
morality? Depends on your frame of reference. If you believe in God,
your morality probably stems from your beliefs. In fact, a recent report
in *Psychology Today* concluded: \"The most significant predictor of a
person\'s moral behavior may be religious commitment. People who
consider themselves very religious were least likely to report deceiving
their friends, having extramarital affairs, cheating on their expenses
accounts, or even parking illegally.\" [\[1\]](#nUrje){#cite-nUrje
.citation_link}Ultimately, what this means is that if you believe in
God, it most likely has an effect on your thinking and your behavior. If
you don't believe in a God, or in any form of higher power, your only
moral code is the one your parents defined for you, or the one you
create for yourself. In the United States, since we don't have defined
or mandatory religious practices, you only have to follow the law, you
are free to create whatever moral code you choose.

However, since you are free to have your own moral code (and we don't
have a dictatorship), whose moral code is right?

Instead, we have laws. Laws, therefore, define a base level of morality
(don't kill, don't steal, leave your neighbor alone and they will leave
you alone). These are essentially "morals," but they are a minimum level
of morality which we as a society have defined in order to live
together. This was done over many hundreds of years; ours, in fact, come
from old western European traditions: the Magna Carta, writings from Sir
William Blackstone discussing "natural law," these things influenced the
founders greatly when defining a basic set of laws founded on the morals
of the time. Surprisingly, this set of basic morals codified into law
has changed little across the more than 200 years in which it has been
in place. By the way, this answers the optional question *what do you
think are the values on which the modern western concept of justice is
founded.*

So now, with that framework, let's answer your questions.

*Do we have a moral imperative to unconditionally observe certain
fundamental human rights?* The short answer is no. In a free society,
everyone is free to define their own moral code. ***You*** may have a
moral imperative which tells you to observe some fundamental (to you)
human rights, but do we as a society have an obligation to do the same?
As a society, we are only obligated to follow the law (which, as we
learned, is a function of morality, but is a base moral guideline for
all citizens to follow). We are under no obligation to follow any other
moral code other than our own. Your moral code may hold you to a higher
standard, but even if your morality says killing is acceptable, the law
does not. This is why the law defines a base level of morality that all
citizens must follow in order to live peacefully together.

Since I answered no, the next question is *what makes something
acceptable vs. criminal?* As we have determined, our base morality was
codified into law. Therefore, the only thing that makes something
criminal is the law. Morality does not make criminality. Only law can
make an act criminal. Criminality, therefore, is a legal definition, not
a moral one.

Hope this helps.
