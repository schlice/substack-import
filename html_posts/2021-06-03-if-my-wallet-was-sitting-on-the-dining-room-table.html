*(US answer only. Be advised that parole rules vary from state to state,
so everything in this answer may not necessarily apply to you)*

Maybe your husband's parole officer didn't make this clear to you, so
let me see if I can help.

Parole is not "release from prison." It is "conditional release."

In order to ensure that parolees stay out of trouble, they must meet
with their parole officer (PO). You probably already knew that. You
probably also knew that POs do random site visits to ensure the parolee
is reintegrating into society appropriately, and that there are no
violations that could send him back to prison.

As I initially mentioned, parole is a "conditional release." Some of the
conditions that may apply to your husband as a condition of his release:

- He may have to get a job and keep it for a certain period of time
- He may have to refrain from drug and alcohol use. If part of his
  sentence was for either, he may have to attend AA or NA meetings
  regularly.
- He may have to stay within a certain geographic area unless his PO
  gives him permission
- He may not contact his victims or former associates, and he may not
  participate in any criminal activity

The PO usually can conduct random, unannounced searches of the parolee's
residence, and usually has the authority to search the areas which the
parolee has reasonable access to. This includes looking in a wallet on
the dining room table for evidence of drug or alcohol use, or for
evidence of criminal activity. POs usually have pretty broad discretion
in this regard, as your home is essentially considered an extension of
the jail, and that PO is responsible for that parolee.

If you really believe your rights were violated or that the PO did
something he was not allowed to do, you should not ask questions on
Quora. You should instead call a criminal defense attorney in your area.
You might want to contact your husband's original defense attorney, or
you may wish to find another. Your call, but one way or another, if you
really think there is a violation here, you can only be advised properly
by a lawyer.

**If my wallet was sitting on the dining room table and it was clearly
my wallet and the parole officer without asking grabs it and goes
through it is that acceptable and I\'m not on parole my husband is?**
