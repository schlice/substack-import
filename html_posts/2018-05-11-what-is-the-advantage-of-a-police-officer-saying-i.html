None.

Because if this were the case, once you subpoena the dash cam footage
from the officer\'s car and it shows no FST performed, the charge gets
tossed.

Therefore, I highly suspect that something which can be reasonably
alleged to be a FST will actually appear on that recording.

I\'d prepare for that, if I were you.
