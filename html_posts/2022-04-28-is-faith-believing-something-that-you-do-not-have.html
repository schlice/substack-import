This is a common misconception about faith, usually promulgated by
people who are not believers themselves, but sometimes from believers
who believe without *knowledge of* the good reasons behind their beliefs
(not that those reasons don't exist).

**Faith is not belief without evidence. Faith is believing what you
already know to be true,** ***even though there may be unanswered
questions remaining*.**

Let's give an example to aid in our understanding. Let's say I see a
chair. I would like to sit in the chair. *But how do I know that the
chair is going to hold my (greater than I'd prefer) weight?* I can look
at the chair, which appears sturdy. I can check to see if all the
fastening hardware is there. I can look at its design, and see if the
materials, in my experience, can support me. I can look around and see
if anyone else is sitting in a similar chair. *But I will never have a
100% guarantee that the chair will support my weight*. At a certain
point, I have no choice but to ***have faith*** in what I know, based on
the evidence I already have, and sit in the chair.

What does this example teach us? My faith in the ability of the chair to
support me is based on **good reasons** to believe it. It's based on
empirical and observational evidence, *but without direct evidence of
this chair's construction or ability to actually do what I need it to
do.* But I have faith that what I know about chairs in general, and what
I can determine about this chair in specific, will appropriately guide
me into making the correct choice. And so, I can proceed with faith that
what I know sufficiently helps me understand what I don't.

We can apply the same logic to religion as well. My religious faith is
also based on lots of empirical and observational evidence, but without
direct evidence of God's existence. At a certain point, the amount of
evidence I have must be enough to allow me to have faith that what I
believe is true.
