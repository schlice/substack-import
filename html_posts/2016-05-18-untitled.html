Think what you like, but even if actual numbers of botched no-knock
warrants have been grossly under-reported, it still doesn't rise to the
level of "often." It's rare at worst, virtually non-existent at best.

The media does a great job hyping stories that sell airtime and
newspapers. "In other news, 300,000 police officers in the United States
didn't break any laws today" doesn't sell airtime.
