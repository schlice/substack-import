It appears that everyone is glossing over the fact that in the US legal
system, you don't prove yourself innocent. The onus is on the government
to prove you are a gang member.

And "due process" for a non-citizen looks different than it does for a
citizen. Everyone receives due process, but non-citizens, for
immigration issues, receive an administrative hearing in Immigration
Court in front of an immigration judge. They can appeal (to another
immigration judge) if they believe there was an administrative error,
but barring that appeal, if they lose, their deportation process begins.
This still counts as due process, and it definitively does not indicate
that due process is "unavailable."
