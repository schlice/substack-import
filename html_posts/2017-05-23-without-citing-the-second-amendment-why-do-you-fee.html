I trained on that style of weapon during my time in the military. The
marksmanship ribbons I earned prove that I did pretty well with it. I
bought one and was able to break it down and re-assemble it by rote. I'm
comfortable carrying it, I'm comfortable sighting it in, and I'm
comfortable using it. I can put rounds downrange exactly where I want
them to be.

So why wouldn't I want to use the training I have to protect and defend
my family? Otherwise, I'd feel like that training went to waste.
