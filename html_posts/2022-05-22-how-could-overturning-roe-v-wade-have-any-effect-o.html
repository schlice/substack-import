This very question has been in the news recently. The Secretary of
State, Janet Yellen, made a statement about it in a Senate Banking
Committee hearing in May. Yellen spoke of the negative economic impacts
of limiting abortion rights in the US, saying it would set women\'s
progress back in the economy. In the hearing, she said:

> I believe that eliminating the rights of women to make decisions about
> when and whether to have children would have very damaging effects on
> the economy and would set women back
> decades.[\[1\]](#rBALn){#cite-rBALn .citation_link}

What she was probably referring to was women\'s labor force
participation rates, wages, and levels of poverty.

She's right about the fact that having a child at the wrong time can
have a deleterious effect on whether or not you end up poor, or in the
middle class. Where her logic failed is in the fact that she claims that
eliminating the right to elective abortion is akin to "removing the
choice of a woman to make decisions about when and whether to have
children."

It's well known that if you are in an unstable monetary situation and
you choose to have children, you're not setting yourself up for success.
The Brookings Institute published a study which basically said, in part,
that if you wait to have children until you're over 21, married and have
finished high school with a full time job, you have a nearly 75% chance
of joining the solidly middle class. You'll have only a 2% chance of
ending up in poverty.

They went on to say the following:

> Consider an example. Today, more than 40 percent of American children,
> including more than 70 percent of black children and 50 percent of
> Hispanic children, are born outside marriage. This unprecedented rate
> of nonmarital births, combined with the nation's high divorce rate,
> means that around half of children will spend part of their
> childhood---and for a considerable number of these all of their
> childhood --- in a single-parent family. As hard as single parents try
> to give their children a healthy home environment, children in
> female-headed families are four or more times as likely as children
> from married-couple families to live in poverty. In turn, poverty is
> associated with a wide range of negative outcomes in children,
> including school dropout and out-of-wedlock
> births.[\[2\]](#fDJTh){#cite-fDJTh .citation_link}

The problem is well known and the solution is well known. Neither the
problem, nor the solution, have anything to do with killing babies.
