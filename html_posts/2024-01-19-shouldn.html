ERROR: Question contains erroneous assumptions.

HOAs cannot force people out of their neighborhoods simply because they
don't like the homeowners.

HOAs can't even force people out of their neighborhoods *per se*. HOAs
simply want to get paid under the terms of their contract agreement. And
if you fail to pay (be it your dues or any fines you may have been
assessed), the HOA can place a lien on your house, as they have a
controlling interest in your property, which they had since before you
bought your house. And if you let it go long enough without paying, the
HOA can foreclose on your lien and sell your house out from under you in
order to be paid.

In other words, you can't fail to keep up your end of this contract
without some pretty serious consequences. The HOA *will be paid*,
whether or not you agree.

If you disagree with a fee or fine, and you've discussed it with your
HOA and they refuse to change their minds about it, your only recourse
is to hire an attorney and file a lawsuit.
