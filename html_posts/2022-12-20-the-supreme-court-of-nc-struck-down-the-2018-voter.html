title: "The Supreme Court of NC struck down the 2018 voter ID law which requires residents to present an ID before being able to vote, claiming it discriminates against the residents. Is requiring an ID to fly also unconstitutional following the same logic?"

First of all, if I were representing the lawmakers in this case, I would
immediately appeal to SCOTUS. The reason the law was ruled
unconstitutional was because it allegedly \"was motivated by a racially
discriminatory purpose.\"

Frankly, the purpose why the law was implemented is wholly irrelevant.

The fact of the matter is that it may have been \"motivated by a
racially discriminatory purpose.\" That doesn't matter.

**What matters is if it achieves its purpose.** *Is* the law *actually
racially discriminatory?* For example, the racist people may have told
their staffers, "Write me a racially discriminatory law that unfairly
targets blacks and makes sure they can't vote" *and the staffers may
have written a completely race-neutral law* that doesn't discriminate
against anyone.

**The intentions of the legislators does not matter**. What matters is
the *actual application of the law.* They may have been racially
motivated, but if the actual law, as implemented, is race-neutral and
doesn't actually unfairly target any one race, then it should not be
unlawful.

The plaintiffs in this case (Democrats) argue that such voter ID
requirements are meant to tamp down voter turnout by minorities and
others who "are more likely not to have appropriate ID" and tend to vote
for their party. But what evidence of this claim exists? Can they even
show *one person* who cannot vote because they don't have appropriate
ID? How do these alleged people function? There are so many things in
life that require appropriate ID, and yet those things are not in
question here, because only voting is political. They claim that
minorities are more likely to not have appropriate ID, which is a racist
view in and of itself. **In order to claim racism, they have to be
racist.** But there is no proof that the actual alleged events actually
occur, because they know that if they could present one such person, we
could easily provide them with a state ID, as there are many mechanisms
available to help people get ID cards at little to no cost.

If this is allowed to stand, we open the door to question the
motivations of our lawmakers when they make laws, and judge perfectly
acceptable laws as unconstitutional because the motivations of the
lawmakers is suspect.

The whole idea behind our representative system of government includes
the fact that all people are flawed and selfish. There are no perfect
people, and there are certainly no perfect legislators. What matters is
not the motivation of the legislator, but the *actual effect of the laws
they write.*

\<stepping down off of soapbox\>

Now, using the standard established in this case (the motivation of the
lawmakers determines whether or not the law is unconstitutional), if the
motivations of the lawmakers who made the laws requiring ID to fly were
found to be motivated by racism, then yes, the laws requiring ID to fly
would also be unconstitutional.

If the decision in NC is allowed to stand, I should hope that the same
group sues the Department of Homeland Security and argues that aircraft
passenger ID laws are similarly racist, as well as everything else which
requires ID (buying a gun, buying a house, buying alcohol, getting
government assistance, etc).
