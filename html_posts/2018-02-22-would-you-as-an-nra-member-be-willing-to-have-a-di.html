**Would you, as an NRA member, be willing to have a discussion with
journalists from all over the world, who cover violent crime, in the
hope of being able to come to an agreement about automatic weapons?**

Sure!

Automatic weapons have basically become very difficult to get in the
United States since 1986. They are ridiculously expensive and are
heavily regulated at the state level.

Also note that those legal, automatic weapons have **never** been used
in crime since they were heavily regulated. Criminal have used their
illegal variants many times, but the legal ones are never used in
criminal activity.

So whatever "agreement" journalists want to come to over automatic
weapons, I think we'd all agree that in the US, we've done an excellent
job of regulating automatic weapons.
