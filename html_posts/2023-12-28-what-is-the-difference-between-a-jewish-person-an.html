Depends on how you define the word "Zionist." These days, Zionism is an
ideology that supports \"the development and protection of the State of
Israel,\"[\[1\]](#WwwNy){#cite-WwwNy .citation_link}or someone who
advocates for an independent Jewish state where Jews can live safely.
Its original meaning, though, was the advocacy of establishing Jewish
control of Jerusalem, which is currently in the territory controlled by
Hamas. Zionism is used derisively today as advocation of the destruction
of the Arabs in the region.

Not all Jews live in Israel. There is a significant population of Jews
in the United States as well. Jews exist in many countries around the
world, not just Israel. But to many religious Jews, Israel is "the
promised land." However, you don't have to be a religious Jew to want to
see a country where Jews can live in safety and freedom.

Many people, especially Palestinian Arabs, don't see a difference
between "Jew" and "Zionist." The very presence of this question shows
just how much people misunderstand the difference between "Jew" and
"Zionist." Most Jews don't even live in Israel. And not all Jewish
Israelis are "settlers" or "occupiers" who want to take over more and
more Palestinian land. Some openly advocate for the "two-state solution"
where Israel and Palestine live side by side in peace.

**TL;DR:** Not everyone who is Jewish advocates for the destruction of
the Palestinian state, and not everyone who argues for the destruction
of the Palestinian state is Jewish. Judaism and Zionism are not the
same.
