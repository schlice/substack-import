1.  If you live in a community with an HOA, you will have to pay your
    dues. If you don't, they will charge you late fees on top of the
    dues you owe, and eventually they will send your account to the
    association attorney, who will place a lien on your house for the
    unpaid dues and late fees, and then will add their lawyer fees on
    top of that. When you have accumulated enough debt, they will
    foreclose on their lien, selling your house out from under you to
    pay for your debt. Short answer: don't refuse to pay your HOA dues.
2.  The other way to stop paying HOA dues is to sell your house and move
    to an area where there is no HOA.
