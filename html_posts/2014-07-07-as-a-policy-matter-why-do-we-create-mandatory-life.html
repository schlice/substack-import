**Content:** [Any time a decision like this is made, it is done so in
the public interest. So ask yourself why the public would want someone
convicted of a crime to have a permanent record. There are several
reasons why we would want this.\
\
- While past behavior is no indication of future actions, it is possible
that in the future, an investigation may need access to the wealth of
information that was previously collected during a criminal
investigation.\
- There is an entire field of research devoted to looking at statistics
and inferring patterns based on those statistics. We learn a great deal
of information from this field of study, called epidemiology. It is most
often used in healthcare, when we are unsure of the cause of the
disease. We can look at ancillary statistics about the disease, and we
can narrow our focus towards the cause of the disease using those
statistics. The same can hold true for criminal behavior, and
maintaining records can help us narrow down societal causes of aberrant
behavior, in the hopes that we can make positive changes to reduce
violence.]{.rendered_qtext}
