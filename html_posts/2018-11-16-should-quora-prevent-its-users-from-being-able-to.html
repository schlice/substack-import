**Should Quora prevent its users from being able to disallow comments to
their answers?**

No.

Despite what you all may think about the value of being able to question
someone about their answer, there is one overriding point which remains
about Quora:

**Quora is not a debate site. Quora is a question-and-answer site.**

If you don't like an answer, you are free to do several things:

- You may downvote the answer if it is a low-quality answer unsupported
  by fact. Quora's upvote system is often misunderstood; I'll get there
  later.
- If the answer is actually wrong, you can Report the answer as
  "Factually Incorrect."
- If it's merely an opinion, you are free to answer the question
  yourself, and cite your own opinion.

However, on Quora, someone asks a question, and someone answers it. As
far as *ownership* goes, when I write an answer, it's my answer. I own
the answer. If I choose to allow comments to my answer, I own the
comments on my answer as well.

In my case, if I feel a comment adds to the value of my answer, I leave
it. If I feel it is unnecessarily argumentative, doesn't add any value
to my answer, and even if I'm just not in the mood to argue, I will
absolutely delete that comment, first advising the commenter that if
he/she has a different opinion, they are more than welcome to answer the
question themselves, but I'm just not in the mood to debate.

If you think that all answers must be debated (and that all users should
be free to debate all answers), then you not only must allow all
comments, but you must also *force the original answerer to respond to
any and all criticisms on their answers*, and that's not how Quora is
designed.

The other thing that often gets misunderstood about Quora: **Quora's
upvote button is often confused with Facebook's "Like" button.**

In the era of Facebook, the Upvote button is often confused with
Facebook's "Like" button: you like things you agree with, and you see
more of them in your Feed. However, in Quora, upvotes are designed to
highlight *high-quality answers*, ***not answers with which you agree
(or "like").*** I often upvote great answers from people with whose
viewpoints I diametrically oppose. But their answers are well-sourced
and are great arguments, so I upvote them. I don't agree with them, but
I upvote them.

But back to comments on answers: *it's my answer*. The comments on my
answer are mine, and are under my control. I can even turn off comments
completely on my answers. I know of quite a few TWs who have turned off
comments completely, just because they're tired of the constant hate.
They have that right. You do not have the right to comment on someone's
answer.
