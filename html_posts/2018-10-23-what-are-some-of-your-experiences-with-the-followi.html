**What are some of your experiences with the following MS medications,
Copaxone (glatiramer acetate), Gilenya (Fingolimod), and/or Tecfidera
(dimethyl fumarate)?**

I got two out of the three: Copaxone and Gilenya.

I started my MS journey on Copaxone (the once-a-day version; they didn't
have the higher dose back then). I wasn't squeamish about needles so it
wasn't a big deal. I only used the auto injector when injecting into my
"love handle" areas and under my arms because it made one-handed
injections easier.

I never had any problems on the Copaxone. It did exactly what it claimed
to do. It slowed disease progression and prevented new lesions from
forming. Copaxone worked great, until it didn't. After being on it for
about seven years, it simply stopped working, and my disease began to
progress again. I developed new lesions in my brain and weakness on the
right side of my body, and my doctor and I agreed that this was bad
enough that it was time to switch.

I spent 18 months on Tysabri, which was also great until it wasn't, and
that's when I switched to Gilenya.

It was my first experience with an oral MS medication. It slowed my
heart rate to a worrying degree, so much so that I'd drink "rocket fuel"
(aka Diet Mountain Dew) to balance it out, which surprisingly worked
pretty well. Nevertheless, those side effects eventually subsided.
Gilenya has produced some, er, "lower GI sensitivity" in me, but since
that's not a common occurrence, no one is chalking it up to Gilenya but
me. Your mileage may vary. I'm managing it with supplements and visits
to a naturalist, and it is adequate. So far, I'm almost 5 years into
Gilenya, and it has been working very well for me. "Very well" means "no
new lesions, no active lesions, no visible disease progression." We're
calling that a win.
