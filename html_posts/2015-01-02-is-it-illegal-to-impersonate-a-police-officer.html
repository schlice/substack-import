You are protected by the First Amendment when you dress up in a police
uniform.

The minute you try to a) gain special favors, or b) try to perform the
duties of a police officer, you are impersonating a police officer and
can go to jail.

Same holds true of military impersonators. People dress up in military
uniforms all the time, and while we in the military think that\'s
disgraceful, if we believe in the Constitution, they have a right to do
it.

The minute they walk into a Starbucks and try to get a 10% military
discount on their latte, they are impersonating a military member to
attempt to receive illicit gain, and are in violation of law in all
states (it's called ***theft of service***). The point at which the
impersonation moves from protected free speech to illegality is when the
impersonator attempts to extract some gain from the impersonation, or
attempts to perform the duties of the impersonated.
