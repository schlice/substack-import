**Are non-pornographic naked child images considered child porn if they
are watched pornographically?**

The answer is no, but the full answer is more nuanced than this.

You can't make an image pornography when it is not. The definition of
child pornography is the depiction of sexually explicit conduct
involving a minor. The legal definition of "sexually explicit conduct"
does not require that an image depict a child engaging in sexual
activity. A picture of a naked child may constitute illegal child
pornography if it is "sufficiently sexually suggestive." Additionally,
the age of consent for sexual activity in a given state is irrelevant;
any depiction of a minor under 18 years of age engaging in sexually
explicit conduct is illegal.

Therefore, if an image of a naked child is "sufficiently sexually
suggestive," it is child pornography. Otherwise, it is not.

The frame of mind one uses when viewing a picture does not change the
fundamental nature of the picture. If a picture of a child is not
sufficiently sexually suggestive, it is not child pornography. How it is
viewed is irrelevant.
