**How is statutory rape illegal and immoral when it\'s not forced?**

Force is not the issue with statutory rape. ***Coercion*** is.
"Coercion" is when someone who is older convinces someone who is younger
that it is okay to have sex. Statutory rape is illegal because the
states have decided that persons under the age of consent simply do not
have the mental capacity to make the decision as to whether or not they
should engage in sexual activity, and do not have the capacity to resist
coercion.

Whether or not statutory rape is immoral is between you and your morals.
Laws do not define morality. Laws define a base set of rules we must
follow in society in order to get along together and allow for peaceful
co-existence. Morality is defined by your upbringing, your values, and
your religion (if you are religious). Sometimes, societal norms act as a
substitute for morals, but usually people form their morals while they
are children and young adults.
