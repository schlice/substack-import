30:2 is newer guidance than 15:2. The increased chest compressions is
newly mandated by the Red Cross as studies have shown that the blood
circulation through the brain is far more critical than the rescue
breaths.

There is also a new "compression-only" protocol that eliminates the
breaths altogether.

A refresher course in CPR and First Aid is probably a good idea.
