First of all, if you are in fear for your life, you can use any force,
including deadly force, to preserve your life.

The problem with a flashbang is that they are indiscriminate, and they
are not 100% harmless to people around them. You risk injuring yourself
and the other people inside your home, not to mention that a flashbang
doesn't work like it does in a video game; it does grenade-level damage
to your property. It's going to cost you so much more to throw a
flashbang than it's worth.

Actual military and LE flashbangs are considered "destructive devices"
and are not available on the commercial market. However, there are
civilian versions of flashbangs which consist of a charge in a cardboard
canister, and these are essentially classified as "pyrotechnic devices."
They are less destructive and quieter than the real thing (125 db vs 175
db) but would still be pretty convincing in a home defense scenario.

[[These flashbang grenades are legal for

TL;DR: don't use real flashbangs. Get some civilian-version ones;
they'll still do the job against the uninitiated.
