**What should I do about the baby? You were right as soon as I told him
I was blocked on everything 5 minutes later. If I don\'t want an
abortion but I don\'t want to give it up either what should I do?**

Check Google for the nearest pregnancy resource center near you and
visit them. They can help you with resources such as maternity clothes,
diapers, and parenting classes. These centers often offer to give a
"pregnancy verification" form, which you can use to enroll in prenatal
care or to apply for government assistance with medical care (e.g.,
Medicaid or the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women,
Infants, and Children)

They may also be able to assist you with contacting a family attorney
who can help you file for child support from the father (even if he has
blocked you).
