Hello, first of all as someone who also has MS-induced bladder and bowel
issues, I personally know your struggle.

Since you asked about your job, I'll start my answer with the
job-related information, and then I'll move on to the bowel/bladder
information.

**You are not required to disclose your disability to your employer if
you do not want to.** However, *if you need an accommodation to help you
accomplish the specifics of your job, you do have to ask for it.* The
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) makes it something for which you
cannot be fired, **unless** the accommodation request is unreasonable,
or is something that the business would have to invest significant money
into, or that it would significantly change the way they do business.

Now, I don't know what you do for work, but here are some potential
accommodations you can ask for which may help:

- Easy access to a restroom: Requesting to be located near a restroom or
  in a position that allows for quick and discreet bathroom breaks is a
  common and reasonable accommodation.
- Flexible bathroom breaks: Employers should be flexible about allowing
  you to take breaks as needed without fear of repercussions or stigma.
- Access to a private restroom: A private restroom can offer the space
  and privacy needed to manage your condition comfortably.
- Hands-free disposal units: Providing discreet, hands-free disposal
  bins in restrooms ensures a private and hygienic way to dispose of
  incontinence products.

You could also ask for an accommodation like these, but again, I don't
know what you do, and some of these suggestions may not necessarily
apply to you:

- Flexible work schedules or telework: Working from home or having a
  modified work schedule can help you manage your symptoms more
  effectively, especially on days when symptoms are severe.
- Part-time hours or modified work schedule: Depending on your needs,
  adjusting your work hours or schedule may be a viable option.

There may be some workstation changes you can make to help you manage
your incontinence:

- Adjustable (sit/stand) desk: An adjustable desk that allows you to
  stand instead of sitting may be helpful, as sitting can sometimes
  worsen incontinence symptoms.
- Ergonomic chair or exercise ball: Using an ergonomic chair or exercise
  ball can support posture and core strength, potentially improving
  symptoms.
- Accessible toilets and toilet seats: This addresses potential physical
  barriers in the workplace restroom.
- Toileting aids: If necessary, specific aids may be requested to
  facilitate toileting.

Finally, here's some other changes you can request from your employer,
regardless of what you do:

- Additional rests or breaks: More frequent breaks can help manage
  fatigue or other symptoms associated with your condition.
- Unpaid or paid leave: In cases of severe symptoms, hospitalization, or
  procedures, you may be able to request leave as an accommodation.
- Modified duties: Depending on your job, some duties may be modified to
  accommodate your needs.

Remember that under the ADA, employers are required to provide
***reasonable*** accommodations that enable you to perform the essential
functions of your job, as long as these accommodations do not cause
undue hardship to the business. Your employer is permitted to ask for
medical documentation to support your request for accommodation. If they
do, you'll have to get a letter from your neurologist explaining that
your bowel/bladder incontinence is incident to your MS.

And while I know it's challenging, having open communication with your
employer or HR department can help facilitate the process and ensure
your needs are met.

On the MS side, bowel and bladder incontinence is an issue which is not
only caused by MS. There are many medication products available to
control spasticity in both the bowel and the bladder. My personal
regimen would be different from yours; MS is like that. Even if we have
the same category of symptoms (i.e. bowel and bladder issues), we
experience them differently. So I can't tell you what medicines and
interventions will work best for you, but I can tell you that there is a
wealth of capability to manage these symptoms.

I strongly suggest you talk to your neurologist (and perhaps a urologist
or a gastroenterologist as recommended by your neurologist) and ask
about remediation you can take to control these symptoms.
