Oh, that one's easy.

Despite what Iran said, literally 99% of what they threw at Israel was
intercepted before it got anywhere close.

Israel retaliated, but in a very measured way, despite what they wanted,
and in a greater way than Joe Biden wanted. Israel launched a limited
couterattack with just a few attack aircraft *which never entered
Iranian airspace*, and Israel ***completely destroyed*** their launch
sites. Think about that. They threw hundreds of drones and rockets at
Israel, and they were all knocked out of the sky with no damage. In
response, just a handful of Israeli jets *completely destroyed those
launch sites* ***without ever setting foot in Iranian territory.***

The message from Israel was loud and clear: *your attack was useless,
and we can reach out and obliterate you with just a few fighter jets,
without even breaking a sweat. Don't push us.*

The limited engagement also allowed Iran to quietly deny that anything
happened, thus allowing them to "save face" in the Arab nation
community. Which, unsurprisingly, they took, and brushed the whole
unfortunate incident under the rug.

And that, as they say, is that. You won't hear anything else on it from
anyone because Iran is going to deny any retaliation ever happened, and
Israel knows just how effective they are, and no one really wants to
start World War III with direct engagement. So Iran will go back to
fighting a proxy war to keep their nose "clean" and no one's the wiser.
