**What is the likelihood that the Supreme Court will grant certiorari
and then uphold Indiana\'s ultrasound abortion law, overturning the
lower courts\' decision?**

Unlikely, even with a majority textualist SCOTUS. The Indiana law places
an undue burden on women seeking an abortion. The courts recognize this,
and correctly block the law.

That's the only thing at issue. It's not a pro-life vs. pro-choice issue
at all. It's purely an undue burden issue, which could block some women
from being legally able to get an abortion when abortion would otherwise
be legal. If a woman couldn't afford a trip to the nearest OB-GYN which
could provide the procedure, or afford the procedure on top of the
abortion, it could be a barrier to abortion, which would currently be
unconstitutional.
