So I'm trying to understand the AMAZING LEAPS OF LOGIC you make.

It seems that you're trying to say that *because* a church has been
granted the GIFT of not having to pay taxes, the church is somehow
OBLIGATED to act as a servant of the government.

AND THEN, you make the leap that the current government wishes to disarm
the law-abiding. This is the only one where there may be a nugget of
truth. The current government DOES wish to disarm the law-abiding. Only
the Second Amendment stands in their way. Pesky Second Amendment...

AND FOR YOUR FINAL DEATH-DEFYING LEAP OF LOGIC, you presume that all
government automaton-servants must shill for said government and
encourage those who listen to them to voluntarily give up their
Constitutional rights and disarm themselves, at great personal expense.

Presuming these FANTASIC logical contortions, I could see how you might
think this.

\

But I can tell you from personal experience that churches know ALL TOO
WELL that the government is not their friend. Churches, above all, know
that the government should be kept at arm's length, and anything they
want should be critically analyzed before it is acted upon.

And finally in the category of "what church pastors know" is the fact
that the FIRST AMENDMENT, which gives those churches the very right to
exist is only still in place because the SECOND AMENDMENT exists.

In other words, you only have the rights you can keep. And you can only
keep the rights you have when you can effectively defend them.

Don't hurt yourself twisting into a pretzel trying to make the one part
agree with the other.
