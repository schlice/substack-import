<h2>Answer Comment</h2>
<div>

**Content:** [You seem to imply that the terrorist is not the jihadist.
The jihadist who is a suicide bomber has to be as extreme in his
political and religious views as the terrorist, even more so because
he\'s wearing the bomb vest.\
\
I don\'t want to confuse the issue, because we\'re discussing who would
win such a war, not about whether or not it\'s right that we are using
our force projection capabilities and influencing political processes
around the world to benefit ourselves.\
\
We are a civilized nation insofar as how we treat our own citizens and
how we deal with the outside world as it is, not with how we\'d like it
to be.]{.rendered_qtext}
