There is a big difference between *voluntarily accompanying* the police
to the station, and *custodial interrogation.*

When you voluntarily accompany the police to the station, you can leave
any time you choose. You can choose to end the questioning at any time.

When you are detained or arrested, leaving is not an option. The police,
as part of custodial interrogation, must read you your Miranda rights.
That\'s one of the ways you know you are a suspect and you can\'t leave.

Once you hear that Miranda warning, it\'s in your best interest to
**stop speaking.** Get a lawyer.

Anyway, officers can choose where the best place for you to speak would
be. If the porch is not a strategically appropriate location, they can
choose to not speak there. That is the officer\'s choice. And either
inside or at the station are reasonable choices.
