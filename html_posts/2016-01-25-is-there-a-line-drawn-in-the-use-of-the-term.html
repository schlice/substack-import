Yes, in fact, there is a line drawn in the use of the term
\"disability.\" The landmark **Americans with Disabilities Act**
actually defines what a disability is. According to the ADA:

*A disability is defined as:*

- *a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more
  major life activities (sometimes referred to in the regulations as an
  "actual disability"), or*
- *a record of a physical or mental impairment that substantially
  limited a major life activity ("record of"), or*
- *when a covered entity takes an action prohibited by the ADA because
  of an actual or perceived impairment that is not both transitory and
  minor ("regarded as").*

So you can see, there are three different conditions that can define
whether or not someone is \"disabled\": If they have an actual
disability, if there is a record of a disability, or if they are
regarded as being disabled. It\'s important to note that under the law,
someone is considered disabled if they meet one or both of the first two
prongs. A person who is merely regarded as disabled, but has no actual
or recorded disability, is not entitled to accommodations.

According to the
