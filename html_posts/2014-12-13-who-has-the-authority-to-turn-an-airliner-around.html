**Content:** [An airplane is a business. Whether or not a plane makes it
to its destination on time is a function of business, not of law.
Therefore, that business can choose to operate itself in any manner it
chooses.\
\
Nevertheless, an airline ticket is a contract for carriage. The airline
is required to get you to your destination within a certain window of
time, or compensate you for your inconvenience.\
\
If a KAL exec decided to divert an aircraft, that\'s a business
decision. That company will have to deal with the ramifications of 300+
pissed off passengers and lots of compensation. But if they choose to do
it, that\'s their business.\
\
I also imagine that it would be highly unlikely that a KAL exec would be
able to divert any other than a KAL aircraft.]{.rendered_qtext}
