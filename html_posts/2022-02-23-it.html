It is true that there is a difference between law and morality, and you
cannot legislate morality. But from there, things get confusing.

At a basic level, you can say that is is immoral to break the law
because part of being a good citizen is obeying the laws, and it is a
moral good to be a good citizen and do your part to promote the general
welfare of the society in which you live.

But as you dig deeper, you may find that there may be laws which may be
immoral (to you, as morality is personal), but not illegal. Some
examples of things which may be immoral but not illegal might include
getting an abortion, or cheating on your spouse.

Conversely, some things may be moral (to you), but illegal. Some
examples of these may be underage drinking, smoking marijuana, going
through a red light if you're driving an injured person to the emergency
room (guilty, btw), or even assisting someone with suicide.

But because everyone's morality is different, we cannot rely on morality
to be the arbiter of behavior. We have to set a **baseline** for conduct
that keeps everyone safe and allows everyone to freely exercise their
rights without impinging on anyone else's free exercise of *their*
rights. That's part of the government's charter to "promote the general
welfare and secure the blessings of liberty." So it's entirely
acceptable to tell someone who has voluntarily become part of a society
that they acted "wrongly" when they knowingly violated a law, and even
to punish them for it, ***even if it was a moral good for them to do
so.***

Original question:

It\'s wrong to commit a crime. Just philosophically, wouldn\'t it be
unreasonable to expect someone who chose to commit a crime not to commit
that crime? Because he chose to commit a crime. We should ask him to be
punished and say \'you did it wrong\'?
