**While making a call in the US, what would happen if a cop passing by
overhears you say \"I\'ve killed him\"?**

Probably nothing at all.

My son says this on a daily basis. It, of course, refers to video games.

Context matters. The cop has no knowledge of the context of the
conversation, so it's very likely that absolutely nothing at all would
happen.
