**Can the president of the United States, legally, send everyone any
message he wants using the Emergency Alert System?**

In general, no.

The Emergency Alert System has been designed to be used in the event of
national emergency. Broadcasters work in cooperation with FEMA, the FCC
and NOAA to broadcast messages related to national or regional
emergencies.

The important point to remember: **the EAS is a "last-ditch" method to
get the word out if the President is unable to get to the media.** For
example, during the September 11, 2001 attacks against the United
States, the government opted not to use the EAS because the media was
fully engaged and was adequately getting the word out.

In short, so long as the President still has access to Twitter, it's
unlikely he'd be able to use the EAS.
