Interestingly, there was another article which denoted the defense
attorney's claim that Mandalay Bay's injunctive lawsuit in Federal court
was "outrageous:"

[[Bill Stein\'s answer to Is it outrageous that MGM Resorts
International has filed federal lawsuits against more than 1,000 victims
of last October's mass shooting in Las Vegas in an apparent attempt to
avoid
liability?](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-outrageous-that-MGM-Resorts-International-has-filed-federal-lawsuits-against-more-than-1-000-victims-of-last-October-s-mass-shooting-in-Las-Vegas-in-an-apparent-attempt-to-avoid-liability/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container}

Why not sue Mandalay Bay? If I was there, and they were responsible for
providing for my safety, and they didn't, so they're the ones I'm suing,
right? More often, a lawyer will name several defendants in his lawsuit,
Mandalay Bay and its parent company MGM as one of them.

However, there is a Federal statute called the [[SAFETY
Act](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ead50f&url=https://www.safetyact.gov/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="safetyact.gov"}]{.qlink_container} which limits liability of
an organization when it uses security services which have been approved
by the government and a mass casualty event happens.

Therefore, the plaintiffs who sued Mandalay Bay and its parent company
MGM simply don't have standing, since the SAFETY Act says that you
cannot sue the venue, only the provider of the approved security.

With so many lawsuits being filed by so many victims (and so many other
lawsuits announced and not yet filed), rather than sink all the money
into getting standing rulings on all of them, and in an effort to
streamline the relief process for the victims, MGM preemptively filed a
lawsuit against all of them in Federal court (since the SAFETY Act also
says that original jurisdiction is Federal) and seeks injunctive relief
to dismiss those suits under the same act.
