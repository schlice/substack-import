It depends on whether or not you want to pursue being an officer in the
Air Force.

If becoming an Air Force officer is the career path you would like, it
is much harder (but not impossible) to become an officer if you enlist.
It is possible to get into one of the commissioning sources (OTS, ROTC,
or USAFA) after enlisting, but the number of people accepted vs the
number of people applying means that it's not the easiest path to take.
If you enlist, you will likely remain an airman/NCO (Non-Commissioned
Officer) for your career. If being an Air Force NCO is the career path
you want to pursue, enlisting is your path. You'll enlist and almost
immediately go to Basic Training. From there, you'll go off to a tech
school where you will learn the skills you will need in your career
field. Then you will be deployed to an operational Air Force Base where
you will do that job.

What's the big difference between enlisting and becoming an officer?
It's more than just whether or not you salute others, or you are being
saluted. For example, officers have one career field they can pursue
that enlisted members cannot: **pilot training**. In the Air Force, only
officers fly planes. Enlisteds are flight crew members, work the flight
line, work aircraft maintenance, etc., but they don't drive the bus.
Some other differences: officers make more money. That may not be
important to you; it's just a fact. They live in nicer houses, if you're
lucky enough to get base housing. They also have advanced degrees right
out the gate. If you go ROTC, you will complete a 4-year degree before
accepting your commission into the Air Force. This means you'll start
out with a Bachelor's degree and will immediately be placed into a
leadership role. It may not be a huge one (my first shop had six
enlisted troops in it), but it's leadership. This is experience that
translates directly to the civilian world, and you're getting it from
day one.

As an enlisted member, you will be an NCO, and in time, will become a
mentor to younger enlisted members. You may even directly supervise
them. But as an officer, you are a *leader*. Whether you see it or not,
whether you believe it or not, your enlisteds will look to you for
leadership and guidance. Is that the challenge you're looking for? If it
is, perhaps the officer path is the right one.

Good luck!
