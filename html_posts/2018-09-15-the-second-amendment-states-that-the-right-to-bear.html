**The Second Amendment states that the right to bear arms is only
guaranteed as part of a well regulated militia, so why do we ignore the
militia stipulation? How did we come to interpret the amendment and
ignore part of it?**

Why do you ignore the second statement in favor of the first?

The second statement says, "the right of the people to keep and bear
arms shall not be infringed." The phrase "the right of the people" is
used three times in the Bill of Rights, and each time it is used, it
denotes "the whole of the people," not a separate group segregated by
membership in an organization.

So even if the first part was meant to limit the Second Amendment to
militia membership, why state "the right of the people"? Why not state
"the right of the militia"?

Because the first statement was not meant to limit the second.

The Supreme Court has ruled exactly this way.
