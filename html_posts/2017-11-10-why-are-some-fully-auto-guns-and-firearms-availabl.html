**Why are some fully auto guns and firearms available for sale in the
U.S.?**

I ask you: *why not?* Why should they *not* be available for sale?

Now, mind you, fully automatic firearms are heavily regulated, but they
are not illegal. You must go through an extensive background check which
includes fingerprinting and photos, and you must pay a \$200 tax to
transfer the firearm. Additionally, some states have extra regulations
on fully automatic firearms, on top of the Federal requirements.
