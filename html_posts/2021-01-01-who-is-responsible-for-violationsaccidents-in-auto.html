**Who is responsible for an accident involving an autonomous car?**

For the sake of clarity, we're not addressing *semi-autonomous cars*,
which have a driver at the controls and the vehicle is driving on its
own (like Tesla's Autopilot). In that instance, the driver is always the
person in control and is always responsible for any accidents caused.

We are only addressing *fully autonomous cars*, which in many cases
don't even have steering wheels or pedals.

When fully autonomous cars are allowed to drive in all 50 states (they
are not yet), it will be the vehicle manufacturer and the software which
will be responsible for an accident caused by the autonomous car,
following current automobile product liability laws. Humans will still
be liable for any decisions which they direct (for example, telling the
car where to park).

In fact, Volvo has already announced that they will pay for any
accidents (injuries or damages) caused by their autonomous cars.

How can they be so confident? One of the things that works in the
autonomous car's favor is that there will be a *wealth* of data
available to accident investigators from the autonomous car. This is a
huge boon in determining liability. Being able to compare how an
autonomous car responded versus how a human should have responded and
ultimately did respond will be big factors in determining
fault.[\[1\]](#fVjeF){#cite-fVjeF .citation_link}

I can confidently predict that in most cases, it will still be the human
driver who will be found at fault.
