**Content:** []{.rendered_qtext}

The grand jury delivered a vote of "no true bill" which means that there
was not probable cause that a crime was committed. This is the actual
reason. There is not a litany of reasons. There either is enough
evidence to indict, or there is not. In this case, there was not enough
evidence to show that a crime was committed, so no indictment was
returned.
