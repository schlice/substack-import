They are not spyware.

They are *adware*.

Both apps have ad servers built in to them and will serve you ads on
your home screen as well as in the app.

You're better off using the PC software and rooting your phone that way
rather than using one of these apps.

And the easiest way to do that is to use
[[**CF-Auto-Root**](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a75b09&url=https://autoroot.chainfire.eu/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="chainfire.eu"}]{.qlink_container}. Best rooting tool out
there, from the absolute smartest root expert on the planet, Chainfire.

(EDIT) Chainfire has updated his tool into a new site,
[[firmware.mobi](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e91612&url=https://desktop.firmware.mobi/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="firmware.mobi"}]{.qlink_container}. This tool allows you to
build auto root tools for nearly every Android operating system. The old
site is still there for firmware for some older phones, but you should
visit the new site to root modern Android phones.
