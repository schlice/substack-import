**What can Congress do if the White House stonewalls the subpoenas?**

1.  Make them real, enforceable subpoenas, with little chance of being
    able to wiggle out of them, by holding a full House vote on an
    impeachment inquiry. They have the votes to pass it, so they should
    just vote on it. It would legitimize the investigation, and thus
    legitimize the subpoenas.
2.  *At that point,* any subpoenas which are ignored would find the
    subject of that subpoena in contempt of Congress.
3.  Then deliver the subpoenas to the US Attorney's Office (usually the
    DC office is used for this sort of thing) to compel the person to
    provide the listed information.
4.  The person complies, or goes to jail.

If they really want answers, the method is very simple.

If they don't do this, then they don't really want answers. They want a
made-for-TV impeachment show meant to do little more than discredit the
President before an election, not actually find answers.
