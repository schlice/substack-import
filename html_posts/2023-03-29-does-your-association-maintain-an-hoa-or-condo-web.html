For both of the Associations I have lived in, I have created and
deployed the websites. I try to do so as inexpensively as possible to
allow the Association to maintain the site after I'm done with doing so.
I use simple designs and a clear layout to ensure that everyone who
needs access to the information there can get it easily.
