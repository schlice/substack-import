That one verse is part of a larger work: a letter, a psalm, a recorded
series of events. Bible scholars and theologians would look at the work
as a whole and prayerfully determine whether or not it was divinely
inspired.

If they found that the work was divinely inspired, it is reasonable to
infer that all of the verses in that particular work are all inspired.
It doesn't make logical sense that parts of a particular letter were
inspired and other parts were not. If the author was inspired by the
Holy Spirit, then the entire work was inspired.

Remember, the Bible is made up of 66 different books, written by about
40 different authors, in three languages, on three different continents,
across the span of 1500 years. But yet, they all contain the same
message, they never contradict each other, and they contain no errors of
historical fact. Human effort simply cannot produce such precision; only
the supernatural can do that.

So if *you* want to determine if a verse in the Bible is inspired, you
can look to see if there is agreement with what that verse says across
the Bible. What did other authors in other parts of the Bible say about
that verse? Does the verse also quote history, because if it does, it
must be historically accurate. And finally, does the theme of the verse
comport with the message of the Bible?
