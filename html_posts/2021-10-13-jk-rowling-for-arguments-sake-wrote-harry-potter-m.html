The Bible is a compilation of books and letters (66 of them) which were
written by about 40 different authors over the span of about 1600 years.
It was written by a wide variety of people: doctors, rabbis, tax
collectors, fishermen. It was written in 13 different countries on three
different continents. Yet there is **unity** in the message of the
Bible. The themes of the writing are maintained across the years, the
people, and the locations. And after all that space and time, the Bible
does not contradict itself. It is only by divine inspiration that such a
feat could have taken place.

Compare this to the Qur'an. It was compiled by one person, Zaid bin
Thabit, under the guidance of Mohammed's father-in-law, Abu-Bekr. Then,
in A.D. 650, a group of Arab scholars produced a unified version and
destroyed all variant copies to preserve the unity of the Qur'an.

In other words, the Bible was unified across the years, people, and
continents, from the time of its writing. The Qur'an had unity forced
upon it by human editors.

That is just one way we know that the Bible, as a whole, is the inspired
word of God. Some of the others:

- Prophesy. God spoke to men telling them the things that he was going
  to make happen in the future. There are over 300 prophecies about the
  coming of Jesus, and these were all written long before he was born.
  They all came true in his life.
- Archaeological records support what was written in the Bible. While
  people have tried to find archaeological evidence to disprove what was
  written in the Bible, to date they have failed.
- Outside writings corroborate the stories told in the Bible. For
  example, a man named Titus Flavius Josephus was a Jewish historian who
  wrote during the 1st century AD. Josephus records some events which
  also correlate with what was written in the Bible. There are others as
  well, and they all back up what was stated by the Bible authors.
- Scientific accuracy. Every scientific claim made in the Bible has been
  found to be true, despite the scientific knowledge of the age. For
  example, in Isaiah, it says "It is he who sits above the circle of the
  earth" (Isaiah 40:22 ESV). The word "circle" here translates to
  "globe" or "sphere." How did Isaiah know that the earth was a sphere,
  when all scientific knowledge at the time said the earth was flat? Job
  said, "He spreads out the northern skies over empty space; **he
  suspends the earth over nothing.**" (Job 26:7 NIV). How did Job know
  that the earth "hung in space" before modern astronomy? Divine
  inspiration.

The Bible is an amazing book. It is so deep, that scholars can spend
*lifetimes* studying it and still never completely plumb the depths of
its knowledge and wisdom. Yet its stories are so simple, children can
read the Bible and understand the major themes written within it. How
can people create something so timeless and so complete, so complex and
yet so understandable, at the times when these books were written? The
only logical conclusion is divine inspiration.

Original question:

J.K. Rowling (for arguments sake) wrote Harry Potter & made billions
through penning her gift of imagination. The Bible was written by
humans. Why do people believe Its the word of God. How can we prove
it\'s not fiction?
