**Is it illegal to take pictures of someone's house?**

*(US-specific answer)*

The answer very greatly depends on local laws in place for that area.
You may be in compliance with Federal law and be violating a state law
or a city ordinance where you are, so please take this answer with a
good pinch of salt. Always check the laws where you are before you find
yourself on the wrong side of one.

In the United States, in general, the rule of thumb is **if you can see
it, you can snap it**.

This rule does not apply in all areas and in all buildings (especially
federal buildings and military installations), so for now, I'll just
focus on residences.

This is always a good rule of thumb for residences: if you can stand on
the sidewalk and see the residence, in general you can take a picture of
it. If you can't see the residence from a public access way (such as a
sidewalk or a street), you can't breach barriers on someone's property
in order to take pictures. For example, if there is a row of tall hedges
blocking the view from the street or the sidewalk, you can't push your
way through the hedges and take a picture.

However, drones change all that. From the street, if drone flying is
allowed in that area, you can fly a drone straight up and look over
hedges to get a picture. You cannot fly over the person's property to
get a picture, but you can fly over the street or the sidewalk, straight
up, and get a picture.
