Because it's not the "right kind" of evidence.

Evidence exists. Not everyone finds the evidence compelling or
convincing --- that's by design. But that doesn't mean that the evidence
is nonexistent.

The problem is when atheists demand **proof** which is either
unreasonable or irrelevant. They tailor the definition of "evidence" so
narrowly that God's existence can never meet their unrealistic burden of
proof. Clearly, you're not going to find *physical* evidence of a God
who is not physical, and some atheists will claim that if God is not
material, then God does not exist. However, even those very same
atheists and devout skeptics agree that many things which are immaterial
do exist. For example, the laws of logic are not visible or material,
but they are indeed real and can be examined and used as proof. The same
would hold true for other concepts like morality and love. In fact,
thought and reason itself is immaterial. Yes, it involves chemicals in
the brain, but chemicals do not reason, they do not think. So thought
and reason are not purely material.

There are several broad categories of evidence for the existence of God.
None of them taken alone can prove that God exists, or even that the God
of the Bible provides an accurate description of Him. But when you take
them together, they provide a fairly compelling argument that God is
real and He does exist.

- **Humans have a natural "sense" of God.** Both anthropologists and
  historians agree that nearly all people who have ever lived have had
  some form of supernatural belief. There are vanishingly few people
  worldwide who totally reject all manifestations of a higher force or
  spirit. Even in extremely \"secular\" cultures, this is true. Secular
  fields of research like cognitive science of religion contend that
  such convictions are ingrained in the human mind\'s basic structure.
  This implies, at the very least, that there is something real to be
  perceived, just as the senses of sight and hearing focus on real
  phenomena.
- **Logic points to the existence of God.** Several logic-based
  arguments support the existence of God. Though they are challenging to
  argue against, some, such as the ontological argument, are not thought
  to be particularly compelling. Some are thought to be considerably
  more reliable, such the kalam cosmological argument. Along the same
  lines, teleological arguments---such as intelligent design---draw
  logical conclusions from facts to support the presence of God.
- **Observational science supports the existence of God.** Because so
  many components of reality seem to have been planned out, teleological
  arguments can be convincingly made. Such proof strongly suggests the
  existence of a Creator on its own. The Big Bang is a well-known
  illustration. Atheists initially opposed this theory because they felt
  it was too \"religious.\" Nonetheless, secular science\'s proof of a
  non-eternal cosmos lends substantial support to the assertions made in
  the first few chapters of the Bible.
- **History, literature and archaeology support the existence of God.**
  Whether or not opponents agree with it, the Bible is a reliable source
  of proof for God\'s existence. Not just \"because the Bible says so,\"
  but also due to the Bible\'s track record of accuracy. It is illogical
  to dismiss it as prejudiced just because it asserts ideas that
  skeptics do not agree with. That would be just as illogical as denying
  the validity of every biography of Julius Caesar and then asserting
  that there are no records mentioning him. While debating the existence
  of God, it follows that we would point to the Bible\'s accuracy and
  its consistency with secular history and archaeology.
- **Personal experiences support the existence of God.** These are
  undoubtedly compelling just for those specific people. But a lot of
  people have developed extremely personal relationships with and
  understandings of God. These experiences are legitimate to take into
  account as supporting evidence for the existence of God insofar as
  they align with other evidence. It would be virtually impossible to
  deny everyone in all of human history who has ever had any kind of
  spiritual experience. This includes Abraham, Moses, Isaiah, Kepler,
  Newton, Pascal, and Jesus Christ himself.

Finally, it's important to note that it is literally the weakest
response to evidence of God's existence to simply ignore it and claim
"there is no evidence." This claim usually comes alongside a very fluid
definition of what is considered proof. Just like what happened with the
Big Bang (which virtually no one denies by this point), atheists will
still ignore the (continually growing) mountain of evidence that the
universe, and all time, space, and matter within it, began at a single
point and nothing existed before that, and will still claim that humans
are some cosmic accident arising uncaused, from random, nonliving
chemicals. First, disprove Einstein's Theory of General Relativity and
then we'll talk about the merits of "from Goo to You through the Zoo."

But just as one person's belief that God exists doesn't make it true,
one person's disbelief doesn't make God's existence untrue. Combining
what we know from logic, science, personal experience, and other areas,
there is more than enough evidence that God exists. In fact, there is
more evidence which shows that God exists than evidence which shows that
God does not exist.

In fact, you atheists who are chomping at the bit to reply to me, **I
challenge any one of you to provide me with proof that God does not
exist.** Any proof will suffice. There is plentiful evidence of God's
existence, but there is no proof that He does not exist. Therefore, more
faith is required to be an atheist than to be a theist, because more
evidence exists proving God's existence than not.

**TL;DR:** When presented with the facts, and when presented with the
truth that it takes more faith to be an atheist than it does to be a
theist, I can understand why atheists become agitated. It's called
*cognitive dissonance*, and yes it is very annoying. It can be really
agitating to have to try to explain away all of the affirmative evidence
for the existence of God. And the farther along we go, and the more
science we learn, the more we find out that the universe is even more
impossibly complex than we could ever have imagined, and natural
processes become less and less likely to have been able to do what
atheists say they did.
