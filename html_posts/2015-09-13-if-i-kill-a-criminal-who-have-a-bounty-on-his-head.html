**Content:** [In the United States, we no longer has \"dead or alive\"
bounties. Bail enforcement is a legitimate business, and you either have
to be licensed in the state or certified by the state in order to be a
bail enforcement agent. While bail enforcement agents have more
authority over their \"skips\" than police do, there are still rules and
regulations that must be followed. When an accused signs a bail bond
contract, he waives his Constitutional rights and agrees to be
apprehended by a bail enforcement agent should he fail to appear. He
doesn\'t have to be read Miranda warnings, he can be apprehended inside
his house, which the bail enforcement agent can enter without a warrant,
they can tap his phone without a warrant, etc.\
