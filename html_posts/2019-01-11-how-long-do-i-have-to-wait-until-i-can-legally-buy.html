**How long do I have to wait until I can legally buy a gun if I've been
5150?**

It depends on the state.

Some states ban possession by people who have ever been 5150â€²d unless
they have a doctor's note that says they're good. Some states allow
possession but not carry. Some states have no restrictions at all. Some
states follow Federal law: possession is restricted if you've been
declared a mental incompetent by a court.

Check your state before you go near a gun.
