No, but the people who were the most proximate cause of her death should
be, and that would be **her doctors and the hospital lawyers who told
the doctors that they could get in trouble for performing such a
procedure because it might be considered an illegal abortion.** ***Shame
on them, damn them all to hell.***

People want to jump on the legislators in this case, but the legislators
wrote abortion exceptions into all state laws. Yes, you read that right.
Despite what some are claiming, ***every state which has an abortion ban
of any form in place has exceptions to save the life of the mother.
Every. Single. One.***

Anyone telling you that "a woman died because abortion was illegal" is
trying to play on your emotions.

Cue the commenters filling the comment section with news articles
claiming that a woman died because abortion was illegal. Those "news
organizations" are the "anyone" I referred to above. Every one of those
news articles is clickbait, trying to play on your emotions. They're
trying to get you to believe that the doctors had no choice; the law
tied their hands. They couldn't save the poor dying mother because
abortion is illegal.

It's all emotion-filled lies. All of it.

*I'll respond to the clickbait articles if I can (there are lots of
them, because news organizations are shady scam-artists), but I'll
delete any shrieking harpies who try to tell me that I'm an emotionless
piece of garbage who just wants to keep women subservient, barefoot and
pregnant in the kitchen. I'll have none of that. You know nothing about
my life and my experiences, so don't pretend that you know me because I
don't want you to kill babies. And there is no limit to the number of
comments I can delete, and no limit to the number of shrieking harpies I
can block.*
