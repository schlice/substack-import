First, there are other prescription medications that can be tried. But
if you\'re tired of popping pills, or if you have GERD caused by a
hiatal hernia, you are a potential candidate for laparoscopic
anti-reflux surgery. This surgery is very non-invasive and has an
excellent success rate. The actual surgery is called **fundoplication
surgery** for Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD).

During fundoplication surgery, the upper curve of the stomach (the
fundus) is wrapped around the esophagus and sewn into place so that the
lower portion of the esophagus passes through a small tunnel of stomach
muscle. This prevents that \"straight-line\" from the stomach up the
esophagus. Yes, we know it\'s not a straight line, but you get the
point. Also, if your GERD is caused by a hiatal hernia, that will be
repaired during the same surgery.

There are risks. One of the biggest risks is bloating and gas buildup
because the person cannot burp. The gas buildup may become more of a
nuisance than the GERD was. Fundoplication surgery is not reversible, so
the new symptoms would become permanent. So you may end up replacing a
toothache with a headache, so to speak. There are, of course, the normal
risks to surgery, related to infection, surgical complications, and
anesthesia use.

But that risk needs to be weighed against continuing to have to take
medication for the rest of your life. Because when anti-reflux surgery
is successful, it means a near-permanent cessation to GERD without
medication.
