Jail? I'm pretty sure that not reporting a change in income is not a
criminal offense.

However, reporting your new job will trigger a review. As a participant
in the Housing Choice Voucger Program (formerly Section 8), you are
required to fill out a "Family Reporting Form" within 10 days of an
income change. Five months is a bit long. Your residential coordinator
will review your Family Reporting Form and determine if and when a
change in rent is required, and what you owe for the five months you
didn't report.

At worst, you may lose eligibility for the program, but that's about the
worst that would happen. I don't think you're going to jail. Did you
fail to report because you *intended to defraud the state*? No, I didn't
think so. So since there is no criminal intent, I don't think that a
criminal charge would stick, in my opinion.
