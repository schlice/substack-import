**Content:** [Nearly every Android phone allows you to save your Camera
pictures directly to the SD card. It\'s part of the built-in features of
the camera app itself. You could download a camera app that support
direct saving to SD.\
\
Even if you didn\'t want to do that, you could create a Tasker app that
transfers any picture file to the SD card when it is placed in a
specific folder. Tasker is great for automating simple tasks like this;
definitely look into it.]{.rendered_qtext}
