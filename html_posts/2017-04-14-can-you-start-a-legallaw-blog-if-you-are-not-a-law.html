Take a look at Quora. Can we answer legal questions here?

The answer is yes, because the answers we give are general information
only. No answer here is intended to create an attorney-client
relationship, nor is it a solicitation to create one.

We also try not to answer specific legal questions, because of the very
same problem. We only address specific questions when their answers have
general applicability.

The same goes for medical questions. All of our medical answers are for
general informational purposes only, not intended to create a diagnosis
or create a doctor-patient relationship.

The relevant section from Quora's [[Terms of
Service](https://www.quora.com/about/tos)]{.qlink_container}:

I suggest you contact a lawyer so that you can fashion an appropriate
Terms of Service for your blog, so that your readers understand that
your legal blog is for informational purposes only, and does not create
any attorney-client relationship.
