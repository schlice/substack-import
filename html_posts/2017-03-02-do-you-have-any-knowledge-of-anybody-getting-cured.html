My answer reflects the majority medical opinion, that there is no cure
for MS currently.

**If you had MS, and you "did something" and cured your MS, you didn\'t
have MS.**

As you know, there are many diseases that look like MS. MS does not have
any symptoms that are unique to it. This is one of the reasons that MS
is known as \"the great imitator\". So there are a lot of diseases that
can look like MS, but be something else entirely. So it\'s highly
likely, therefore, that if you did something to \"cure\" your MS, you
didn\'t have MS in the first place. You had some other disease that very
closely mimicked MS.

While complementary and alternative medicines are great at helping to
manage MS symptoms, they cannot cure MS.
