**Is it even possible to tell the difference between when Donald Trump
is being serious and when he is joking?**

The real answer: *what difference does it make?*

The President's words do not carry the weight of law. He can say
anything he likes, and it doesn't change one iota of your life. At. All.

However, once an Executive Order is written directing an Executive
Branch agency to do or not do something, or once Congress passes a law,
or once an Executive Branch agency makes a change to a regulation,
***now*** something becomes binding on you.

So is he joking? Is he serious? *Who cares?* Is that going to change
your opinion of him?

I suspect that if you already have a negative opinion of him, nothing he
says or does will change your opinion of him. If you already have a
positive opinion of him, you'll be able to distinguish more easily
between his jokes and his seriousness.

Here's an example: the media (which has a negative opinion of him) could
not fathom the statement he made in the press conference where he joked
that if Russia was so good at hacking that maybe *they* could find
Hillary's "missing" emails.

[[Donald Trump Calls on Russia to Find Hillary Clinton's Missing
Emails](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=fcc08d&url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/28/us/politics/donald-trump-russia-clinton-emails.html){.external_link

The media went apoplectic. "He just *invited* another country to hack
us!" "He's calling for other countries to invade us!" "It's treason!"

When, in fact, it was a joke. He was trying to be humorous. He's clearly
not very good at it.
