It depends on what you mean by "unreasonable demands.\"

For example, the HOA may be telling you to tear down the shed you just
spent all weekend putting up. Unreasonable? Certainly sounds like it.
But what if your neighborhood does not allow sheds? Is it unreasonable
then?

What counts as unreasonable is whether their request can be reasonably
related to the authority granted to them by the Governing Documents.

If you truly believe that the HOA is making demands that are *so
unreasonable* as to be not authorized by the Governing Documents, you
should have little trouble retaining a real estate attorney in your area
who specializes in HOA law. Because that\'s the only way you can stop
the HOA from enforcing the Covenants and fining you for non-compliance.
