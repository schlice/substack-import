**In order to be saved, do I have to let Jesus come inside of me?**

It's figurative. It's not literal. A ghost spectre will not inhabit your
body like a Twilight Zone possession.

Often, you're told that you need to "ask Jesus to come in to your
heart." You should know that this statement is nowhere in the Bible.
Often, when people say that, they mean "ask Jesus to come into your
life" or "ask Jesus to take control of your life." But even those
statements should not be made in a vacuum. Before you think about any of
those things, you should understand sin and its penalty, what Jesus did
to pay for your sin, and what you need to do in order to benefit from
that gift that he gave you. If asking Jesus to come into your heart
helps you to understand that, all the better.

Remember, salvation is not about believing a list of facts. Salvation is
not about allowing Jesus to enter your heart. Salvation is about
trusting Jesus as your savior, believing what he did for you, and
accepting his forgiveness that he offers by grace. Salvation is about
being "made new" through his sacrifice and the power of the Holy Spirit.
