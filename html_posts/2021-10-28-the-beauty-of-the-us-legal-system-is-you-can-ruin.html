So it doesn't seem like you asked a question here. You made a statement.

In most cases, doxing in and of itself is not illegal, especially at the
federal level.

That said, depending on where you live, doxing may violate certain other
rules, like laws designed to combat stalking, threats, and harassment.

So while doxing itself may not be technically illegal, you still may
find yourself on the wrong side of the law if you do it.

Original question:

The beauty of the US legal system is you can ruin someone\'s life online
by posting private information about them, or dox them, and there\'s
nothing they can do because it\'s protected by First Amendment?
