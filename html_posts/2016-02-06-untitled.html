I\'m glad you like it. I do not work for DU (promise), but over the
years of using Android, I found that their speed booster and battery
saver work far better than others, their notifications and reminders are
not too annoying, and the feature set is polished and user friendly. I
recommend their products to friends and family who struggle with the
quirks of Android, and it makes their experience a little more pleasant.
