**Do US Customs and border officials actually have more authority than
police officers?**

Yes and no.

CBP agents have a very specific assignment: protecting the US border.
This is a much more narrow set of laws they are required to enforce,
unlike state-based police officers, who must enforce the entire set of
laws of the state. In this sense, police officers have far more
authority to prosecute crimes against the state than CBP agents.

However, if we're talking ***Constitutionally***, at border crossings,
CBP can conduct searches which would otherwise violate the 4th Amendment
(i.e. they can search vehicles and contents of vehicles without a
warrant, or even probable cause). Federal law also allows them to
operate in the "Border Zone," anywhere up to 100 miles inland from any
US "external boundary." Away from the border, CBP is technically
required to have a warrant or probable cause that an immigration
violation has taken place before they can conduct a border search, but
this is both not well understood and frequently broken. The ability to
conduct "extra-Constitutional searches" is an authority that USCBP
agents have that local police do not.
