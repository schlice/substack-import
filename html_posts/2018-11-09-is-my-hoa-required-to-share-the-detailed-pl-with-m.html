**Is my HOA required to share the detailed P&L with me?**

It depends on your state. Not every state requires HOAs to share
detailed P&L statements directly with you. Most do it anyway. Most share
their P&L statements during the Annual Meeting.

You can usually request a copy of your HOA's P&L statement from the
Management Agency working with your HOA.
