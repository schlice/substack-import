**If I'm getting texted anonymously, can I get a restraining order if I
know who's doing it?**

Most likely, no. It's much easier and quicker to simply enable blocking
of anonymous SMS messages.

In iPhones, you can block iMessages from anonymous or unknown sources,
but SMS messages are a little more difficult to block. You may need to
install a third party app to do it. This post at Apple's site has a
little more information:

In Android, block unknown contacts from within the Messaging app itself.
Since there are multiple messaging apps, it's difficult to say where
exactly in the Settings you will find this, but they all have it.
Android also has third-party apps which can manage unknown SMS messages.
