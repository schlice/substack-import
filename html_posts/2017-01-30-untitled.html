Your question reminds me of Homer Simpson\'s dad when he was writing a
letter to the president:

"Dear Mr. President: there are too many states nowadays. Please
eliminate three. I am not a crackpot."

The states are what they are. And I think you are thinking of the House,
not the Senate. In the Senate, every state gets two Senators, from
California to Rhode Island.

Therefore, the Senate provides the states-based balance to Congress that
the House lacks. The House provides the population-based focus to
legislation, and the two together, which are required to pass laws,
strike a good balance.
