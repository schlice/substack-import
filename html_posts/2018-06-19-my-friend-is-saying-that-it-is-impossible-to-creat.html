**My friend is saying that it is impossible to create an AI that can
mimic or exceed the human brain, how can I prove it otherwise?**

The classic test to determine if an AI is as smart as a human is what's
called the [[Turing
test](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=753614&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test){.external_link

standard for AI.

If your computer AI can pass the Turing test, then this is how you prove
that an AI can mimic or exceed the human brain.
