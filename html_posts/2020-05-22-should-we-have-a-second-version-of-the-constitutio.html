**Should we have a second version of the constitution for private
companies to protect the employees?**

No.

The Constitution is not a document related to protecting employees. The
Constitution is designed to define what government is, what government
is authorized to do (in the first part), and what government is not
authorized to do (in the first ten Amendments, called the Bill of
Rights).

If you want to protect employees, you pass laws. If you think that there
are not enough laws defining how private companies are required to
protect employees, then you probably need to re-take your Business 101
class.

But by all means, if you believe that new laws are needed, lobby your
Congresspeople to get those laws written. Or better yet, find an
affinity group who shares your views. There's power in numbers.
