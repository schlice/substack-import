Why in God\'s name would you think that a **vote** **** would somehow
change my moral character? Do you *really, truly believe* that the
election of a President gives human beings some sort of permission to be
racist, or xenophobic, or inhuman?

Seriously, grow up. My vote doesn\'t change who I am. If I was inclined
to do any of the morally bankrupt things you listed in your question,
***i was going to do them anyway*** because I\'m already morally
bankrupt. My vote didn\'t change that.

Unless you\'re implying that all Trump voters are morally bankrupt. If
you truly believe that, not only are you not paying attention, but you
completely missed the real reason Trump was elected.
