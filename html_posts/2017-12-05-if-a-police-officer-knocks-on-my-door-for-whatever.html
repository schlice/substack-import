**If a police officer knocks on my door (for whatever reason), I answer
it, and in plain view he sees illegal weapons or contraband, can he
arrest me?**

Yes. This is called the "plain sight" exception to the 4th Amendment
restriction against unreasonable search.

If you have illegal anything in plain sight (meaning the officer did not
have to move anything or touch anything in order to make it visible),
the officer is then allowed to confiscate that evidence and arrest you
for its possession, as well as use it as probable cause to conduct a
further search.

You should also note that smelling marijuana in most states is called
the "plain smell" exception, and works exactly like the "plain sight"
exception. This is true in your car as well. If the officer smells
marijuana or alcohol in your car, that provides the probable cause to
search your car.
