It's unlikely that you'll find specifics about any item in a state's
Constitution. The Constitutions of individual states usually mirror what
is said in the US Constitution, that is, they lay out broad sets of
rights, such as "the right of the people to keep and bear arms for self
defense" and the like.

Individual tools and weapons will be enumerated in a state's laws, not
in its Constitution.

In Texas, the law itself is actually pretty thin, so you have to look to
legislation and case law to find out what is legal to carry and what is
not. You can find the law itself in Texas Penal Code §46.02, Unlawful
Carrying Weapons:

> § 46.01. Definitions
>
> In this chapter:\
> .....(6) "Illegal knife" means a:\
> (A) knife with a blade over five and one-half inches;\
> (B) hand instrument designed to cut or stab another by being thrown;\
> (C) dagger, including but not limited to a dirk, stiletto, and
> poniard;\
> (D) bowie knife;\
> (E) sword; or\
> (F) spear.\
> (7) "Knife" means any bladed hand instrument that is capable of
> inflicting serious bodily injury or death by cutting or stabbing a
> person with the instrument.
>
> § 46.02. Unlawful Carrying Weapons
>
> \(a\) A person commits an offense if the person intentionally,
> knowingly, or recklessly carries on or about his or her person a
> handgun, illegal knife, or club if the person is not:
>
> \(1\) on the person's own premises or premises under the person's
> control; or
>
> \(2\) inside of or directly en route to a motor vehicle or watercraft
> that is owned by the person or under the person's control

That's about the extent of the law. So to get more specifics, you have
to go to case law. The following cases are generally cited to define
knife carry laws:

- Rainer v. State, 763 S.W.2d 615 (Tex. App. 1989)
- Smith v. State, 1988 Tex. App. (Tex. App. 1988)
- Albert v. State, 659 S.W.2d 41 (Tex. App. 1983)
- Armendariz v. State, 396 S.W.2d 132 (Tex. Crim. App. 1965)
- Cook v. State, 2005 Tex. App. LEXIS 3053

Specific to carry, these cases effectively define the following:

- It is illegal to conceal or open carry any knife with a blade over 5 ½
  inches long
- It is illegal to conceal or open carry throwing stars or any type of
  throwing knife
- It is illegal to conceal or open carry dirks, daggers, stilettos, and
  other stabbing knives
- It is illegal to conceal or open carry a bowie knife
- It is illegal to conceal or open carry a sword or spear

Carry restrictions do not apply to a person's own vehicle or a vehicle
that is under their control, as long as the weapon is being carried for
a lawful purpose.[\[1\]](#BtwoW){#cite-BtwoW .citation_link}
