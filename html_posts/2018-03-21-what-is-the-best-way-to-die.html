**How can you kill yourself without a gun?**

Ask the Japanese. They have a high rate of suicide and a very low rate
of gun ownership.

Since it's not my idea of a fun evening to give anyone ideas about how
to kill themselves, if you are truly interested, use Google to search
for "suicide in Japan."

And if you happen to be a person who is contemplating taking their own
life but you don't have access to a gun, don't. Just don't. As the box
on this page states, "There is help." If you are seriously considering
suicide, please use the resources in that box (country-specific
resources are listed).
