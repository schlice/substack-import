**How long do kids have after they turn 18 to sue the rapists their
welfare mothers left them with?**

There are a lot of moving parts to your question. The amount of time you
have to bring civil suit for sexual assault varies wildly between the
states. For example, in Florida, currently filing suit against your
attacker for criminal sexual assault is allowed within 7 years after you
turn 18, within 4 years of the time you discover the link between a
related injury and the abuse, and within 4 years of the time you
abandon/stop depending on the abuser. However, in California, you have
until you turn 40, or within 5 years of the time you discover the link
between a related injury and the abuse, whichever is later.

So the short answer is it depends on the state in which the abuse took
place and the laws there. However, laws are changing quickly. In
Florida, they passed **Donna's Law** in 2020, which removes the statute
of limitations for criminally prosecuting acts of sexual battery against
children under 18. However, the law *is not retroactive*; in other
words, it only applies to sexual battery which occurred after the law
was passed (July 1, 2020). Many states are modifying their laws
regarding statutes of limitations for sexual assault on a minor. This is
why it is crucial that you reach out to a personal injury attorney as
soon as you can, otherwise the time you have to file a claim may expire.

**Can a minor child who suffered being raped sue their custodial mother
too, when they turn 18 or is the rape of a child not the problem of the
custodian?**

Yes, if a sexual assault occurs due to someone else's negligence, that
party may be liable. All caretakers have a *duty of care* over those for
whom they care. If that duty of care is violated, and that negligence
causes injury to another, that party may be liable for violating that
duty of care.

Again, it is imperative that you reach out to a personal injury attorney
in your area as soon as possible, or the time you have to file a claim
may expire.
