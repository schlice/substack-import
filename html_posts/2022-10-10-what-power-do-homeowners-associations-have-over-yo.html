The correct answer is that the HOA (which is essentially a contract you
enter into, albeit a mandatory one, when you buy a house in a particular
neighborhood) is an organization to which you voluntarily *cede* control
of certain design aspects of the exterior of your home. That
responsibility is borne by the ARB (the Architecture Review Board ---
your HOA may call it something different, it's the same thing though).
The ARB has complete design control over the whole neighborhood, and
they can ensure that it all looks a certain way.

In such a neighborhood, if you want to make a change to how the exterior
of your house looks, the ARB must approve that change.

In order to enforce its provisions, the HOA also has a *financial
interest* over your property, as they become the *first non-mortgage
lienholder* on your house. So the primary lienholder on your house is
your mortgage holder, and the very next lienholder on your house is the
HOA. *The HOA is even in line in front of the IRS if you owe back taxes
on your house.* In practice, what this means is that if you owe money to
the HOA, they can put a lien on your house, and if you don't pay, they
can foreclose on that lien and sell your house out from under you in
order to get their money.
