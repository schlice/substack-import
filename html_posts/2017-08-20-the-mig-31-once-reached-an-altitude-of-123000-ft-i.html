title: "The MiG-31 once reached an altitude of 123,000 ft. It can also reach speeds of 3,500 km/hr. Can it play the same role as an SR 71 Blackbird, albeit less effectively?"

The problem with the argument is that the questioner assumes we need a
replacement for the SR-71.

While the MiG-31 could do something similar in flight characteristics to
the SR-71 (albeit for a very short time and with great risk to the
airframe and pilot), not even the SR-71 performs that mission anymore.
It has been supplanted by *satellite* data. Over time, flying a
satellite is much cheaper than flying a SR-71.
