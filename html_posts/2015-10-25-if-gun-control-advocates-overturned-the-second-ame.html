**Content:** [Let\'s just stop this hypothetical right here before we
ever get to how to overthrow the government, because the whole idea is
just silly on its face. \"Gun control advocates,\" by themselves, can\'t
\"overturn\" the Second Amendment. To repeal an amendment, you have to
pass a new amendment which does just that. For example, the 21st
Amendment repealed the 18th Amendment.\
\
Amendments require ***broad, popular support.*** You need Congress to
write the amendment, and then you need a 2/3 majority in Congress to
pass it, followed by 3/4 of the states ratifying it. That means you need
38 states with a majority of people who believe that the Second
Amendment is no longer needed because the police can keep me safe from
bad guys (because when seconds count, the police are only minutes away),
and that whole \"resistance to tyranny\" thing is a bunch of hogwash,
because the government will never take my rights away, right?\
\
Except for those pesky guns\...\
\
Besides, Congress will never pass such an amendment. It\'s political
suicide. Taking away rights? Good luck with that. Heck, Colorado passed
a 10-round magazine limit, and the two state representatives who
authored the bill were *recalled*. So yeah, there\'s no chance that
Congress will even author an amendment repealing the Second Amendment.\
\
Since there\'s no way Congress will do it, you have to go grassroots.
Your only option is to get 34 state legislatures ( a 2/3 majority) to
call for a *Constitutional Convention* to propose a new amendment
repealing the Second Amendment. However, once they write the amendment,
you still need 38 states (a 3/4 majority) to ratify it. Understand
though, this has never been done in the history of the country. We have
27 Amendments, and all 17 times (the first 10 were all written
together), Congress has authored the Amendment.\
\
I don\'t even want to press the remainder of the hypothetical, because
it\'s simply too silly. But assuming that an amendment was passed that
repealed the Second Amendment, the 100 million or so gun owners would
probably act much like Australia. When guns were restricted (heavily)
through their legislative process, and they instituted a buyback, it\'s
estimated that about 250,000 rifles and an unknown number of handguns
were left, and still remain today, on the gray market. I\'d expect
higher numbers in America. Most of the guns turned in were rusty,
unwanted guns that were just sitting in a closet somewhere anyway.\
\
No \"insurrection\" would take place, because lawful gun owners know
that the amendment process worked as it was supposed to, and the vast
majority of Americans wanted to get rid of the Second Amendment, so they
would accept that they were in the minority. I suspect, though, that
they would also be happy remaining *criminals* and retaining their
guns.]{.rendered_qtext}
