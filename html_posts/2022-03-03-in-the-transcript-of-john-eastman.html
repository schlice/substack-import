The salient part in the Fifth Amendment is bolded:

The 5th Amendment simply says that you cannot be forced, in a criminal
case, to be a witness against yourself.

So if, in answering a question, the answer would implicate you
criminally, you are not required to answer that question.

It doesn't matter the subject of the question. If the answer would
implicate you, then you are not required to answer it.

Now, prosecutors could ***cut a deal*** with him, wherein he would
answer the question with a **guarantee** that he would not be indicted
for any criminal behavior of his which his testimony may or may not
reveal. If they really want to "nail Trump," they'd offer him that deal.

If they're not offering him that deal, it's because they're not going
after Trump. That's probably because they don't believe they have enough
on Trump to go after him, and this testimony wouldn't be enough either.

Original question:

In the transcript of John Eastman\'s attempt to block the release of his
emails to the 1/6 Committee, he consistently pleads the Fifth. He
continues to plead the Fifth when the questioning shifts to Trump\'s
actions. Does the Fifth still apply here?
