As we have witnessed in a variety of SCOTUS cases over the years, not
only can you not compel the federal government to enforce the law, you
can't complain when the federal government makes an immigration law you
don't agree with, and you cannot usurp a power given to the federal
government and enforce it yourself.

Immigration is an Executive function. The Executive has broad authority
to control who comes across the border, and has the authority to protect
national security with that power.

The border can be as porous or as solid as the Executive chooses it to
be, and the states do not have a say in that decision. Right or wrong,
for better or worse, that's how Congress set it up.

Governor DeSantis is frustrated with the federal government's apparent
inaction on their own border policy. I share his frustration. If the
federal government wants to allow anyone and everyone into the country,
they should have the testicular fortitude to modify immigration law to
allow for that. Then, they should be responsive to the needs of the most
affected states, and should provide federal aid to deal with the influx
of n---e---w--- D---e---m---o---c---r---a---t---
v---o---t---e---r---s--- new US citizens.

Original question:

If the Biden administration won\'t enforce immigration laws, should the
states be able to transport illegals to Delaware, as Governor DeSantis
suggested in Florida?
