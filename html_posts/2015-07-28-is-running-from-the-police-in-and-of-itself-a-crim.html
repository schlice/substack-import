TL;DR: in most localities, running away from the police is not, in and
of itself, a crime.

If you\'re allowed to walk away from the police (which you are, assuming
you were not stoppped by the police, you\'re not being investigated by
the police, etc), who cares how fast you go?

There are some very narrow exceptions to this rule. Some high crime
areas have had ordinances passed which allow running from the police to
be considered **reasonable suspicion** that a crime has, or is going to
be, committed. This allows the police to catch the runner and perform a
*Terry* search on that person. If the search reveals evidence of the
crime, or evidence that a person is going to commit a crime, that person
can then be arrested. However, in that instance, the police have to be
performing general investigation in that area, searching for evidence of
that crime, and the evidence found on the suspect must match the
evidence which the police were searching for.

Will someone who runs from the police raise suspicion? Absolutely. If
the police are already in the area searching for a suspect in a recent
crime, and if you vaguely fit that description, and you see the police
and run, the police have their reasonable suspicion right there. In
practice, it\'s a fair chance that the police can find reasonable
suspicion to stop you anyway; running simply compounds the suspicion and
makes their initial suspicion more plausible.

Put simply: running is a bad idea.
