First of all, I respect Justice Stevens for his work.

However, some of his statements in his article are incorrect at best,
and intentionally inflammatory at worst.

For example, he states the following:

> *For over 200 years after the adoption of the Second Amendment, it was
> uniformly understood as not placing any limit on either federal or
> state authority to enact gun control legislation. In 1939 the Supreme
> Court unanimously held that Congress could prohibit the possession of
> a sawed-off shotgun because that weapon had no reasonable relation to
> the preservation or efficiency of a "well regulated militia."*

This is incorrect. The court in *US v. Miller* (which is a case we
generally do not like to cite because Miller nor his counsel was present
to defend himself) did not hold that a sawed-off shotgun had no
reasonable relation to the preservation of a "well-regulated militia"
which implies that the right guaranteed in the Second Amendment is
inextricably tied to militia service, which has always been untrue. The
court *actually* held that a sawed-off shotgun could be regulated
because *it was not in common use in the military*. *Miller* imposed the
"common use" test that we use today.

But "common use" is not all we look at when we discuss firearms, because
clearly, fully-automatic M-16s and M4s are in "common use" in today's
military, and those items are also restricted from civilian ownership.
So clearly there is more than just "common use."

He goes on to say:

> *In 2008, the Supreme Court overturned Chief Justice Burger's and
> others' long-settled understanding of the Second Amendment's limited
> reach by ruling, in District of Columbia v. Heller, that there was an
> individual right to bear arms.*

He's not only being deceitful here, but he's performing an activity
known as "revisionist history." If anything, *Heller* corrected some of
the incorrect interpretations of the Second Amendment being a collective
right and cemented the traditional, natural-rights based understanding
that the Second Amendment is actually an individual right, as it was
intended to be.

There was no long-settled understanding of anything related to the
Second Amendment, and *Miller* certainly didn't confer any idea that gun
ownership was only relegated to service in a "well regulated militia" as
he likes to believe. If that were the case, 44 state constitutions would
have had to be re-written because they all guarantee their citizens the
right to keep and bear arms while not serving in an organized state
militia. Indeed, even Federal law would have needed to be overturned, as
it classifies all citizens as members of the unorganized militia. Notice
that Federal law was *not* repealed, even after *Miller. Nothing* is
ever "long-settled" when it comes to the SCOTUS.

Then he goes on to say

> *Overturning \[DC v. Heller\] via a constitutional amendment to get
> rid of the Second Amendment would be simple and would do more to
> weaken the N.R.A.'s ability to stymie legislative debate and block
> constructive gun control legislation than any other available option.*

So the question remains: *Is repealing the Second Amendment simple?*

To answer that question, we first need to answer the question of how you
repeal a Constitutional amendment. So how do you do it? *You must pass
another amendment to overturn the Second Amendment.*

There are two ways to draft an amendment to the Constitution:

1.  Two thirds of Congress can pass a Bill of Amendment (that means you
    need a supermajority in both houses of Congress)
2.  Two thirds of the states can vote to call a Constitutional
    Convention to draft and approve an Amendment. This is sometimes
    called an "Article V Convention" since Article V of the Constitution
    authorizes it.

Note that in the entire history of our nation, an Article V Convention
has never been called. Apparently, it's easier to get a supermajority of
Congress to pass a Bill of Amendment than it is to get two thirds of the
states to call for an Article V Convention.

So that's a pretty big hurdle in and of itself to overcome: you'd have
to get two thirds of Congress to approve an Amendment which repeals the
Second Amendment. And thanks to the direct election of Senators, every
single Member of Congress is directly beholden to the people, so they
will all only vote as the people want them to vote. So if there's no
supermajority of American citizens who want to repeal the Second
Amendment, Congress certainly won't pass a Bill of Amendment which does
just that.

But let's assume that somehow, you can get a supermajority of Congress
to pass a Bill of Amendment which repeals the Second Amendment. You
still have to ***ratify*** the amendment before it becomes part of the
Constitution. Ratification requires three fourths of the State
legislatures (38 states) to vote to ratify the amendment for inclusion
into the Constitution. Therefore, you have to have a majority of
legislatures in 38 separate states (not just New York, California,
Illinois and Massachusetts) vote to repeal the Second Amendment by
ratifying a new amendment. A second method of ratification is [[state
ratifying
conventions](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b151fc&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_ratifying_conventions){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}, which have been used
only one time in US history: to ratify the 21st Amendment.
Interestingly, the 21st Amendment was the Amendment which repealed the
18th Amendment, which introduced Prohibition.

Does that sound "simple" to you? I believe Justice Stevens' definition
of "simple" is much different than mine is, as well as his
interpretation of SCOTUS' legislative history.

None of this says anything at all about how you can get 300 million guns
out of the hands of citizens when you do repeal the Second Amendment.
Can you simply make all guns illegal to possess? Article 1 Paragraph 9
of the Constitution prohibits Congress from passing any laws which apply
*ex post facto* and Article 1 Paragraph 10 applies the same restriction
on the states. Can you do a buyback? The Fifth Amendment requires you to
pay fair market value for the guns. You think the government has enough
money to pay fair market value for 300 million guns? They couldn't print
money fast enough! I mean, if it was so "simple" to repeal the Second
Amendment, you may as well repeal Article 1 paragraphs 9 and 10 so you
can make possession of a gun a crime, and repeal the Fifth Amendment as
well so you can avoid having to pay fair market value for any
now-illegal guns you seize.

And what if people simply don't turn the guns in? You need warrants
before you can search people's homes. You'd next have to repeal the
Fourth Amendment as well as the Fifth Amendment so that you can bust
into every home in America without a warrant and attempt to seize the
guns. If I was an active cop at that time, I'd certainly not volunteer
to do that.

I suppose, alternatively, you could then repeal the Posse Comitatus Act
and force the military and the National Guard to do it, but by that
point, you've destroyed enough of the Constitution that you've then
simply guaranteed the next Civil War.

**TL;DR: There is absolutely nothing simple at all about repealing the
Second Amendment, and it's only the beginning of the troubles that doing
so would cause.**
