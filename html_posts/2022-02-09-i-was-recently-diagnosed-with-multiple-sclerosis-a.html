So the short answer is talk to your neurologist if you are planning on
becoming pregnant. They may want you to stop your Tecfidera during your
pregnancy, as pregnancy hormones suppress MS symptoms. But beware:
you'll probably relapse after you give birth; it's a very common thing
for women with MS who get pregnant.

Original question:

I was recently diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and taking Dimethyl
Fumarate 240 mg. Can I get pregnant? If so, what is the side effect? Is
there any natural medicine available?
