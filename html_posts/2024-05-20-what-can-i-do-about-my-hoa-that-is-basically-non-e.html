There could be several reasons for this.

1.  The HOA may still be managed by the builder. In neighborhoods which
    are still under construction, the HOA is managed by the builder. The
    HOA is not transitioned to the homeowners until after the builder
    leaves the neighborhood.
2.  You may have a version of a "no-contact HOA" which is supposed to be
    super-simple and hands-free for the homeowners. Some builders in the
    2000s were trying to implement these HOA structures. They don't have
    a Board of homeowners; they are completely managed by a managing
    agent. The managing agent takes care of maintaining insurance on the
    common areas, maintaining contracts for lawn maintenance, paying the
    water bill, snow removal (if your area needs it), etc. It's all
    hands-free for the homeowners.

We had one of these in Colorado. The builder was trying to make it as
easy as possible for the homeowners. No Board to manage, nothing to do,
just pay the money and the HOA stuff is all taken care of. He had the
best of intentions when he put it in.

But it didn't work as well as he probably envisioned. The managing agent
who ran the HOA was a real ass. We'd tried to ask him questions, like
"which companies did you compare when contracting landscaping?" and
"what areas are cleared when we pay for 'snow removal'?" Not only did he
not answer us, he was downright *nasty* when he did. A real
people-person, that one.

So we talked to our builder about it (he still owned about half the lots
in the neighborhood), and he said that if we wanted a homeowner-managed
HOA, we could have one. He even volunteered to foot the bill for the
lawyer to make the change. All we had to do was get the requisite
signatures from the current owners to make it so.

So how do you know what you have? Get hold of your Governing Documents
for your HOA. If you can't get them from the HOA themselves, get them
from your city or county (depending on where your HOA is located). The
CC&R will explain the structure of the HOA and who you can contact.

If your HOA actually exists and is unresponsive, I would highly suggest
contacting a real estate attorney in your area who specializes in HOA
law. For a small fee, they can probably assist with sending some
certified mail to the HOA demanding responses to communications. If they
refuse to respond, usually the CC&R and your local laws will have a
procedure to restructure a non-functioning HOA to one that does
function.
