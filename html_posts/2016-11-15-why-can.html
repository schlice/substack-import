Protesters should **accept** that the election is over, and no amount of
protesting is going to change the outcome. If that's why you're
protesting, go home. You're wasting your time. The vast majority of the
votes have been counted (there are still some absentee ballots which
will not be counted in some states, but they don't count, no pun
intended). You're not going to find any more under a dinner plate
somewhere. That particular part of the election is over.

Protesters should **accept** that every citizen in the United States has
*one vote*, and they have the right to vote for whoever they choose. If
you want to protest something, protest the fact that there were people
in the United States who voted for Harambe (the dead gorilla from the
Cincinnati Zoo). Protest stupidity. Do not disparage the people who cast
their votes, regardless of who they voted for (unless they voted for
Harambe; that's just stupid). I find it downright dangerous that we have
moved away from protesting against the man and casting aspersions on the
people who voted for him. That is **not** how democracy works. Remember
"love trumps hate" from just a few weeks ago? Would you say that calling
the people that voted for Trump racist xenophobic bigots is love, or
hate? I'm not hearing lots of love there...

Protesters should **not accept** anything from the president-elect that
they disagree with. If you're going to protest anything at all, protest
the policies of the president-elect. You're kinda wasting your time
until he actually assumes office and implements policies (since we know
that campaign rhetoric and actual policy are two very different things).
*Then* you have something to protest! But currently, you're protesting
*the media's representation* of the man, and we know the media is
spot-on 100% of the time, right? \</sarcasm\> Hey, if you can earn a
decent living off of the teat of George Soros, feel free to protest the
president-elect every day. Whatever floats your boat. But if you want to
tout how "democracy works," the First Amendment allows you to
"***peaceably*** *assemble."* It says nothing about riots. Rioting is
illegal, and if it continues once the president-elect becomes president,
expect a crackdown. So stand there with your signs and your chants all
you want. Start destroying property or looting stores and expect your
"protest" to get shut down.

I believe that you protesters don't really know the man. I truly don't.
I believe you know the media representation of him, but I don't think
you really know him. Of course, it's only anecdotal, but I meet people
roughly weekly who have spoken directly to him and no one has had an
unkind thing to say about him. It doesn't matter what their job is. I
spoke to a housekeeper this morning who also sees the disconnect between
the man she knows and the man portrayed by the media.

So perhaps we should think about giving him a fair shake and seeing what
kind of policies he implements. Heck, he hasn't even taken office yet.
