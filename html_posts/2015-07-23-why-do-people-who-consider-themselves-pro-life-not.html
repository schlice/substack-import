**Content:** [The sentences aren\'t even vaguely analogous.\
\
An \"abortion\" is not an object like a \"gun.\" A gun, all by itself,
does nothing. An abortion is an activity, it\'s not an object. The two
are not even analogous.\
\
Your logic reads:\
\
Abortion requires a person to \"pull the trigger.\"\
Guns require a person to pull the trigger.\
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\
Therefore, Abortion is equal to guns.\
\
This is an example of **fallacious logic.**\
\
Additionally, the court has ruled that a fetus is not a person. Until
that changes, people aren\'t actually killing people when they have an
abortion. They\'re killing a collection of cells that vaguely looks like
a very tiny person, but really isn\'t.]{.rendered_qtext}
