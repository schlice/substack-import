**Why hasn\'t the Trump Administration considered protecting businesses
that reopen from financial liability if their employees return to work
and become infected with Choronavirus?**

Because it's unneeded.

Your employment is **at-will**. If a business opens in accordance with
the law, and you freely choose to go work there, you take that risk on
to yourself. Clearly, the business must present a "safe" work
environment (or as safe as they can make it), but beyond OSHA
requirements for a safe workplace, you take the risk of viral infection
on yourself.

In other words, you have imputed additional liability where none exists.

Businesses already provide health care for their employees who meet the
criteria for it. Businesses have taken precautions to prevent the spread
of COVID-19 (additional cleaning, reminding customers about separation
guidelines, etc). The business is no more responsible for any one person
(customer or employee) contracting the virus than the government is for
allowing the business to re-open.

Secondarily, you can't prove that you contracted a virus in any one
place, so how can you assign liability when you can't prove that the
entity you target had acted negligently?

**TL;DR: It's no one's fault if you get a virus, unless someone
maliciously targeted you with a cough or a sneeze.**
