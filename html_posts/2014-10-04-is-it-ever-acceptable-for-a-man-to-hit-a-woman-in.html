**Content:** [You\'re taking about two different concepts: self-defense
and chivalry.\
\
Self-defense is a legal right, and anyone has the right to defend
themselves against anyone else. Doesn\'t matter if the aggressor is a
man or a woman, a dog or a fish.\
\
Chivalry is not a legal concept, but a social one. We expect men to not
hit women because chivalry acknowledges that men are stronger than women
in most physiological cases.\
\
The story of the Native American man that
[[User](https://www.quora.com/profile/None)]{.qlink_container} shared is
a sad intersection between the two concepts. If he would have called the
police earlier, he would have legal basis for getting custody.\
\
The police in Colorado are required to arrest the primary physical
aggressor, their hands are tied. It\'s the hardest law to enforce
because every one of these situations is totally sad. DVs are a
challenge for all parties involved. In stories about physical
aggression, it\'s really hard to sort out what happened, but in most
cases, the primary aggressor is the one who started using aggression
**first**, not necessarily the one with the bigger bruises, or the one
with bruises at all. If it is well-established that there was an
**instigator** in the conflict, that\'s the person that goes to jail. So
if a person is being punched repeatedly and then a physical act of
self-defense happens, the puncher goes to jail.]{.rendered_qtext}
