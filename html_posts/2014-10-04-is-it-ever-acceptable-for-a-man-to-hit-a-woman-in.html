<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You\'re taking about two different concepts: self-defense<br>and chivalry.\<br>\<br>Self-defense is a legal right, and anyone has the right to defend<br>themselves against anyone else. Doesn\'t matter if the aggressor is a<br>man or a woman, a dog or a fish.\<br>\<br>Chivalry is not a legal concept, but a social one. We expect men to not<br>hit women because chivalry acknowledges that men are stronger than women<br>in most physiological cases.\<br>\<br>The story of the Native American man that<br>[User(https://www.quora.com/profile/None)]{.qlink_container} shared is<br>a sad intersection between the two concepts. If he would have called the<br>police earlier, he would have legal basis for getting custody.\<br>\<br>The police in Colorado are required to arrest the primary physical<br>aggressor, their hands are tied. It\'s the hardest law to enforce<br>because every one of these situations is totally sad. DVs are a<br>challenge for all parties involved. In stories about physical<br>aggression, it\'s really hard to sort out what happened, but in most<br>cases, the primary aggressor is the one who started using aggression<br>first, not necessarily the one with the bigger bruises, or the one<br>with bruises at all. If it is well-established that there was an<br>instigator in the conflict, that\'s the person that goes to jail. So<br>if a person is being punched repeatedly and then a physical act of<br>self-defense happens, the puncher goes to jail.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
