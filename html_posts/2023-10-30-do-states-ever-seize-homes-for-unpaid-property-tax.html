No. Property taxes are levied by counties and cities, not states. So
states do not seize homes for unpaid property taxes, but county and city
governments do, all the bloody time.

Also, if you don't pay your income tax, the IRS can put a lien on your
house, and then foreclose on the lien to be paid. But the IRS has to
wait in line behind the bank, the local government, and the HOA. Once
they get paid, then the IRS can get paid.
