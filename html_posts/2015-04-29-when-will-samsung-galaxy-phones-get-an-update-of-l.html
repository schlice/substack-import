**Content:** [In order:\
\
1. When Samsung introduces a version of TouchWiz built on Lollipop for
the platform in question (already done for the S6, in progress for other
platforms), and provides it to the carriers.\
2. When the carriers take those firmwares and re-brand them, and push
those updates to the handsets.\
\
We are seeing that some carriers have been releasing 5.0.1 TouchWiz
updates for the S4 and the transition has been less-than-smooth. I\'d
give it some time to shake out before upgrading.]{.rendered_qtext}
