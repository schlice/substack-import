Let's look at an example: the Roman Catholic church practices
excommunication. Excommunication is designed to ***reform*** the person,
not ***punish*** them.

A person who has been excommunicated from the Catholic Church faces the
following penalties:

- Being barred from the sacraments, including the Eucharist
- Being forbidden from participating in public worship
- Being deprived of any previously held office or ministry
- Being refused a Catholic burial

Clearly, they can still go about their lives, just not as a Catholic.

Excommunication is usually only imposed after other attempts at
reconciliation have failed. The offender must meet certain conditions,
including:

- Being at least 16 years old
- Knowing that their actions violated Church law
- Acting freely without threat of force or by fear
- Having the use of reason
- Not having acted mistakenly

Some excommunications can be lifted after the person repents and in some
cases, offers restitution. Other excommunications are automatic, such
as:

- Mortal sin of abortion
- Desecrating the Holy Eucharist
- Being ordained a priest without prior orders from the Pope
