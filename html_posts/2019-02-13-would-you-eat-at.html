**Would you eat at "Cracker Barrel" after discovering it fired an
employee for giving a 73 yr old homeless veteran a corn muffin?**

Actually, that's not really what happened. So before we go off the
rails, let's get our story straight.

[[Vietnam veteran, 73, loses job at Cracker Barrel after giving muffin
to needy
man](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=893ec3&url=https://www.foxnews.com/us/vietnam-veteran-73-loses-job-at-cracker-barrel-after-giving-muffin-to-needy-man){.external_link

The 73 year old was a Vietnam veteran. He was actually the employee
giving a muffin to a homeless person.

This was in violation of store policy, and he's violated store policy on
more than one occasion. This was his fifth violation of store policy.

Cracker Barrel said the following about his termination:

> *Mr. Koblenzer has worked as a host at Cracker Barrel's Sarasota store
> since April 2011. During the time he was employed, he violated the
> Company's policies regarding consuming food without paying or giving
> away free food, on five separate occasions. Mr. Koblenzer received
> multiple counselings and written warnings reminding him about the
> company's policies and the consequences associated with violating
> them. On the fifth occasion, again per Company policy, Mr. Koblenzer
> was terminated.*
>
> *Cracker Barrel is grateful for and honors Mr. Koblenzer's service to
> our country as we honor all service men and women and their families.*

If you want to buy food and give it away, that's your business.

But you can't give away company food without paying if it violates
company policy, regardless of how kind-hearted you are.

So would I still eat at Cracker Barrel? Sure.
