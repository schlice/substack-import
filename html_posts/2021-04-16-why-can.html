**Why can't Americans understand that gun-violence numbers are inflated
to include gang violence and suicides, and that by addressing drugs,
mental health and enforcing current firearms laws, we can leave the 2nd
Amendment alone?**

I have reported your question to Quora Moderation as "Insincere." This
means you're not seeking genuine answers, but are instead making a
point.

Most Americans do understand every point you've made. There is a small
but vocal minority of Americans which, despite knowing these facts,
still believes that they can be fixed by "getting rid of guns." And it's
really difficult to change their minds.
