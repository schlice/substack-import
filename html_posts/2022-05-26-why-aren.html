In the United States, it's because of the Second Amendment.

You cannot treat guns like hazardous machinery, because the requisite
training, licensing, and regulations would be counter to the Second
Amendment, which says that the right of the people to keep and bear arms
shall not be infringed. Treating guns like hazardous machinery would be
an unconstitutional infringement on the right.

Original question:

Why aren\'t guns treated like a hazardous machinery requiring licensing
