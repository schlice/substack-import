Ah, faith. Let's discuss faith, shall we?

But first, let's look at evidence, since faith is what lies between your
evidence and your belief. If we're being brutally honest here (and I
have spent a great deal of time debating with non-theists on this site),
the problem is not with the evidence. The problem is *what evidence will
you find acceptable?*

God (if he exists) exists outside of time and space. This, of course, is
necessary if he were to have created all these things, because you
cannot exist inside your own creation unless you first existed outside
of your own creation. This means he is immaterial and timeless. So he
cannot be measured with a sensor. You'll never be able to see him with
your eyes, or touch him with your hands.

But there is more evidence that a creator god exists than there is
evidence that a creator god does not exist. So let's take a look at some
examples, as well as how much faith is required to believe each view in
light of the evidence:

1.  The scientific evidence overwhelmingly shows that the universe
    exploded into existence out of nothing. Either someone created
    something out of nothing (the theistic view) or no one created
    something out of nothing (the atheistic view). Which view is more
    reasonable? The theistic view. Which view requires more faith? The
    atheistic view.
2.  The simplest life form contains the informational equivalent of 1000
    encyclopedias in its DNA. Theists believe that only an intelligent
    being can create a life form containing the equivalent of 1000
    encyclopedias. Atheists believe that random chance and natural
    forces created that life. Theists have evidence to support their
    conclusion. Since atheists don't have any such evidence, their
    belief requires more faith.
3.  Hundreds of years before it happened, ancient writings told of a man
    who would actually be God. This God-man would be conceived in a
    specific way, born in a specific place to a specific lineage, suffer
    and die in a specific way, and then rise from the dead to atone for
    the sins of the world. Immediately after the predicted time,
    hundreds of people exclaimed and then recorded the fact that these
    events happened as they were predicted. These people gained nothing
    from their exclamations but persecution and death, which they could
    have saved themselves if they had just kept quiet. Thousands of
    people were converted when they heard this message, and this belief
    spread quickly throughout the known world. Ancient historians and
    writers confirm these events, and archaeological finds corroborate
    them. Having seen the evidence from bullet 1 above, theists believe
    that these multiple lines of evidence show beyond a reasonable doubt
    that a creator god had a hand in all of these events. Atheists need
    a lot more faith to explain away the predictions, the eyewitness
    testimony, the willingness of the eyewitnesses to suffer and die,
    and the corroborating testimony of the other ancient writers and the
    archaeological evidence.

Faith, as we mentioned earlier, is what covers a gap in knowledge. The
less evidence you have for your position, the more faith you need to
believe it. And as it turns out, atheists have bigger gaps in their
knowledge because they have far less evidence for their beliefs than
theists have for theirs.

In other words, the **empirical, forensic,** and **philosophical**
evidence strongly supports conclusions consistent with theism and
inconsistent with atheism.

So the real question is: *why don't atheists realize that they need a
lot more faith to be atheists than theists need to be theists?*
