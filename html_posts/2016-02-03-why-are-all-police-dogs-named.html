I\'m reasonably certain that not all police dogs are named \"Bach.\"

I am certain that you\'re reading too many of [[Rick
Bruno](https://www.quora.com/profile/Rick-Bruno-1)]{.qlink_container}\'s
answers and you are suffering from the \"statistics of small numbers\"
logical fallacy. Because everything you have read (on Quora) is Rick\'s
answers about his own police dog who was named Bach, you have drawn the
(mistaken) conclusion that all police dogs are named Bach.

Rick\'s next police dog (IIRC) after Bach retired was named Zeke, so
that alone confirms that not all police dogs are named Bach.
