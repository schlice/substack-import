First of all, the situations were completely and totally different. Not
only were they recorded in different states with different officers, but
we know nothing about what happened before, what happened during, and
what calls the officer was responding to. It\'s a very biased video.
Seems like a bit of an apples-to-oranges comparison. Without context,
we\'ll never know.\
\
But to address the actual concern, if you\'re asking if bigotry still
exists, it certainly does. If you\'re asking if there are bigoted police
officers, yes there are. Should the 2nd Amendment only apply to
Caucasian males? Absolutely not.\
\
But I\'ll ask you these questions:\
\
]{.rendered_qtext}

- Blacks make up 14% of the population. But they commit more than half
  the violent crimes in this country.
- The population of state prisons made up of by black men is 37.5%,
  which is far greater than their representation in the population.
- The number one cause of death for young black men is homicide. And in
  90% of cases, the shooter is another young black man.

\
So should the police ignore these statistics? And should they also
ignore the statistic that says that a cop is *six times more likely* to
be shot by a black man than the other way around? If you were that cop
rolling up onto a black man with a gun, and you knew these statistics,
would you think twice?\
\
Through all of that, the police still have to do their jobs fairly and
equitably, and they have to treat each situation as it comes, which
means they will treat every \"man-with-a-gun\" call differently. And who
else has to deal with the pressure the police do? Who else has 10 cell
phone cameras trained on him while he does his job? Do we do this to
electricians? Or garbage collectors? Or firefighters? No, only police
get recorded every time they step out of their cars.\
\
Bigotry and hatred should not exist. In a perfect world, they would not.
But our world is far from perfect, and we can only deal with it as it
comes.
