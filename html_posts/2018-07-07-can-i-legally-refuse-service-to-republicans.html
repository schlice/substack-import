As everyone has said, you can do it anywhere except for DC, where
"political affiliation" is a protected class.

However, you'll have to find a legal and *reliable* way to determine
exactly what political party a person is registered for. And since party
affiliation is not public record, I'd think you would have a very hard
time doing so.

And what if they're not registered? Or Independent? Will you refuse
service based on how they voted? That is protected information, so it's
unlikely you'd be able to find out.

The problem is that you must refuse service to *every Republican*, not
only the ones you can identify visually, or the ones who self-identify.
You must refuse service equally, or you are violating the 14th
Amendment. You must refuse service equally if you are going to do so at
all.
