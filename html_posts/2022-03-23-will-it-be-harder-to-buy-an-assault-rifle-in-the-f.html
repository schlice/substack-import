Assuming you're talking about the *classic definition of an assault
rifle* as a select-fire medium-range weapon. These days, we just call
them "full-auto rifles." No one really calls them "assault rifles." That
definition was from an obscure Army manual and the moniker didn't stick.
No one in the military uses that term.

It's already hard to buy a full-auto rifle because there are so few of
them. They are collector's pieces, and most of them *start* at about
\$10,000 to purchase, and that's for the cheap ones in bad condition.
The really good ones get ridiculously expensive, and sell for hundreds
of thousands of dollars, assuming you can find a collector willing to
part with one.

Here's the rest of the process:

Original question:

Will it be harder to buy an assault rifle in the future since you can
only buy assault rifles registered before 1986? Will it be harder
because no new assault rifles can be produced and there will be more
demand?
