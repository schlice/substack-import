**Because in this regard, the police are no different than any other
corporation or government agency.**

There are several different types of things a police officer can be
investigated for:

- Violations of department policy
- Misdemeanor or felony violations of law
- Violations of civil rights

Misdemeanor and felony violations are of course investigated by the
department, but they are *also* investigated by the District Attorney's
office. In this regard, police are subject to **double** investigations.
The police don't get to tell the District Attorney whether or not to
investigate; the DA will make that determination on his own. So it's not
like the police are involved in a shooting and claim that an
investigation took place and everything's good, and then no one else
looks at it. If there was a violation of law, the DA's office will
investigate, and the (elected) DA will be held to account if he does
not.

Violations of department policy are investigated by the department
itself. This is no different than any other corporation or government
agency, which manages violation of its own policies. If these violations
occurred, it could result in mandatory re-training,
decertification/recertification, or suspension/termination. Perhaps in a
civilian corporation, such violations would be investigated by an HR
department or a Legal department. In a police department, it is an
Internal Affairs Bureau (IAB) which investigates officers. Cases where
force is involved (which means anything from applying hands all the way
up to application of deadly force) is investigated by a Use of Force
(UOF) team, which includes command staff, the officer's direct chain of
command, HR, Legal, and Training (to determine if the officer was
following standards which were taught during training).

Violations of civil rights are investigated by the US Department of
Justice. Note that only police officers are subject to this type of
investigation; citizens are not normally independently investigated by
the USDOJ for civil rights violations.

Bottom line: a police department will investigate its own people for
violations of policy or law. Violations of law, however, are also
investigated by the District Attorney's office and potentially by the
Department of Justice. There is more oversight of police officers than
of any other government organization, including Congress.

Although, it does seem like the police are cleared of wrongdoing very
often, doesn't it? Like with all things related to the media, perception
does not make reality. With the very large number of investigations that
take place all the time, most of the time, you'll find that the police
were actually doing their jobs.

Let's put this into context. Let's say you produce 10 widgets a day at
your job. Let's say your employer launched an investigation into whether
or not you violated any company policies 10% of the time, so for every
10 widgets, you were investigated one time. I bet that for the vast
majority of the time, you would be found to be fully compliant with all
company policies. I'd also bet that after a while, you'd get tired of
hearing just how much you were in compliance with all company policies,
and it would seem like no one ever does anything wrong at that place.

This is exactly what happens with police.

Because departments are hyper-sensitive about public perception, they
investigate far more officer actions than is required, and the vast
majority of the time, the officer is found to be in compliance with
department policy, and no further action is needed. While this is
expected, it does leave the impression that when officers are
investigated, they are cleared because it happens so often.
