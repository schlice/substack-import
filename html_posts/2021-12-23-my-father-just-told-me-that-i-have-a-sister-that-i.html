You should feel however you would like to feel about that. All I can do
is tell you whether or not **I think** any one particular emotion is
useful or useless. I'll also tell you how I would advise someone who
told me this, but you can take it or leave it when it comes to my
advice.

Do you want to be angry at your father for not telling you about your
sister? You can, although that's pretty unproductive in my opinion. I
wouldn't waste my time with anger. I might also be wary about anything
my father says, since I know he's willing to lie to protect...something.

Do you want to be disappointed that you didn't get to spend all of this
time before now with your sister? Fine, be disappointed, but let it pass
quickly. Understand that the past is the past and you can't undo what
has been done. You can only work from today forward.

Instead, if I were to give you advice, I would say you should feel
*thrilled* that you have a sister, and you can meet her and learn all
about her and find all the weird little ways that you two are alike
because you're actually siblings, even though you didn't grow up
together.

I think it would be so fun to have a sister I never knew about. I would
love to meet her!
