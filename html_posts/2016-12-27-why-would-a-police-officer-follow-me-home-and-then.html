*The reason I didn\'t open the door or answer it is because he has no
legal right to come into my house without a warrant.*

That's not a reason to not answer the door. That's a reason to not let
him in the door.

*What is the next stop the cop will take? Will he just ignore this and
forget about it, or will he try to get an arrest warrant?*

We don't know because you didn't answer the door! I would think that at
the very least morbid curiosity would have made you answer the door,
just to see what he wanted. Oh well, now we'll never know.

It could have been anything, but if it was indeed something which
requires your arrest, he will be back with a warrant. Only you know what
you did.
