**Content:** [The media loves to glom on to anything that makes them
money. \"If it bleeds, it leads\" is the motto for the 6 o\'clock news.
There has been a lot of attention paid to police brutality after
Ferguson.\
\
Let\'s also clarify: if scrutiny is needed, I\'m all for it. Let\'s air
our dirty laundry, and let\'s find and address our problems.\
\
However, I will tell you this: the vast majority of police officers will
go their entire careers and never fire their weapon outside of the
range. That\'s the reality. The reality is that we have over 500,000
sworn police officers in the United States, and we\'ll have roughly 500
officer-related shootings each year. So on average, your chance as a
police officer of needing to shoot someone on duty is about 1000 to 1.
Same number said a different way, only .1% of police encounters end with
someone killed by police.\
\
The media will show you every last second of every one of those 500
encounters, and extrapolate that over 500,000 police officers are out to
kill you. Does that sound fair to you?]{.rendered_qtext}
