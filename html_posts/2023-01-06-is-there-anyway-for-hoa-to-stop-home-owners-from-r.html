Yes, it is well within the power of the Board to do this.

It can be accomplished in multiple ways. Here are just a few examples:

- Amend the Declaration of Covenants or the Bylaws to disallow halfway
  houses in the neighborhood. This will require varying percentages of
  votes by the homeowners (depending on your state and your HOA), but it
  is the most iron-clad way to do it, and it would be virtually
  impossible to challenge in court.
- Modify the Rules and Regulations to require that the Board approve any
  and all rental contracts before they are signed. This change can be
  voted on by the Board alone at a regular Board meeting, but it
  requires setting up rules for what types of rentals are "allowed" and
  what types of rentals are "disallowed." You could also add verbiage to
  say that the Board has the authority, in its sole discretion, to
  disallow any rentals if it believes that the rental would be
  detrimental to the community in any way. This also is more prone to
  legal challenge, but if it is well-written (use your HOA attorney to
  help draft the final wording of the Rule), it should be able to
  survive most challenges.

These are not the only ways you can accomplish this change. I would
recommend an interested Board contact their attorney to discuss methods
by which this behavior could be restricted in their neighborhood.
