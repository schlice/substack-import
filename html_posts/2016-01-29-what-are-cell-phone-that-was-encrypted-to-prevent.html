There are several different models of phones designed to be 100% secure
and encrypted. The most famous are from
[[Cryptophone](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2d8e80&url=http://www.cryptophone.de/en/products/mobile/){.external_link

There is also software available that you can load to your Android
device to encrypt your texts and voice calls as well.

Don\'t forget that in order to place an encrypted call, both parties
must be using the same phone.
