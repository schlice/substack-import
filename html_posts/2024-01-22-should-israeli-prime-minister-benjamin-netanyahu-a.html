Yes! Absolutely! This is what Israel has wanted for decades!

So Joe Biden wants it. Israel wants it. So what's the problem?

***Palestine doesn't want it. Hamas doesn't want it. Militant
Palestinians don't want it.***

They don't want a "two-state solution." **They want a "one-state
solution."** And guess who will live in that one state? Here's a hint:
not Jews.

It's the Palestinian's rallying cry: "From the river to the sea." From
the river (the Jordan) to the sea (the Mediterranean), means that
Palestinians will take over all of Israel and make good on their promise
to destroy all Jews.

Their other rallying cry is "Globalize the Intifada." *Intifada* in
Arabic means "uprising" or "shaking off" and in this context has been
used to describe periods of intense Palestinian protest against Israel,
mainly in the form of violent terrorism: The First Intifada from
1987-1990 and the Second Intifada from 2000-05. These periods of
intifada were marked with acts of terrorism, including suicide bombings
against Israeli civilians.

If Palestinians could live peacefully alongside Jews, Israel would allow
it. Israel would *welcome* it. In fact, in the previous two wars, Israel
offered Palestinians this very option. Agree to recognize Israel's right
to exist and live in peace, and become **full citizens of Israel**. This
is a big deal, because no other Arabs in the Middle East live free in a
true democracy. Those who took Israel's deal do indeed live free today,
in Israel. Nearly one-fifth of the population of Israel is Arab. Arabs
serve alongside Jews in the IDF. Israel welcomes **peaceful** Arabs.

But the militant Nazis who live in Palestine want nothing more than the
utter destruction of Israel. And after October 7th, which was for
context the largest loss of life for Jews since the Holocaust, Israel
has finally had enough. After decades of swatting rockets out of the
sky, dealing with Palestinian suicide bombers, and generally having the
world's worst next door neighbors, they're done. Hamas has to go, and I
don't mean go "home," because 1) they don't have a home, and 2) no other
Arab country in the region will take them.

**TL;DR:** Sure! Israel should agree to the two-state solution! But
Palestinians have to want it too, and they still don't.
