It is not illegal to send naked photos of yourself in the United States
unless you are under 18 in most states. If you are under 18, this is
considered *distribution of child pornography* and the recipient can be
guilty of *receiving* or being in *possession of child pornography*.

If you are over 18, you can still get into trouble for sending naked
photos of yourself to someone under 18. This would be considered
*contributing to the delinquincy of a minor* and if you are a person in
a position of authority, you could be charged with *abuse or
contributing to the delinquency of a minor by a person in a position of
trust.*

If the sender and receiver are both over 18, the distribution of naked
pictures is not a violation of law.
