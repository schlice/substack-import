So let me see if I understand what you are saying.

You "feel like you were cheated." Does that mean you were actually
cheated? Was a provision of your agreement not fulfilled as written? Or
are you saying that you were not represented as vigorously as you
believe you should have been?

If a provision of your agreement was not fulfilled as written, go
directly to the attorney and ensure they fulfill it.

If you simply feel you didn\'t get your attorney\'s best effort, you
don\'t have many options. You can leave a bad review on your favorite
review site like Yelp or Google. Make sure you are truthful and explain
that it is all about your feelings and not actual, articulable facts.
You don\'t want to end up on the wrong end of a libel lawsuit. You could
also seek a second opinion. You could have another attorney look over
there whole case and see if they agree that you got the best possible
outcome.
