**Because of all of the problems with voting on computers, should the
U.S. only vote by paper ballot thus leaving a paper trail making it
easier to do a recount?**

How about a combination of both?

Here in Florida, we have voting that looks like you're filling out a
"Scantron" test. Remember those? You fill in the bubble on the sheet of
paper. You then run your own ballot into the voting machine, watch it go
in, confirm your votes, and your votes are counted. The paper ballots
are retained so that you can perform recounts easily if there is doubt
as to the actual vote totals or if the race is so close that it triggers
an automatic recount.

The problem in the United States is that we don't have just one
election. We actually have 51 separate elections, and each state's rules
are different.

The most effective systems are the ones which use paper but count by
machine.
