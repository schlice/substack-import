It really depends on how you generate a valuation. If you are looking at
nothing more than the value of physical assets owned, airlines are far
more valuable, as their assets are worth far more than the assets owned
by WhatsApp.

But how do you value a software service provider? By number of users?
Delta Air Lines, [[the world\'s largest
airline](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a2ac2e&url=http://www.economist.com/blogs/gulliver/2015/06/worlds-largest-airlines){.external_link

passengers last year. WhatsApp has approximately 500 million users, so
by sheer user volume alone, WhatsApp has five times more visibility than
Delta Air Lines.

In October of 2014, Facebook acquired WhatsApp for \$21.4 billion
dollars. Delta Air Lines may have gross revenue of \$40 billion, but
they only have [[a net
income](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1e1b5c&url=http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/dal/profile){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="marketwatch.com"}]{.qlink_container} of \$4.5 billion. So in
terms of valuation, WhatsApp is clearly valued more (and has a higher
income potential) than Delta Air Lines.
