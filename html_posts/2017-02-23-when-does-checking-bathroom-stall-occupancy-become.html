*(EDIT) As with all things legal, these are state-based provisions. Laws
vary from state to state. Check with a lawyer in your area if you need
to know the specific laws where you live.*

In general, checking for feet under a stall should not be illegal. It is
not considered an invasion of privacy to see if a stall is occupied by
looking through a pre-designed hole at the floor. Most bathroom stalls
are designed with walls that do not extend completely to the floor. The
user of that stall implicitly agrees to this technical restriction when
entering the stall. Looking at feet under the stall door does not
constitute an invasion of privacy, because there is no reasonable
expectation of privacy where your feet are concerned. Simply bending
down to check for feet to see if the stall is occupied should be just
fine.

It becomes an invasion of privacy when the outside looker checks
***more*** than the feet. For example, if your feet are down, and they
are clearly visible to someone looking from floor-level, there is no
need for anyone to check occupancy any further. Someone looking in over
the top or sides, or intentionally peeking through cracks, is invading
privacy where there is an expectation of privacy.
