No. Not because he shouldn't be tortured to death, because he absolutely
should. But we, *as a nation*, should not endorse torture. We believe
that the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution is still the best way to
go forward as a nation:

> ***Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed,
> nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.***

So the "cruel and unusual punishment" section has undergone some changes
over its existence. In the context of punishment in sentencing, the
Court has generally viewed the Eighth Amendment to prohibit punishments
that "involve the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain."

Historically, this has been considered as part of the death penalty, and
that standard has been used to uphold the firing squad, and
electrocution. In other cases, the Supreme Court held that various
lethal injection protocols withstood scrutiny under the Eighth
Amendment, finding that none of the challenged protocols presented a
"substantial risk of serious harm" or an "objectively intolerable risk
of harm."

However, "torturing someone to death" is not only "unusual" meaning that
it is not something we do frequently, or even sparingly, but it is
"cruel" which has come to mean "unnecessary and wanton infliction of
pain."

So torture is off the table.

Either it's life in prison, or it's the death penalty.
