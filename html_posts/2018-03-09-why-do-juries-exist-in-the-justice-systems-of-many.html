The primary reason that we have a Sixth Amendment in the United States
is the same reason we have a Second Amendment: **resistance to
tyranny**.

Tyranny exists when absolute power rests in a single person. Thus,
governmental tyranny can exist when judges (appointed representatives of
the government) are the ones who make the ultimate decision in a trial.
This does not mean that all non-jury systems are examples of tyranny,
but they are examples of situations in which tyranny *can* exist.

Jury trials are the exact opposite of tyranny because it is *the
people*, not the government, who have the final say on what should
happen to you.
