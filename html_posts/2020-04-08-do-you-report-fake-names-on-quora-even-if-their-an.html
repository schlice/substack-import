**Do you report fake names on Quora, even if their answers are very
good?**

Yep. 100% of the time, no exceptions.

I find it *especially* irksome when someone who writes great answers
can't be bothered to follow our community rules. When [[Nikki
Grayestone](https://www.quora.com/profile/Nikki-Grayestone)]{.qlink_container}
says that Quora is ultimately a collection of quality answers, what
about the answers makes them quality? Besides the content and writing
style, the only thing that distinguishes quality answers here from
quality answers on *literally any other site on the Internet* is that
**authors here personally represent and reinforce the quality of the
answers they write** by stating specifically who they are.

Remember the Orville Redenbacher commercials from the 70s? "You\'ll like
it better or my name isn\'t Orville
Redenbacher."[\[1\]](#zRtNT){#cite-zRtNT .citation_link} Even now,
people stand behind the quality of their words, and their works, with
their name. Quora expects us to do no less.

And that is a massive brand differentiator for Quora. It's our job to
help reinforce that.
