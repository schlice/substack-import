First, please cite one example of "Florida" telling people they don't
need to be vaccinated. I'll wait. Florida is doing pretty well
considering they are the third largest state in terms of population.

Second, the cases of mucormycosis (aka "black fungus") are not caused by
COVID-19 or a variant.

When a patient is critically ill with COVID-19, they will sometimes
receive corticosteroids to reduce inflammation. But they also reduce
immunity, which is allowing a very rare fungal infection to occur.

So it's not COVID-19 causing the infection. It's the treatment for a
rare critical case of COVID-19 causing the conditions to be ripe for
someone to get a ***secondary infection***.

Original question:

Why is Florida telling people they don't have to get vaccinated, when
there is a new variant that causes black fungus, which eventually eats
your face offðŸ˜³? Do you want your face eaten by fungus?
