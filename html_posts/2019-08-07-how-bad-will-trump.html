**How bad will Trump\'s dementia have to get before the 25th amendment
is invoked?**

Understanding the letter of the law, Trump would have to be unable to
discharge the duties of the office of President, as observed by the Vice
President and the Cabinet.

Note that I did not say "unable to discharge *well*" or even "unable to
discharge *effectively.*" I said "unable to discharge."

The whole purpose of the 25th Amendment is for it to be used when the
President is incapacitated to such a degree that he can't function as
President.

For example, if he breaks his leg and is confined to bedrest, he can
still function as President. The 25th Amendment can't be invoked.

However, the President can *voluntary cede the office to the Vice
President* until he is back on his feet, if he believes that he is
unable to do the job.

Therefore, for the 25th Amendment to be invoked, the President must be
*so far gone* that he can't even respond to verbal questions.
