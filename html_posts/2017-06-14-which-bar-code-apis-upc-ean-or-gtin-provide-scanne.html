To be fair, you shouldn't be providing all of that information in a bar
code. They simply can't hold enough information. I would suggest using
your bar code to link to a website. Since most "bar codes" (which are
really 2D codes today) are easily read on smartphones, you're best
served by producing a QR code which sends the user to a mobile website.

If you do want to include an image, several formats will be able to hold
enough information to produce an image, such as PDF417 and QR.
