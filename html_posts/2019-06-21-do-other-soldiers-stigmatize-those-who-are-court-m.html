**Do other soldiers stigmatize those who are court-martialed but not
convicted?**

I don't think so.

I do think that if someone has gone though a court-martial and came out
unscathed, it would remain as an item of concern in the back of my mind.
I don't think it would change what I think of that person, but it might
change *how* I think about that person.

If the military says they can stay, they stay, and we accept them,
period. That doesn't mean I have to go have a beer with him after work
though.
