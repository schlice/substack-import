**Should tampons be banned considering they\'re a form of reverse rape
and reinforcing patriarchy?**

I'm not even going to address anything equating tampons and rape. It's
like comparing apples to phone booths. The logic is so far off it hurts
my brain.

Reinforcing patriarchy? You really think it's *men* that *force women*
to use tampons? Only if using bandages on a bleeding cut is reinforcing
the matriarchy.

If a woman wants to use a tampon, she has the freedom to do so. If she
doesn't want to use a tampon, she certainly is under no obligation to do
so. No one forces her to do so, and there is no "tampon culture" which I
am aware of that pressures a woman into using a tampon, other than her
own sincere desire to not bleed all over her clothes.

So no, tampons should not be banned. If you don't want to use them,
don't buy them.
