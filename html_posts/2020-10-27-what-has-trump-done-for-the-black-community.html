**Has President Trump done good things for the black community?**

Depends on what you consider "good things." I'm a conservative, so I
think that if I have more opportunities to earn my keep, that's a good
thing.

And Trump *absolutely did that* for the black community.

- Under Trump's economic plans, black unemployment (pre-COVID) was at
  its lowest recorded levels ***in history***. Not just in this term.
  Not just in the last decade. ***Ever. Since they have been recording
  black unemployment numbers.***
- Trump has contributed *more money than asked for* to HBCUs
  (historically black colleges and universities). HBCUs are colleges and
  universities which were established before the Civil War which were
  created to primarily serve the black community.
- Trump was instrumental in creating Opportunity Zones:

> Since being enacted by President Trump, nearly 9,000 Opportunity Zones
> have been designated across the Nation, encompassing nearly 35 million
> Americans.
>
> As of the end of 2019, Opportunity Zones have attracted \$75 billion
> in funds and driven \$52 billion of new investment in economically
> distressed communities, creating at least 500,000 new jobs.
>
> Private equity investments into businesses in Opportunity Zones were
> nearly 30 percent higher than investments into businesses in similar
> areas that were not designated Opportunity Zones.
>
> As a result of these new investments, approximately one million
> Americans will be lifted from poverty.[\[1\]](#VIRsK){#cite-VIRsK

- But he did more. Rather than just creating Opportunity Zones and
  forgetting about them, he directed federal agencies to prioritize
  their locations inside distressed areas, including Opportunity Zones.
  In the past, the federal government located facilities in central
  business districts. Doing this further enhanced Opportunity Zones
  without increasing costs to taxpayers.

So I'm not sure what you consider to be "good things for the black
community," but if you consider more opportunities for higher education,
more jobs, and more money in your pocket to be a good thing, then that
answer should be yes.

grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,
downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora
is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply
going to comment to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" then you're
the reason why I disable comments. Well done, Karen. You ruined it for
everyone.*
