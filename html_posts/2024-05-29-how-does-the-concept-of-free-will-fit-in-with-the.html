This is actually a far more nuanced question than critics make it out to
be.

First of all, since God exists outside of time, He sees everything
differently. For God, everything is **now**. The past is **now**. The
present is **now**. The future is **now**. God literally sees all of it.

But that ability to see everything *alone* does not limit our ability to
make free choices.

The difficulty comes when we try to understand this within God's
framework. *If I haven't made the choice*, they reason, *then how could
God possibly see what I will choose?* *And if God sees it, then it means
I've either already made the choice, or I must choose the path that God
sees, and therefore I don't actually have free will!*

The truth is that yes, human beings have the ability to choose to do
anything they have the ability to do.ยน But the concept of free will is
*fraught*, because I never really truly have free will. My choices are
always influenced by something.

Even before we talk about whether or not God influences our choices,
*we* influence our choices. Our history influences our choices. Our
*destination* influences our choices.

Jonathan Edwards, in his book *The Freedom Of The Will*, says that free
moral agents always act according to the strongest inclination they have
at the moment of choice. In other words, we always choose according to
our inclinations, and we always choose according to our strongest
inclination at any given moment. So for example, if I asked you, "Why
are you sitting in that chair right now?" you would be able to analyze
your current situation and determine why you are actually in that chair
right now. It might be, "because I'm at my computer," or "I always sit
in this chair, so I just chose this one," or "this is the only chair in
the room," or "I got tired of standing, so I sat in the nearest chair."

The point is that even choices which seem free actually have some form
of motivation, regardless of how small. The difference is that ***we***
are making that choice, without any outside coercion.

But what if there *is* outside coercion? Do you still have free will?
Can you still make choices? What if a robber holds me at gunpoint and
says, "gimme your wallet and your phone right now or I'll kill you"? You
have far *fewer* choices at that very moment, but you would indeed still
have choices, and you can still choose any of them. You'd think your
only choice would be to hand over your wallet and your phone, but that's
not true. You could choose to fight, saying "well, I have cancer, so I'm
going to take the chance that I can fight him off, and maybe I get shot
and maybe I don't, but I don't care." So even when we have very limited
choices, we are still able to make choices.

So ultimately, we have a paradox. Every choice we make is **free**, and
every choice we make is simultaneously **determined**. We are both free
and determined. R.C. Sproul holds this view as well; an appeal to irony.
Initially, it would seem that the concept of *free will* and
*determinism* are flatly at odds: if my choices are determined, then
they are not free. But my point is that our choices are ***always***
determined by something. At this point, most people would say, "yeah,
but as long as ***I*** am the one making the choice, then I am free." So
the answer is that most people equate free will with
**self-determination**.

And if that's true, if my choices stem from my disposition and desires,
and if my actions are the consequences of underlying causes and reasons,
then it is my personal desire that, in a very tangible way, dictates my
personal choices.

**But if my desires dictate my choices, are they truly free?** I would
even go so far as to say that if it is true that you *always* make the
choice which correlates to your strongest desire at that very moment,
then *your choices are never truly free*, because they are always
determined by something. You will always choose according to your
strongest desire, so your choices are always determined.

***So when we talk about "free will," what do we mean?***

The classic argument says that if God already knows what I will choose,
then I must make that choice because God has already seen the choice; I
cannot choose otherwise.

*So couldn't it be possible that God knows your* ***desires****, so He
knows what you will choose because He knows what your strongest desire
is, and what your strongest desire will be?*

The answer is yes, He can know. He can know what you think and what you
desire. Therefore, He can easily know what you will choose, not just
because He has seen you make that choice (even though He has), but
because He knows your heart, and He knows what you will choose, even if
you think you haven't made the choice yet. He knows what you will
choose, because we always choose in accordance with our strongest desire
at that very moment.

\

ยน In specific, humans can't choose to do things that are outside of
their nature. For example, I can choose to walk across a bridge. I can
choose to skip across a bridge. I can choose to ride a bike across a
bridge. But I cannot choose to flap my arms and fly across a bridge,
because I cannot fly. So I can only choose to do things that I am able
to do.
