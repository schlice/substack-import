**Content:** [Let me repeat what I think I read so you can see if I
understand you correctly.\
\
You see notifications in Facebook that your friends are using a
particular app, and you\'re wondering about the privacy violations that
the app is committing on your friend\'s behalf.\
\
When you install an app, you have the option to \"connect it to
Facebook.\" *This is the opt-in*. Once you have completed the OAuth
login, Facebook tells you what the app wants to do. First, it tells you
what kind of information it wants from your Facebook profile (i.e. your
name, your birthday, your friend list, etc), and you have the option to
approve/disapprove that interaction with your profile. Then, Facebook
will ask you about what the app wants to do with your timeline (i.e.
Facebook would like to post on your behalf). Generally, when it says
this, it means that using the app, you will be able to share items
directly to Facebook, but in order to allow that, Facebook has to allow
the app to post for you.\
\
So in this way (OAuth, approving your personal account access, and
approving the interaction with your timeline), you have given the app
*carte blanche* to post whatever relevant information it wants to your
Facebook timeline, including to let all your friends know what kind of
cool new app you are using.\
\
Just clicking \"yes\" to User Agreements without reading them and
understanding what\'s in them will lead you to ask questions like \"why
is App X invading my friend\'s privacy\" when all the while your friend
actually allowed the app to post to Facebook (three times, to be
precise).]{.rendered_qtext}
