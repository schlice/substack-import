The article doesn't say that at all.

The article doesn't say that "Trump will force department stores to say
Merry Christmas." What the article says is that Trump stated:

> \"They don\'t use the word Christmas because it is not politically
> correct,\" Trump said, complaining that department stores will use red
> and Christmas decorations but say \"Happy New Year.\" \"We\'re saying
> Merry Christmas again.\"
>

> \"You go into a department store. When was the last time you saw
> \'Merry Christmas?\' You don\'t see it anymore,\" Trump said on the
> campaign trail. \"They want to be politically correct. If I\'m
> president, you will see \'Merry Christmas\' in department stores,
> believe me, believe me.\"

Note that he doesn't say *how* he plans on getting department stores to
say Merry Christmas, but if I had to venture a guess, it would be by
example. He will probably champion the causes of those whom he believes
are being discriminated against because of their faith. He will probably
use the term himself. He will probably also stand behind people who are
attacked because of their religion, and stunningly in America, this is
mostly directed at Christianity, not the oft-maligned Muslim:

> Attacks on the expression of religion in the "public square" of
> government and public property, land, and buildings are not recent.
> For many years, those opposed to crosses and monuments in public
> places have attempted to use the courts to have these displays
> declared unconstitutional, often under Establishment Clause grounds.
> However, zealous atheist groups increasingly have focused their
> hostility on private religious expression which is only very tenuously
> connected to government. They have continued to harass small towns and
> localities which merely maintain the traditions handed to them
> involving years of public prayer, displays of religious history on
> public buildings, or crosses on veterans' memorials. Often, not
> knowing any better and lacking proper counsel, localities capitulate
> to the demands of those hostile to any public expression of
> faith.[\[1\]](#JYngh){#cite-JYngh .citation_link}

He will probably also attempt to pressure businesses to allow their
employees to use whatever seasonal greeting they choose. He will likely
face a great deal of push-back for that, but if NFL players can express
personal opinions while they are at work and not be fired for it, why
can't a Macy's employee say "Merry Christmas" to a customer as they
leave the store?
