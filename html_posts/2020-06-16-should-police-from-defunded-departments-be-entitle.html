**Should police from defunded departments be entitled to career
retraining funds and programs? To which fields of employment does your
average officer have transferrable skills?**

Of course they should, just as any person whose company goes out of
business should. For what reason would you deny them access to such
programs?

Police officers have many transferrable skills. They could do direct
transfers into private security (which is what will replace police if
you do manage to get rid of them---police for the rich, none for anyone
else). They could transfer into corporate security offices. They could
do armed courier jobs. There\'s lots of possibilities.
