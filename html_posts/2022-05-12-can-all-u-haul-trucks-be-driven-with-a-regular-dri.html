Yes.

Some of the older 26â€² trucks I've rented have had the millenial
anti-theft device installed (also known as a manual transmission), but
more recently, they've updated their fleet with automatic transmissions.
To that end, anyone in the US with a regular driver's license can drive
any of U-Haul's trucks.
