**Why do Starbucks baristas ask if you "want room" when I order "black
coffee"? Are they not taught that "black coffee" literally means, "I
don't need any room for cream"?**

It could be as simple as the fact that you order black coffee because
*you want to do your fixings yourself at the little fixing station*
instead of letting them do your fixings.

Additionally, when people don't ask for room and then take their black
coffee to the fixing bar, they will *dump coffee into the trash to make
room for their cream.* This makes a mess for employees to clean up, and
if the bag happens to have a hole, it leaks out onto the floor. You can
imagine what kind of mess that makes.

Isn't it better that someone ask to clarify rather than assume and get
it wrong?
