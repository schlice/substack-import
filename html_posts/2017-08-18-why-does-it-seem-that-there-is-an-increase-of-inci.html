Have you noticed that ISIS has claimed responsibility for all of these
vehicle attacks? No surprise; they *told their followers how to do it!*

*Fun fact:* **ISIS publishes a magazine.**

In a previous issue, they had an article detailing how to "mow down"
people using large vehicles. The article describes pickup trucks, but
the idea is the same. Once the article filtered down to the terror
cells, they started working up plans to kill and injure using vehicles.
Hence, the uptick in terror attacks using vehicles.

Guess what was in their latest issue? How to attack a passenger train,
replete with maps of the most heavily used rail lines in America,
notably the line between Manhattan and Washington, DC.

Amtrak better read that article *really closely.*
