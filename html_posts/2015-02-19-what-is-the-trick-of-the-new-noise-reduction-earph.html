**Content:** [The headphones that are included with your phone are
trying to strike a balance between \"decent earbuds\" and \"the least
expensive option we can bundle in with the phone.\"\
\
These particular headphones use a noise reduction technique called
\"noise-isolation,\" as opposed to the more sophisticated
\"noise-cancelling\" method.\
\
Noise-isolating headphones aim to block the entire ear canal and fill it
with rubber. Your headphones pictured use silicone rubber earpieces to
close out the entire ear canal to isolate the ear canal. That way, there
isn\'t any foamy earpad that allows sound to get in, and you get a good
fit with the rubber buds fully enclosing the ear canal. These work best
when pressed into the outer part of the ear canal.\
\
Noise-cancelling headphones are different. They use external microphones
that listen to waveforms that exist outside the headphones, and they
broadcast an equal but opposite waveform into the audio path, which
effectively cancels out the external noise. Noise-cancelling earbuds are
identified by external battery packs, an on-off switch, and usually an
indicator light of some sort, as well as microphones near the buds
themselves (to listen to the outside noise). Prices vary depending on
additional features. An example of these would be these Audio-Technica
ATH-ANC3 noise-cancelling earbuds:\

You might want to look for more \"active\" earbuds, like these Philips
ActionFit earbuds, which have a built-in earhook:\

Earbuds like these are extremely comfortable to wear and won\'t fall out
during activity. They still use the small rubber earpieces which sit
just inside the ear canal, so they still are noise-isolating, but these
are far less likely to fall out of your ears. As a matter of fact, once
you seat these, really the only way to get them off is to take them off.
