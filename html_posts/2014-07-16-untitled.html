<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [Bill, oddly enough, I agree with you on this point. We
spend far too much effort focusing on everything but the criminal, and
it\'s time we do that.\
\
When I was at the Academy (Air Force, not police), an offense which
involved alcohol was considered an \"alcohol incident\" and required a
mandatory 6-month alcohol counseling and 6-month restrictions. The
kicker was what constituted an offense which involved alcohol. Something
so lowly as having an empty beer can in your car when you were pulled
over for a broken tail light constituted an alcohol incident, even if
your BAC was 0.0%. Sound a bit extreme? Guess who got slapped with
alcohol incidents: people who were actually doing something wrong and
drinking. No one else dared step across that line because the penalty
was too steep.\
\
We need to treat guns the same way. A \"firearm incident\" should raise
whatever crime was originally charged to a class III felony and carry a
mandatory sentence, which should initially include some jail time.
Multiple offenses should include much more jail time. Even if there is a
gun in the car when you run a red light, you could be charged with a
felony because the gun makes it a \"firearm incident.\" Many poor
drivers would think twice about carrying a gun. Or breaking the law. Who
wants to become a felon for being stupid?\
\
I am no big fan of mandatory sentencing, but this is a lot like the
\"three-strike rule\" which I am in favor of. One time can be an
accident. Twice can be pure stupidity. Three times rises to the level of
intent required to remove reasonable doubt. Mandatory sentencing takes
some crimes out of the hands of judges and juries and puts those
punishments in the hands of the people. Firearms crimes should be
similarly treated, and \"firearms incidents\" will make more criminals
think twice about jumping the turnstiles with a gun in their backpack.\
\
But to combine my answer and Cliff\'s, when a homeowner leaves his
weapon unsecured or fails to report a theft like he detailed, that
should also be a \"firearm incident\" and carry the same penalty.
Criminals should bear the responsibity for what they do, and gun owners
should bear their own share of responsibility as well.]{.rendered_qtext}
