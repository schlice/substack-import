<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [Bill, oddly enough, I agree with you on this point. We<br>spend far too much effort focusing on everything but the criminal, and<br>it\'s time we do that.\<br>\<br>When I was at the Academy (Air Force, not police), an offense which<br>involved alcohol was considered an \"alcohol incident\" and required a<br>mandatory 6-month alcohol counseling and 6-month restrictions. The<br>kicker was what constituted an offense which involved alcohol. Something<br>so lowly as having an empty beer can in your car when you were pulled<br>over for a broken tail light constituted an alcohol incident, even if<br>your BAC was 0.0%. Sound a bit extreme? Guess who got slapped with<br>alcohol incidents: people who were actually doing something wrong and<br>drinking. No one else dared step across that line because the penalty<br>was too steep.\<br>\<br>We need to treat guns the same way. A \"firearm incident\" should raise<br>whatever crime was originally charged to a class III felony and carry a<br>mandatory sentence, which should initially include some jail time.<br>Multiple offenses should include much more jail time. Even if there is a<br>gun in the car when you run a red light, you could be charged with a<br>felony because the gun makes it a \"firearm incident.\" Many poor<br>drivers would think twice about carrying a gun. Or breaking the law. Who<br>wants to become a felon for being stupid?\<br>\<br>I am no big fan of mandatory sentencing, but this is a lot like the<br>\"three-strike rule\" which I am in favor of. One time can be an<br>accident. Twice can be pure stupidity. Three times rises to the level of<br>intent required to remove reasonable doubt. Mandatory sentencing takes<br>some crimes out of the hands of judges and juries and puts those<br>punishments in the hands of the people. Firearms crimes should be<br>similarly treated, and \"firearms incidents\" will make more criminals<br>think twice about jumping the turnstiles with a gun in their backpack.\<br>\<br>But to combine my answer and Cliff\'s, when a homeowner leaves his<br>weapon unsecured or fails to report a theft like he detailed, that<br>should also be a \"firearm incident\" and carry the same penalty.<br>Criminals should bear the responsibity for what they do, and gun owners<br>should bear their own share of responsibility as well.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/As-a-gun-owner-is-there-any-compromise-youre-willing-to-make-in-the-name-of-reducing-gun-violence-Why/answer/Cliff-G-13<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
