**Money can buy happiness, but only up to a certain point.**

Numerous studies have found that there is a dollar-for-dollar increase
in happiness (or reduction in negative emotions) up until about
\$70,000. Then, as dollars increase, the reduction in negative emotions
decreases, up to a zero reduction at around \$200,000.
