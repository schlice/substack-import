Woody Allen once said, "If you want to make God laugh, tell him about
your plans."

What does that mean? It means that **you're not in control, God is.**
God will not alter His plans because of something you want. God's plans
are God's plans; they are not alterable. You cannot alter God's plans.
You cannot affect God's punishment for sin.

That said, as others have told you, do not enter into promises lightly,
and don't make promises that you cannot keep.

Let me ask you this: when you made your promise to God, *what did He
say?* Did He say, "Okay, I'll accept that promise and alter my plans for
you"? Based on the number of times God has altered His plans when humans
have asked (exactly zero), I think that this is not how He answered you.
He likely said, "Good intentions, but no, I won't be making that
promise."

Try this instead:

Instead of telling God what you're going to do, and expecting Him to
follow your plan, ask God to reveal His plan to you, and to help you to
come alongside Him and participate in His plan.

Because no matter what you say, God is God, and He is going to
accomplish His plans in your life. Ultimately, you'll be better served
if you start trying to adapt yourself to God's plans rather than
persisting in trying to have God change His plans to fit you.
