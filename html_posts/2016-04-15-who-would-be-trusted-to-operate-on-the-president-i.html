The [[White House Medical
Unit](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=078fa9&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Medical_Unit){.external_link

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} is the organization which
oversees the medical care of the staff and visitors to the White House.
It is run by a Director, who is also the Physician to the President,
currently CAPT Ronny L. Jackson, USN. So to answer your question, this
is the man who would operate on the President.

The WHMU is staffed by military physicians, physician assistants,
nurses, and medics. They travel with the Presidential Advance Team as
well as with the President aboard Air Force One and Air Force Two. AF1
has a full surgical suite aboard that WHMU surgeons can use.

If the President needs medical care that cannot be provided by WHMU, he
will be airlifted to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where
Dr. Jackson would work with the team to care for the President.

The First Lady also travels with a WHMU physician, but she does not
travel with a mobile surgical suite.
