Palisade cell adaptations are the specific adaptations in a palisade
cell to allow it to better conduct photosynthesis. From
[[Wikibooks](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f8a19b&url=https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/A-level_Biology/Central_Concepts/Photosynthesis%23Palisade_Cells){.external_link

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikibooks.org"}]{.qlink_container}, the specific adaptations
are:

> - Large Vacuole - Restricts chloroplasts to a layer near the outside
>   of the cell where they can be reached by light more easily.
> - Cylindrical Arrangement - They are arranged at right angles to the
>   upper epidermis, reducing the number of light-absorbing cross walls
>   preventing light from reaching the chloroplasts. This also allows
>   long-narrow air spaces between them, providing a large surface area
>   for gaseous exchange.
> - Movement of chloroplasts - Proteins can move the chloroplasts within
>   cells to absorb maximum light.
> - Thin cell walls - to allow gases to more easily diffuse through
>   them.
