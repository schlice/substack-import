**Content:** [Believe it or not, America is probably one of the easiest
countries to naturalize into (even with all of our immigration
problems). It is not easy to naturalize into another country; most
countries\' immigration rules are far more strict than ours. It\'s not
as easy as telling someone, \"You don\'t like it here? Leave!\" Where
would they go? There really is no place in the world that is \"easy\" to
emigrate to.]{.rendered_qtext}
