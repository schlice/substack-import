**Content:** [I cannot say specifically for the Delta flight that
skidded off of the end of the runway at LGA on 5 Mar 2015, but I can
tell you what is normally done at airports to maintain runways.\
\
The \"snow crew\" are airport employees who augment the normal runway
maintenance crew at airports that can receive significant snowfall. They
will drive the large plows to clear the runways, and they usually drive
in a wedge formation simultaneously to clear the runway in the fastest
and most efficient manner possible.\
\
They will also use large truck-mounted snow throwers to remove the snow
from the runway and into the infield. Additionally, they will use large
truck-mounted rotary brushes to help keep the snow off the runways.\
\
Funny side story, my best friend at the Academy told me a story about
his former enlisted days at Plattsburgh AFB in upstate New York. It
would snow so much that the snow mound in the infield would last until
July. They used to call it \"Mount July\". One day, they decided to play
a prank on an unsuspecting Airman; a newbie. They wrapped a can of
hydraulic fluid (which is red) in a BDU blouse (a military shirt) and
buried it in the snow. When the poor guy drove the 10K-mounted
snowthrower into the package, he got a BDU blouse and a whole lot of red
snow out the chute. Poor guy turned as white as the (other) snow.\
\
Because of the risk of foreign object damage (FOD), they do not use
sand. They can pre-treat the runway with anti-icing chemicals before the
snow falls, but if the snow falls fast enough or if the temperatures
decline fast enough, the chemical will not be as effective.\

(EDIT) [[Christopher

makes a good point, the aircraft is essentially still flying when it
touches down and for some time after, until there is no longer enough
airflow over the wings to generate lift. During that time, the aircraft
normally uses thrust reversers to slow the speed of the aircraft. By the
end of its landing roll, it will use wheel brakes, but the majority of
the decel is done by thrust reversers. Again, we don\'t know what
happened to the Delta flight in New York yet; a full investigation will
reveal why the aircraft departed the end of the
runway.]{.rendered_qtext}
