**I realize that wearing your seatbelt is the law, but how many people
do you think actually wear it though?**

It's a stupid law. Government is not my nanny. If I want to kill myself,
that's my business. Government should not be passing laws to stop me
from killing myself.

Despite what [[Gregg
Gray](https://www.quora.com/profile/Gregg-Gray-1)]{.qlink_container}
contends, laws which simply exist "because it's good for you" make bad
law. Laws should be in place to protect *me* from *you*. Laws should not
be in place to protect *you* from *you*.

Now, there are some practical reasons why a driver should be required to
wear a seatbelt. It holds you in place in the event of an accident so
you can continue to control the car and you'll be less of a hazard on
the road that way. It's also conceivable that people flying around the
interior of the car could be a distraction to the driver during an
accident, so they should be belted as well.

The state does have a vested interest in the well-being of children, so
laws requiring anyone under 18 to be buckled, even over the objections
of stupid parents, are also good laws.

But forcing people to wear seatbelts because it's "safer?" Government is
not my nanny. If I want to risk my own life by skydiving, drinking a 32
oz Coca-Cola, or not wearing a seatbelt as a passenger in a car, that's
my business and no one else's, especially not the state. My insurance
company may want to know about these things, but the state does not have
a vested interest in my personal safety. They may have an interest in
the safety of consumers at large, so they may mandate that all cars have
required safety equipment available and that roads are constructed
safely. But laws which protect me from me are bad laws.

In practice, most people wear seatbelts all the time. It's an easy habit
to get into and it is arguably safer to wear them.

There shouldn't have to be a law to make me do so, though.
