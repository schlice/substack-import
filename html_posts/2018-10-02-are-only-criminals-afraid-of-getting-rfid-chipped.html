**Are only criminals afraid of getting RFID chipped? I'm a good guy and
try not to knowingly commit crimes, so why should I be against being
chipped?**

No one should be afraid of getting a RFID chip implanted under their
skin. The tags that work under the skin have a very short read range,
typically up to about 18 inches away from the skin. This is true because
the chip is very small. Small chips are only able to collect a small
amount of radiation with which to return a signal back to a reader, and
therefore only work reliably at short distances. Subdermal chips are
easily deactivated by any anti-radiation material being placed directly
over them.

Granted, there are some special-use RFID readers and chips which can be
read at greater distances, some up to 1500 feet away, but these are
typically "active RFID" chips which are powered, broadcasting units.

Disney's MagicBands are an example of both types of RFID chips at work.
It contains both a passive, short-distance RFID chip, and an active,
powered XID chip. The RFID chip is a small, passive, short-distance
chip, and is used for personal identification. It is employed in payment
systems, hotel room door systems, and "Fastpass" ride access systems,
systems that you wouldn't want to be used over longer distances (i.e.
you don't want to be paying for the guy's drink in front of you). The
XID tag, being a locally powered "active" chip, is readable at a much
greater distance, and can essentially identify every person within the
park (a boon for the "lost child" business). It also provides
"value-added" features, like taking a photo or video clip of a ride
vehicle and automatically attaching it to the accounts of every person
on that ride vehicle.
