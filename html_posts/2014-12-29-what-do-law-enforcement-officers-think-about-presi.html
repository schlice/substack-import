**Content:** [[[The Bureau of Justice
Statistics](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=71a913&url=http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty%3Dtp%26tid%3D71){.external_link

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"

500,000 sworn peace officers in the United States. Funding 50,000
cameras touches barely 10% of the officers in the US. So if he wanted
body cameras on every sworn officer, he would have needed to fund ten
times the amount of cameras he did.\
\
This is purely a token effort by the government to show that they are
\"doing something\" without actually doing something.\
\
It will still be up to local departments to actually fund cameras for
their officers, since this funding will only get cameras for 10% of
their officers.\
\
(ED) I think that the biggest problem departments will face is not the
actual cameras themselves. It is funding the infrastructure the
department will need to store, manage, and retrieve the video.
Additionally, while the funding may buy the initial round of cameras,
there is still a \"serviceable life\" that a camera has, plus you have
to account for actual wear-and-tear and breakage during normal use.
Until the cameras get into regular use, we won\'t know what the actual
service life of a camera is. It could be as high as 30% of the cameras
in a year needing replacement, and the funding doesn\'t take that into
account.\
\
Additionally, we are talking about **petabytes** of data that must be
stored. The actual amount of data that is stored is dependent on several
factors (how long must non-evidentiary recordings be stored, how often
are officers required to record their public interactions, etc). The
longer department policy requires cameras to be running, the more
storage space will be required to store the videos, and the longer
departments keep non-evidentiary recordings, the more space is required.
While most non-evidence recordings can usually be deleted after 90-180
days (which is what privacy advocates would like), people can bring
complaints against officers any time, and it would have been nice to
have the video of that contact that you just deleted. Most departments
are not opting for cloud-based storage, as the security isn\'t well
defined enough, so all the data will have to be stored in-house.\
\
Beyond just the data storage hardware (which is expensive enough), most
departments do not have dedicated Storage Admins on staff, and will have
to get approved and budgeted a new tech position just to handle ops data
storage (at \$70-\$110K per year). Dash-cam recordings are much smaller
and don\'t run all the time in all departments.]{.rendered_qtext}
