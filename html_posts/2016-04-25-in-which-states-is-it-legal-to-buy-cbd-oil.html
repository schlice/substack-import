It is legal in any state in which you can buy cannabis. If you meet the
requirements to buy cannabis, you can buy CBD oil.

The requirements vary by state. Some states allow medical marijuana,
which requires special permission from the state, and the requirements
for each state differ. Some states have decriminalized possession of
small quantities of marijuana. And two states (Washington and Colorado)
have made recreational possession legal. Check [[the
