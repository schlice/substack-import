**Content:** [This sort of technology is currently in existence. We have
\"net guns\" and \"bean bag guns\" that can be used without hurting
someone.\
\
Some people won\'t be stopped by these technologies. And the use of one
of these, in lieu of deadly force, will still leave the police and the
public vulnerable to the use of deadly force.\
\
So the real question is: do you think that it is appropriate to use
lethal force against someone who is a threat to a police officer and to
the general public? Is there a line that you would draw below which you
could \*not\* use lethal force? Would you universally say that Michael
Brown should not have been shot simply because he was unarmed? Does
\"unarmed\" equal \"not dangerous\" in your eyes?\
\
I might also add that a TASER is a less-than-lethal weapon, just as a
slime gun is. Until the slime gun malfunctions, or a suspect chokes on
the slime and dies, or the suspect slips in the slime and falls down and
breaks his head open and dies. Does that make the slime gun a lethal
weapon? No more than it makes a TASER a lethal weapon, and it still
hurts.\
\
A slime gun is big and awkward (you need a big tank of slime to spray).
When I can wear a slime gun on my belt like a TASER, I\'ll look at it as
a possibility.]{.rendered_qtext}
