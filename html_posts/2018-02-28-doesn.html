**Doesn\'t it make the public lose trust and respect for law enforcement
when police as blatantly violate traffic laws and park illegally when
clearly not on call, including speeding and parking in handicap spots?**

First, police vehicles are not classified as "motor vehicles" in the
vehicle and traffic laws of almost every city and state in the country.
They are classified as "emergency vehicles" and are therefore not
subject to those regulations. Have you ever seen a parking ticket on a
police car? You can't, because they are not classified in the same way
as motor vehicles which are subject to traffic laws.

That said, there are always department rules regarding where vehicles
should park and where they shouldn't. Usually, departments avoid parking
cruisers in marked handicapped spots and instead will park in a fire
lane or in a similar "No Parking" location, for reasons which we'll get
to.

Secondly, police officers need quick access to their vehicles if they
get an emergency call. If you were trapped in a building and needed
police to respond quickly, would you want the police officer to have
quick access to his vehicle to respond as fast as possible, or would you
rather have him make his way out to a parking spot and contend with all
of the headaches of negotiating a parking lot rather than responding to
your call? Because they need rapid access to their vehicles, they often
park in areas which would be illegal for you to park your own personal
car.

If this practice makes you lose respect for the police, it's only
because you don't have a clear understanding of why it happens.
Therefore, the loss of respect is your problem, not the police officer's
problem.
