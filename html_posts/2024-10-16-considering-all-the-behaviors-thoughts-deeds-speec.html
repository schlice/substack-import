Things don't "qualify" as sins. They either are sinful, or they are not.

Are we, as fallible humans, always committing some kind of sin? Well,
depending on how aware we are of our own behavior patterns, we may be.

But the truth is that regardless of the frequency, we are all sinners.
We have all "fallen short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23). We all
sin, in our thoughts and in our words, in what we have done, and what we
have failed to do. We are living in sinful bodies in a fallen, sinful
world, so sin is virtually inevitable for us.

If we are ignorant of our sin, then we haven't done the work necessary
to reveal those sins, and if we haven't done that, have we truly
repented?

The good news is that we can discover our sin! The Holy Spirit can help
to reveal those sins to us, ***if we ask***. So pray to have your sin
revealed to you, the sin that you may have committed that you aren't
even aware of. Prepare yourself for the surprise of revelation.

But then, ***repent*** of that sin. And keep it in mind so that you can
***avoid*** that sin in the future.

Then, repeat this exercise to make sure you're catching it all.

We shouldn't allow unrepented sin to exist in our lives. We should be
making an effort to discover that sin and to repent of it.
