While it is true that 18 USC 2252 requires a visual depiction, state law
may still prohibit the audio file possession.

Additionally, even at the federal level, possession of the audio file
may qualify as "constructive possession" of the video file, or may
simply prove the exploitative act, both conditions could be used to
prosecute.

If you're instead talking about an audiobook which is a verbal
description of an exploitative act, this may be considered *obscenity*
and may also be illegal to transmit via the Internet.

Original question:

Is it illegal to listen to child pornography? For context, I\'m arguing
with a guy who insists it\'s legal as long as it\'s audio-only.
