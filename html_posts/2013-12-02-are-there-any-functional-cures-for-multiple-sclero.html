**Content:** [EDIT: I have been thinking more about this and I wanted to
append (prepend?) my answer. You asked if there was a \"functional
cure\" for MS. This is not a term generally used for MS, it is more
commonly associated with HIV. In that field of study, the definition of
\"functional cure\" means no further viral evidence present without ART
(anti-retroviral therapy), no disease progression, and no disease
transmission. To compare this to MS, one would be \"functionally cured\"
if there was no further disease progression, no further disease activity
(i.e. no new/active lesions), and no further relapses, all without
taking any of the approved disease modification therapies available. So
based on that definition, as of this writing, there are no functional
cures for MS. The current batch of immunomodulators does not halt
disease progression, they merely slow it down. They do not eliminate
exacerbations, they reduce their severity and duration. And all evidence
points to the fact that ceasing immunomodulator therapy leads to
increased disease activity. We can treat the disease, not just the
symptoms, and this is a huge step from where we were just 20 years ago.
We can make peoples\' lifespans nearly match their non-MS counterparts,
and we can improve the quality of life for people with the disease.
However, we need a much greater understanding of the disease itself and
its origins before we can approach a functional cure.\
\
Your leaky gut theory holds water (no pun intended), as one of the most
recent treatments for MS, natalizumab (marketed as Tysabri) is thought
to work by preventing auto-immune cells from passing through the
blood-brain barrier into the spinal fluid, and also into the intestinal
cavity. Tysabri is used as a treatment for MS as well as Crohn\'s
disease.\
\
At over 60%, Tysabri has a higher efficacy rate than any other approved
MS therapy on the market today.\
\
Does this lend credence to your theory? I will let you
decide.]{.rendered_qtext}
