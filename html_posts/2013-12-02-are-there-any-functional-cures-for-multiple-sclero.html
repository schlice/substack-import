<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br>(https://www.quora.com/topic/Multiple-Sclerosis)]{.qlink_container}?]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [EDIT: I have been thinking more about this and I wanted to<br>append (prepend?) my answer. You asked if there was a \"functional<br>cure\" for MS. This is not a term generally used for MS, it is more<br>commonly associated with HIV. In that field of study, the definition of<br>\"functional cure\" means no further viral evidence present without ART<br>(anti-retroviral therapy), no disease progression, and no disease<br>transmission. To compare this to MS, one would be \"functionally cured\"<br>if there was no further disease progression, no further disease activity<br>(i.e. no new/active lesions), and no further relapses, all without<br>taking any of the approved disease modification therapies available. So<br>based on that definition, as of this writing, there are no functional<br>cures for MS. The current batch of immunomodulators does not halt<br>disease progression, they merely slow it down. They do not eliminate<br>exacerbations, they reduce their severity and duration. And all evidence<br>points to the fact that ceasing immunomodulator therapy leads to<br>increased disease activity. We can treat the disease, not just the<br>symptoms, and this is a huge step from where we were just 20 years ago.<br>We can make peoples\' lifespans nearly match their non-MS counterparts,<br>and we can improve the quality of life for people with the disease.<br>However, we need a much greater understanding of the disease itself and<br>its origins before we can approach a functional cure.\<br>\<br>Your leaky gut theory holds water (no pun intended), as one of the most<br>recent treatments for MS, natalizumab (marketed as Tysabri) is thought<br>to work by preventing auto-immune cells from passing through the<br>blood-brain barrier into the spinal fluid, and also into the intestinal<br>cavity. Tysabri is used as a treatment for MS as well as Crohn\'s<br>disease.\<br>\<br>At over 60%, Tysabri has a higher efficacy rate than any other approved<br>MS therapy on the market today.\<br>\<br>Does this lend credence to your theory? I will let you<br>decide.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
