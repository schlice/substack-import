**Someone is coming into my house with a key when I\'m away. Calling the
police doesn\'t help; neither does speaking to the owner of the building
nor using video equipment. What can I do to end this madness?**

It's easier to beg for forgiveness than to ask for permission.

Your solution is simple. Hire a locksmith and change the locks. Do not
ask for permission, just do it. Then give a copy of the key to the
landlord. In most cases, landlords don't care if you change the locks,
as long as they have a copy of the key.

End the madness. Change the locks.
