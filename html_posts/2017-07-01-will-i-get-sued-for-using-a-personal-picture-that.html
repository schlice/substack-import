Looks like you complied with his request, and you worked with Google to
the best of your ability.

Let him know what you did. Let him know the results of talking to
Google. Even if he does decide to pursue legal action, I think you\'ll
be covered.

Of course, if he does decide to sue, get a lawyer.
