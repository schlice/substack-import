**Yes**.

*Every Christian has their own "brand" of Christianity*, because every
Christian has a unique and individual relationship with God. No two
Christians worship, pray, or believe exactly the same.

And for the ancillary issues, that's really not too terrible. So long as
the core beliefs are all there, we can discuss and debate the rest, in a
healthy, affirming way (an art form that this generation seems to have
lost).

And *some Christians conform completely to every doctrine of their
denomination.* Some, however, do not. Would it surprise you to learn
that, in any one given Christian church, only about *half* of the
congregants are saved? You probably didn't expect to hear that!

The truth is, despite how hard we try, not all congregants are walking
together in lock-step. It would be nice if every single Christian in
that room completely conformed with every doctrine of the denomination,
*for their sakes, not ours*. We will still be preaching the Gospel and
praising God whether they are saved or not. We hope that our prayers and
our songs penetrate those stubborn minds and turn those people to Christ
so that they too can be saved. That is our great desire.
