**What\'s the status of the eight senators from both parties who asked
Trump to explain by April 13 the "clear, substantial reasons for
removal" of the Intelligence Committee Inspector General Atkinson? It\'s
now April 14 and I haven\'t seen anything.**

The status? The Senators are still waiting for answers. Hopefully
they're not holding their breath.

The Senators have no authority to compel the Executive to explain his
personnel decisions. Just as the President has no authority to compel
the Senators to explain why they hire and/or fire personnel on their
staffs, Congress has no oversight over Executive branch staff decisions.
Trump could literally fire someone because he doesn't like how they
smell, and Congress has no authority to demand any explanation.

They can "request" an explanation, and if the President chooses, he can
give them one. Or not.
