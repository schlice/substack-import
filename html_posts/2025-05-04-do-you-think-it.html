If you're wondering whether it's time, you probably are out of time.

In nearly every jurisdiction, there is a ***statute of limitations*** to
bring a legal action against a government official. In other words,
regardless of your claim, you have a limited amount of time to bring an
action against a public official for civil rights violations. So that
time has probably already expired.

But even if it hasn't, the police are protected by ***qualified
immunity*** for official actions they take as part of their duties. The
Sheriff is an elected official and has state-mandated duties that he
must perform. He cannot be sued for taking part in those activities.

And even if he is successfully sued, the result is a fine, not prison
time. You would have to accuse him of committing a crime, and to do
that, you need the help of a lawyer. And if you're asking people on
Quora for advice, it's unlikely you have an attorney.

So the chance that the Sheriff in Knoxville (the Knox County Sheriff)
will be arrested and put in prison lies somewhere between slim and none.
