What a great question, thanks for asking!

So, let's first clear up some misconceptions you clearly have:

- The Spirit will never "leave you." As the Spirit is God, and God has
  stated plainly that he will never leave us or forsake us, we can
  presume that the Spirit will never leave us.
- That said, it is possible to get ourselves into a state of mind where
  we convince ourselves that we have done something "beyond redemption."
  You said that you "messed up way beyond repentance," and this just
  isn't a thing. **There is nothing you can do that can separate you
  from the love of God**.
  - The LORD is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in
    love. He will not always accuse, nor will he harbor his anger
    forever; he does not treat us as our sins deserve or repay us
    according to our iniquities. For as high as the heavens are above
    the earth, so great is his love for those who fear him; as far as
    the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions
    from us. --- Psalm 103:8--12 NIV

Once you realize that nothing can separate you from the love of God, you
can begin to repent of your sin. I'm certain that whatever you did was
not directly in conscious countervention of God's commands. i'm sure you
didn't think to yourself, "I know what the right thing is, but I'm going
to do the wrong thing anyway." You made a mistake. Mistakes are a
patently human thing to make. God understands this. He understands we
make mistakes.

Now, it's time to do what he commands: "Go, and sin no more." It's time
to "go," or move on with your life, don't get hung up on this, "and sin
no more," or **repent** for what you have done. Turn away from your sin
and your sinful desire. Make a conscious effort to avoid that in the
future.

Then know that you will feel the presence of the Spirit again. Remember,
God never left you. He was there with you the whole time. You just got
yourself into such a state that you couldn't hear his voice or feel his
presence.

Original question:

How do we know if the holy spirit has left us? I have a feeling I messed
up way beyond repentance. because I haven't felt the spirit in me in 6
months no matter what I do or pray.
