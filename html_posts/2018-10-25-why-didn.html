**Why didn\'t Trump protect reporter Jamal Khashoggi in spite of Obama
pleading and advising him to?**

In what universe is President Trump (who happens to be the president of
*the United States*) responsible for the security of a *non-US citizen
while outside the United States?*

*Even if Khashoggi was a US citizen,* the White House does not routinely
protect any other US citizen, either. If I flew over to Saudi Arabia and
walked into the Saudi Arabian embassy, I wouldn't expect the President
to send SEAL Team 6 (or any other SEAL team, for that matter) along with
me.

Khashoggi was an adult. He was also a Saudi citizen. He was free to
leave the country (where he was staying as a guest) and return to his
country of origin.

At best, Trump could have passed on Obama's warning. Heck, Obama could
have skipped the middle man and warned Khashoggi himself. He probably
did.

But Khashoggi, being an adult, went anyway.

I'm not sure what you really expected was going to happen here.
