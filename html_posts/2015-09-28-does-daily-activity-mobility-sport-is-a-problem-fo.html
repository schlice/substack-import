**Content:** [For the majority of MS patients, problems with movement
are not quite as common as some other symptoms like fatigue. Known as
\"MS Lassitude,\" fatigue hits about 80% of people with MS. Movement
issues can actually be exacerbated with fatigue.\
\
Walking (gait) issues are the most frequently reported movement issues
with MS. There are several factors that contribute to gait issues,
including weakness, spasticity, loss of balance, sensory deficit and
fatigue.\
\
Walking issues can be helped by physical therapy, assistive therapy
(such as electromuscular stimulation to help combat foot drop) and
medications such as Ampyra. Ampyra was the first drug designed
specifically to treat a symptom of MS.]{.rendered_qtext}
