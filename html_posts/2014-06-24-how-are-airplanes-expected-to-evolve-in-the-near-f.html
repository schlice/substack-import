**Content:** [We are already seeing some of that evolution with the
\"Internet of Things\" (IoT) and the \"Big Data\" movement. Airplanes
will continuously be sending \"telemetry\" data back to their
maintenance offices, which are receiving and processing that data. This
data shows all of the aircraft\'s flight characteristics as well as the
performance of all of the aircraft\'s key systems, because the IoT has
sensors in nearly every component, and they all send real-time data.
What does all that mean? It means that instead of replacing parts
**after** they break, a maintenance facility can monitor an aircraft and
see the telemetry data that shows what a part is doing **just before**
it is going to break. This way, they can have the part ready at the
aircraft\'s next stop, and they can have the part replaced. The end
result will be ***the elimination of unplanned downtime of aircraft.***\
\
Another innovation you will start to see is more automation. With more
collision avoidance systems becoming smarter and more interconnected
with other aircraft systems like guidance systems, you will see aircraft
not only guided by GPS, but aircraft interconnected with each other so
that they will make ***automated course corrections***. ATC will not
need to manually correct aircraft courses as aircraft will all be in
digital communications with each other and can make course corrections
as needed. ATC can input system-wide course corrections around specific
locations, and the system will allow for aircraft to update their
courses around these locations. \"Filing your flight plan\" will become
as simple as inputting your destination into the system when you take
your seat. In a few seconds, your flight plan is downloaded to your
system and is on file with ATC.]{.rendered_qtext}
