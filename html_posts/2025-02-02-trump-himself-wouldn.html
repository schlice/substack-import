Starting off your question with an incorrect assertion is usually not a
good start. You absolutely can be an air traffic controller with a
felony conviction, **so long as the conviction was not for alcohol or
drug charges.**

> **but he gets to author the standards by which all air traffic
> controllers are hired**

Well, not exactly. It's the FAA who authors those standards. Yes, he is
the *de facto* head of the FAA, since it is an Executive branch
administration, and he certainly has a great deal of input into what
rules are implemented, but no, he does not write that regulation.

Now, no one is claiming that DEI actually caused the crashes we
experienced. But it is an open secret in the aviation industry that some
DEI initiatives could have potentially led to a lowering of standards in
certain situations, particularly when qualifications were closely
matched between candidates. The fact that DEI was even a factor in
hiring is what may have potentially led to a less qualified candidate
being hired. The FAA, for its part, denies that standards for air
traffic controllers were ever lowered. But again, there's that open
secret about airline hiring practices related to DEI initiatives...

> **he\'s 2 weeks in office & 67 people are dead, are the skies safe?**

The short answer is "it's too early to say." It appears that the
helicopter crash was pilot error on the part of the helicopter pilot,
and the Philadelphia crash was catastrophic aircraft failure caused by a
fire on board. Until we know more, we can't really say how preventable
those crashes were and whether or not any administration policies would
have even made a difference.

Let's be patient and let cooler heads prevail for a while.
