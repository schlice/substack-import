Because having an opinion isn't illegal (yet).

Aiding and abetting (thankfully) has an *actual legal definition* which
must be satisfied in order to charge someone with this crime. In
general, *aiding and abetting can be charged when someone helps someone
else commit a crime.* Now be aware, laws vary by state, but this is a
pretty solid definition:

> A person charged with these accomplice crimes is usually not present
> when the crime itself is committed, but he or she has knowledge of the
> crime before or after the fact, and may assist in its commission
> through advice, actions, or financial support. Depending on the degree
> of involvement, the offender\'s participation in the crime may rise to
> the level of conspiracy.[\[1\]](#mwpkX){#cite-mwpkX .citation_link}

So just looking at the general definition of the crime of aiding and
abetting, you can probably see that a *supporter of a political party*
is not "aiding and abetting a criminal" simply by supporting a political
party or position. In order to be charged with the crime, a person had
to:

- know that the crime was going to take place
- assist with the crime, usually through some action (and giving money
  is considered action). Giving advice on how to commit the crime is
  also covered.

Anyone who knew or aided the protesters in unlawfully entering federal
property could be charged with aiding and abetting in the crime of
unlawfully entering federal property.

But if you still believe, to this day, that the group of rioters on
January 6th was trying to take over the government, you need to move out
of your parent's basement.

Original question:

Aiding and abetting a criminal act is in itself a criminal act, after
January 6 2021 attempted overthrow the United States Government, why
aren\'t his supporters indicted and for prosecuted aiding and abetting
after the fact according to federal law?
