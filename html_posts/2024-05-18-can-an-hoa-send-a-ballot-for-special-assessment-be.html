We cannot answer this question. If there are restrictions in your
Governing Documents (the CC&Rs, the Bylaws, or your Rules), then perhaps
you have a complaint.

And if there is nothing in your Governing Documents, and nothing in
local or state law laying down any requirements, then it's likely that
the Board has no obligation to do what you're asking.

You might find it helpful before you vote on the special assessment to
have them, but if it's not in your Governing Documents, you may not be
able to force them to do so.
