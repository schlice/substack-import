**Content:** [*PLEASE NOTE: We\'re going to talk about some very
hot-button issues, and the media has conditioned you to think that any
time we speak about these, they are instantly \"racist.\" Relax, I\'m
not racist. But in order to discuss these things, we have to tread into
area that is generally considered \"racist.\"*\
\
*Are we past that now? Good. Let\'s get to the meat of the issue.*\
\
\
\
Great question, and very timely. Thank you for asking.\
\
There are two major problems that feed into why young black men don\'t
change their perceptions of themselves:\
\
1. **A culture in the black community that values underachievement.**\
\
Jason L. Riley, a columnist with the *Wall Street Journal*, recently
published a book called *Please Stop Helping Us: How Liberals Make It
Harder for Blacks to Succeed.* He talked about his book in a speech he
gave recently:\

\
Statistics bear this trend out. Eighty percent of black kids in New York
public schools are performing below grade level. And a big part of the
problem is a black subculture that rejects attitudes and behaviors that
are conducive to academic success.\
\
Another big part of the same problem is a reluctance to speak honestly
about these cultural shortcomings. Racism has become an all-purpose
explanation for bad black outcomes, be they social or economic. If you
disagree and you\'re white, you\'re a bigot. If you disagree and you\'re
black, you\'re a sell-out.\
\
If we\'re going to talk honestly about this subject, we have to look at
the violence in black communities. Blacks constitute about 13% of the
total population, but they commit more than half of the murders in the
United States. The black arrest rate for most offenses is typically two
to three times their representation in the population. So long as blacks
continue to commit a larger than average amount of crime, they are going
to be perceived suspiciously and tensions between the races will
continue. If we want this to change, we\'re going to have to talk about
how to change the behavior that drives these perceptions.\
\
2. **A Democratic party that is willing to support the false narrative
that racism is the cause of any bad black outcome.**\
\
The Left in this country play a big part in keeping blacks from helping
themselves, by sticking to the same tired explanation that all bad black
outcomes are because of racism, and we have to \"help\" the black man to
overcome it. Otherwise, he will never improve his lot in life. Looking
specifically at what you asked (the high rates of black violence in
America), the Left would like to blame this on lots of different things
which have nothing to do with the real cause:\

- *Poverty and racial tensions.* Back in the 40\'s and 50\'s, when
  racism was legal and blacks were far poorer than they are today, the
  black crime rate was lower.
- *\"The system.\"* Blacks have long been a part of running that system.
  Some of the most violent cities in this country in the 70\'s and
  80\'s, Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, and Cleveland, were run by
  black mayors and black chiefs of police. Some of the most violent
  cities today are run by blacks.
- *Over-policing of black neighborhoods*. The Left would love for you to
  believe that blacks are dying at the hands of cops, when this
  couldn\'t be farther from the truth. A cop is six times more likely to
  be shot by a young black man than the other way around. 98% of black
  shootings don\'t involve police at all. The number one cause of death
  for a young black man is homicide, and in 90% of those cases, the
  shooter is another young black man. The rate at which blacks are
  arrested is nearly equal to the rate at which blacks are identified by
  victims as their assailants. The police are in those neighborhoods
  because that\'s where the 911 calls are coming from, and young black
  men are being killed by other young black men, not cops.\
  \

If the Left really wanted to change these trends, they should be
focusing less on their tired narratives, less on \"racism,\" and more on
the attitudes in the black community towards school, work, marriage,
parenthood, and raising children. Black boys without a father are 68%
more likely to be incarcerated than those with a father. The likelihood
of teen pregnancy, drug abuse, dropping out of school, and other bad
social outcomes increases dramatically when a father is not around.
Political scientist James Q. Wilson said that if crime is to a
significant degree caused by weak character, if weak character is more
likely among children of unmarried mothers, if there are no fathers who
are willing to help raise their children, acquire jobs, and protect
their neighborhoods, if boys become young men with no preparation for
work, if school achievement is a sign of having sold out \-- if all of
these things are true, then the chances of reducing the crime rate among
low income blacks anytime soon is slim.\
\
Blacks ultimately have to help themselves. They have to develop the same
attitudes and behaviors and habits that other groups had to develop to
rise in America. And to the extent that a social policy, however
well-intentioned, interferes with this self-development, it does more
harm than good. The Left continues to trumpet these social policies
intended to \"help\" the black community, when all they do is create a
\"learned helplessness\" that keeps blacks ultimately as perpetual
victims. This does nothing to help them! Asked by whites in 1865 what to
do for freed black slaves, Frederick Douglass said, \"I have had but one
answer from the beginning. Do nothing with us! \[\...\] If the apples
will not remain on the tree of their own strength\...let them
fall!\...And if the Negro cannot stand on his own legs, let him fall
also. All I ask is, give him a chance to stand on his own legs.\"
Douglass was basically saying give blacks equal opportunity, then leave
them alone. Booker T. Washington also said that it\'s important and
right that all privileges of the law be granted to blacks, but it is
vastly more important that they be prepared for the exercise of those
privileges.\
\
They both understood that government needed to ensure that equal rights
were assigned to blacks, but they also understood the limits of
government benevolence. Blacks have to meet the challenge of being in a
position to take advantage of those rights. The history of 60\'s liberal
social policies is mostly a history of ignoring that advice.
