You make it sound like the "goals" were written by the people who
established the Christianity religion to try to force an agenda or
something.

The goals you're talking about were established by God. Jesus talked
about them in the Sermon on the Mount. Here's just a few examples:

> "You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'You shall
> not murder, and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.' But I
> tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother or sister will be
> subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to a brother or sister,
> 'Raca,' is answerable to the court. And anyone who says, 'You fool!'
> will be in danger of the fire of hell.

> "You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery.' But
> I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already
> committed adultery with her in his heart. If your right eye causes you
> to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to
> lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into
> hell. And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and
> throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than
> for your whole body to go into hell." --- Matthew 5:21--22,27--30 NIV

*WHAT???* If I'm angry with my brother, I'm going to hell? If I even so
much as *look* at a woman lustfully, I'm going to hell? And now He's
talking about self-mutilation??? No one can meet these standards!

**And that's exactly the point.**

No one can meet these standards. *On their own*. Without God, no one can
meet these standards. Christ gives us a way out, because on our own,
we're doomed. God's standards are just too high for us to achieve
without His grace and forgiveness.

Then you said that we "feel guilty" for not reaching them. And that's
true too. Our sin convicts us. We do feel bad about sin. It's part of
the process. It helps us understand when we have done something wrong
and we need forgiveness. In time, we learn to recognize the signs
*before* we sin. But it is a process; it's not instantaneous. The
process of *sanctification* is the process by which we are made, over
time, to be more like Christ.
