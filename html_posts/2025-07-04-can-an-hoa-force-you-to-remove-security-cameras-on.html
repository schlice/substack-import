Probably not. This gets a little dicier if you live in a condo, but in a
single-family home HOA, it's unlikely the HOA would succeed in this
action. The only exception would be if there are state or local laws
which restrict security camera use.

In the absence of any state laws which may restrict camera usage, you
have a right to use security cameras to secure your property, *even if*
it incidentally captures neighboring properties. So long as you have a
valid use for your cameras (and securing your own property is a valid
use) and the cameras are *generally* pointed at your property (not
directly at your neighbor's property), it is a legal use of your
cameras.

The HOA would only have a case if their Governing Documents gave them
authority to regulate camera usage, OR if your cameras were *so
obtrusive* as to become an aesthetic/landscaping issue.

But if you're using standard consumer grade security cameras mounted on
your home pointing at your property, it's unlikely the HOA would succeed
in a legal challenge to get them removed.

I still suggest you reach out to a lawyer in your area who specializes
in HOA law to be certain before you openly defy the HOA. Good luck!
