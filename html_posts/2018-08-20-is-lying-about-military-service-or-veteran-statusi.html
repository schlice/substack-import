**Is lying about military service or veteran status...i.e. \"Stolen
Valor\" illegal?**

No. You may tell anyone you like that you're a military veteran, even if
you're not. You can even wear a military uniform if you like. All
protected by the 1st Amendment.

Once you try to wear your uniform into Starbuck's and get 10% off of
your latte because you're "military," you've committed fraud.

In short, so long as you do not financially benefit from your lie,
you're allowed to lie about being military.
