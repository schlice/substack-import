**Aside from the issues with Dr. Christine Ford, did Justice Brett
Kavanaugh lie to the Senate Committee about other aspects of his life?**

"Objection your honor, assumes facts not in evidence."

You assume, just as the opinion piece from the Trib does, that Kavanaugh
lied. There is not nearly enough evidence to reach that conclusion.
