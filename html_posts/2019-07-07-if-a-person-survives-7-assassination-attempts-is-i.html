**If a person survives 7 assassination attempts is it a sign that he/she
needs to start carrying a handgun?**

Not even close.

- If a person survives seven assassination attempts, it's a sign that
  they need to improve their security posture.
- The decision to start carrying a handgun for personal protection is a
  very, er, personal one, and involves many factors, only one of which
  being the level of perceived threat a person faces.

Assassination attempts are part and parcel of being a controversial
public figure. There are always going to be whackadoodles out there, and
"haters gonna hate," so it's natural that nearly every controversial
public figure is going to face assassination attempts.

But the level of threat against an individual is only one factor which
should play in to whether or not anyone should start carrying a handgun.
For example:

- Do I have the time, money, and motivation to train to the extent
  needed to effectively carry and use a handgun in my own defense?
- Have I thought about what taking a life means? Have I thought through
  the potential consequences?
- One of the things we say in the concealed carry world is, "every
  bullet you fire has a lawyer attached to it." Am I prepared for the
  legal **nightmare** that is certain to follow any time I may have to
  use deadly force?
- Do I have the temperament to be able to undertake this responsibility?
- Can I increase my security posture (i.e. improving my situational
  awareness) without seeming like my own whackadoodle?

The decision to carry a firearm is certainly one that is not to be taken
lightly. And the perceived threat alone is just one factor which must be
weighed before deciding to carry.
