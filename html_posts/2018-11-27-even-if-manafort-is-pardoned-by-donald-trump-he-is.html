**Even if Manafort is pardoned by The Donald he is still open to state
crimes.**

This is accurate. Even if Manafort receives a Presidential pardon after
his sentencing, he is only pardoned from Federal crimes. New York
indicated that even if he was pardoned, they would pursue state tax
evasion charges. Manafort is a Virginia resident, but he owns a condo in
New York, so he may still be vulnerable to charges there. He could also
be vulnerable to Virginia's state tax evasion laws, although there isn't
a clear indication that they would be pursuing such charges.

**How is this likely to play out?**

The short answer is we don't know. We do know that Mueller essentially
ripped up Manafort's plea agreement yesterday (Monday, 26 Nov 2018).
This essentially says that Manafort simply cannot tell the truth, and
that Mueller has solid evidence to show that Manafort lied following
entering into his plea agreement. Mueller told a Federal judge that he
\"will file a detailed sentencing submission to the Probation Department
and the Court in advance of sentencing that sets forth the nature of the
defendant\'s crimes and lies, including those after signing the plea
agreement.\" Basically, Mueller knows the lies Manafort told after he
signed his plea deal, and he's going to let the court know exactly what
happened.

What we don't know is who Manafort was lying to protect.

Based on what we know about Paul Manafort, my guess is that he was lying
to protect himself. He's already lied to try to protect himself once;
there's no reason to think that he's doing otherwise now. Manafort has
already been found guilty in Federal court. He has pleaded guilty to
additional crimes. He broke his own cooperation agreement by lying. I
think Manafort is just physically incapable of telling the truth, and
he's going to spend the rest of his life in prison.

I don't think this has anything to do with the promise or even the hint
of a Presidential pardon. I think Trump has made his opinion on Manafort
very clear. He believes that Mueller has been pressuring people to lie
in order to "get him." Rudy Giuliani, one of Trump's lawyers, has hinted
at the possibility that Trump could still pardon Manafort based on how
this all plays out. But if he was trying to get himself a pardon, why
did he cooperate in the first place? Why didn't he just refuse to
cooperate? Wouldn't that be a better sign to Trump if that was what he
was going for?

So is Manafort a congenital liar, or is he a martyr? Is he banking on a
Presidential pardon? Until Mueller plays his hand, we really don't know.

(EDIT) [[Steve

pointed out a fascinating conspiracy theory in the comments which points
to another possibility for Manafort's behavior. It's actually a fairly
well known conspiracy theory, but because I don't put much stock in
conspiracy theories, it was mostly unknown to me.

[[FACT CHECK: Could a Case Currently Before the Supreme Court Result in
a Stronger Presidential
Pardon?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5d41ce&url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-gamble-court-case/){.external_link

So the theory goes like this:

- Trump fought hard to get Kavanaugh in to this SCOTUS session.
- During this SCOTUS session, a case is being heard, *Gamble v. United
  States*, which challenges the constitutionality of being tried for the
  same crime at both the Federal and state level. Currently, a Federal
  crime and a state crime which both cover the same offense are
  considered two separate offenses under the "separate sovereigns"
  doctrine. Currently, it is an exception to the double jeopardy rule.

  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
  qt-tooltip="yalelawjournal.org"}]{.qlink_container} in the *Yale Law
  Review*, "as long as two offenses are defined by different
  jurisdictions, they cannot constitute the 'same offense.'"
- If Kavanaugh and the other conservatives on the court find for Gamble,
  this would mean that a Presidential pardon from a Federal crime would
  also mean that a state could not charge that individual for the same
  crime, so he would be completely pardoned from any Federal and state
  crime.
- Trump can then pardon Manafort and Michael Cohen after their
  sentencing and they would be completely free; they would not be able
  to be charged at a state level.

While I think the chain of conspiracy is a bit thin, it is yet another
possibility, however slight, that Manafort could be praying for.
