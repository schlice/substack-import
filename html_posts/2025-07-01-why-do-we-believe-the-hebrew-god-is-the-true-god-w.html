The Bible is *about* one tribe in one region. But it wasn't *written* by
one tribe in one region. In fact, the writings about that one tribe in
that one region were written *hundreds of years before* the existence of
that one tribe in that one region. And then, the things that were
written about that one tribe in that one region...actually happened, in
exactly the way that those ancient writings foretold.

This is called **prophesy**. It is one of the **miracles** which prove
that the Abrahamic God (the more proper term for what you called the
Hebrew God) is the **one and only** God.

Then, as if that wasn't enough evidence, more ancient writings foretold
the coming of a man who would ***actually be God.*** This man-God, it
was foretold, would be born in a particular city from a particular
bloodline, suffer in a particular way, die at a particular time, and
rise from the dead to atone for the sins of the world. Immediately after
the predicted time, multiple eyewitnesses proclaimed and later recorded
that those predicted events had actually occurred. Those eyewitnesses
endured persecution and death when they could have saved themselves by
denying the events. Thousands of people in Jerusalem were then converted
after seeing or hearing of these events, and this belief swept quickly
across the ancient world. Ancient historians and writers allude to or
confirm these events, and archaeology corroborates them.

This is more **prophesy**, and is yet another illustration of the
**miracles** which are *signs* of God which authenticate the *message*
of God.

Given the prophesy, the eyewitness testimony, the willingness of the
eyewitnesses to suffer and die, and the corroborating testimony of the
other writers as well as the archeological finds, it becomes very
difficult to believe that this was just a case of really good human
writers. This type of thing can only be an example of something with
*supernatural* (i.e. outside of the natural) origin.
