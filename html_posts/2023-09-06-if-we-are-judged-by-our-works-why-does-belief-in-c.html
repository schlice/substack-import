This is a really valid question.

If we are judged by our works alone, *then why did Christ have to die?*
If we are the sole reason we go to Heaven, then there was no reason for
Christ's sacrifice. Our efforts would be what gets us to Heaven, nothing
else.

So there must be something else besides our works.

The answer is **we do not gain salvation by our works.** We are indeed
judged by our actions, but our *salvation* is a gift from God. It is not
conditioned on the presence or absence of our good works.

**Salvation is by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone.**

**Once we are saved**, our good works flow from that salvation. Our
works *demonstrate God's love* to the world. In other words, *salvation
begets works; works do not beget salvation.*

Now, that's not to say that someone who is not saved cannot perform good
works. You can perform good works both before and after you are saved.
The point is it's not the works that get you the salvation.

> For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith---and this is
> not from yourselves, it is the gift of God---not by works, so that no
> one can boast. --- Ephesians 2:8--9 NIV
