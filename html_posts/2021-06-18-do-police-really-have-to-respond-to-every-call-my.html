No, police are actually under no obligation to respond to any call. I
mean, it's a bad look if they don't respond at all, but nothing says
that you must get a response from an actual sworn police officer. There
are volunteers who also work for the department, and they're called
different things in different departments. Some departments call them
"community service officers" and some call them "community patrol" but
what they are is a group of unarmed civilian volunteers who handle a lot
of lower-level work which doesn't necessarily require a sworn officer to
attend to. They may be involved in gathering evidence for an
investigation, or assisting with traffic flow following an accident
(their vehicles, while coming from the same source of police cruisers
and usually painted with the same or similar paint scheme \[albeit
usually different colors to distinguish them from police cruisers\],
will normally only have orange light bars and traffic directors).

The "trespassing rooster" call might be handled by a community service
officer instead of a sworn officer, leaving the sworn paid officers to
handle the higher-severity calls.

Eventually (and this is the dangerous part), you can be labeled as a
"nuisance caller" and much like the Boy who Cried Wolf, even your
actually-urgent calls may fall on deaf ears (or at least muffled ears).
Your calls will certainly be treated with skepticism as to their actual
urgency, and that's never a good thing.

Worse, if the police *do* respond and it turns out there was no
emergency, you can face charges of abuse of the 911 system, or worse.

Do police really have to respond to every call? My neighbors are
harassing me and are friends with the local police- and police recently
spent over two hours investigating an alleged \"trespassing rooster\"?
