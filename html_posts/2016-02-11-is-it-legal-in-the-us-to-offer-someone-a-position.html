The answer, of course, is \"it depends.\"

**Health insurance** coverage was most recently affected by the
Affordable Care Act (ACA). Employers were required to comply with the
Employer Shared Responsibility (ESR) provisions of ACA by 2016 if they
have 50-99 full time employees or FTEs (full-time equivalents), or by
2015 if they have 100 or more full time or FTE employees.

To determine whether or not you qualify for coverage, and when you get
it, you must determine what category of worker you are:

- full-time employee (or FTE)
- variable-hour employee
- seasonal employee

If you are a full time employee or FTE, which means that at the time
that you start working for the company, you are expected to work 30
hours a week or more (or 130 hours per month) the employer must offer
health benefits starting on the first day of the fourth month.
Essentially, this means that for all regular employees, there is a
90-day grace period at the beginning of your employment where the
employer (of appropriate size) is not mandated to provide health
coverage. But starting the first day of the fourth month of employment,
you must be covered.

Note that this only applies to health insurance, and it only applies if
you know that the employee will be working more than 30 hours per week.
If the employee is a variable-hour employee and you do not know whether
or not they will work 30 hours per week at the time they start working
(a variable-hour employee), or they are a seasonal employee who you also
do not know whether or not they will be working 30 hours per week,
coverage does not have to be offered on the first day of the fourth
month. There is a completely separate computation for such employees,
and health coverage may not start until 13 or 14 months into employment.

**Other benefits** (i.e. 401(k) participation, vacation accrual, stock
purchase plan, etc) are not covered under the law, and are all
considered part of an employee\'s \"total compensation\" which is
negotiated between employer and employee as a condition of hire.
