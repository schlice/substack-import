Every denial has a process to appeal. Use the appeals process. They will
have to prove the lie that is on your background.

If that doesn't work, it's time to get a lawyer to help you.

What can I do when a police put a lie on your background that stop you
from getting a gun permit I have no felony I have nothing on my
background but that what they put on there and its not true I can prove
