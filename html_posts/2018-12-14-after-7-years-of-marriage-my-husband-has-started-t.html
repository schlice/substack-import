**After 7 years of marriage, my husband has started talking to his
girlfriend. What should I do?**

Look, we can speculate all day about why he's talking to his
ex-girlfriend again. So let's not do that.

The only way you're ever going to know is if you **talk to him**. Tell
him you know that he's talking to his ex-girlfriend, and you're
concerned. Is he unhappy with your marriage? Is there something missing
in your marriage that he may be looking for from his ex? Is there
something that you're doing/not doing that is concerning to him?

Talking to him is not "admitting weakness" or anything of the sort. It's
you working to save your marriage. Open, honest communication is the
only thing that will save a marriage.
