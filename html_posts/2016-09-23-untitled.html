**Content:** []{.rendered_qtext}

There isn't enough support to amend the constitution, and there isn't
constitutional precedent to support overturning DC v. Heller, so I don't
think that changing the law is going to disrupt anything.

Besides, changing the law doesn't answer the question about how to
disrupt the industry. Disrupting an industry refers to technology that
is "game-changing," not changing the environment.
