**Content:** []{.rendered_qtext}

But we have a system of "justice," not a system of "retribution." If
this was a Christian nation, we might follow the "eye for an eye" method
of the Bible. But we are not; we have a system of justice in our nation.

Justice means many things, but what it does not mean is "getting your
pound of flesh." Justice does not equal retaliation.
