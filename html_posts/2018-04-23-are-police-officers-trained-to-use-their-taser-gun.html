**Are police officers trained to use their taser gun before they fire
their real gun at a suspect?**

Most certainly not.

When you drive a nail, are you trained to try to drive the nail with
your hand first, before you use a hammer? Of course not, because the
hammer is the right tool for the job.

The Taser is appropriate for some situations. The firearm is appropriate
for some other situations. Situations that require a Taser do not always
escalate to situations which require a firearm. Similarly, not all
situations which require a firearm must begin with a Taser.

The firearm is deadly force. If a situation calls for the use of deadly
force, the firearm is used. If a situation does not call for the use of
deadly force, the firearm is not used. The Taser may be used. Another
less lethal device could also be used, such as pepper spray. It all
depends on the situation.
