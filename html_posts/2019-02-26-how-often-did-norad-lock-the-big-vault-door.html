**How often did NORAD lock the big vault door?**

Not very often. The door only gets locked during an actual threat event
against the United States. We simulate locking the door during every
exercise, but under most normal circumstances, the doors remain open.

We also will lock the doors during routine blast door maintenance.
There's a large piece of Plexiglas on the back side of both of the
doors, so you can see the locking mechanism at work, and you can see the
bolts slide into place. It's a surreal feeling being inside the mountain
when the doors actually do lock.
