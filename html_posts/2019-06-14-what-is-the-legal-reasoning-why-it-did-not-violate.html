**What is the legal reasoning why it did not violate Federal law for the
Steele dossier to be given the Clinton campaign? I am not looking for
analysis of political or moral aspects here, just the legalities of the
situation.**

Because there is no Federal law which makes opposition research illegal.

The only laws surrounding opposition research relate to campaign finance
funding, where the money comes from, and on what it can be spent.

Beyond that, researching your opponent is not illegal. Using outside
agencies to research your opponent is also not illegal.
