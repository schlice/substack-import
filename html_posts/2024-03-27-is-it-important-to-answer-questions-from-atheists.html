The answer to this question is related to the reason why we engage in
the practice called *apologetics* in the first place*.*

The word *apologetics*, derived from the Greek word *apologia*, means
"speaking in defense." Apologetics is therefore the discipline of
defending a position through systematic argumentative discourse.
**Christian apologetics is the rational defense of the Christian
worldview as** ***objectively true, rationally compelling*** **and**
***existentially or subjectively engaging*.**

But *why* do we do it? Do we participate in apologetics because we want
to win arguments against atheists? Do we want to *prove those darn
atheists wrong?* No, exactly the opposite. We actually participate in
apologetics because it helps us *prove ourselves right.*

Apologetics helps us to prove to ourselves why we believe what we do.
Being able to articulate our beliefs in a rational and logical way helps
us to understand what we believe, and why, which can only strengthen our
faith.

The justification comes straight from Jesus:

> One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing
> that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, "Of all the
> commandments, which is the most important?"
>
> "The most important one," answered Jesus, "is this: 'Hear, O Israel:
> The Lord our God, the Lord is one. Love the Lord your God with all
> your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all
> your strength.' The second is this: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'
> There is no commandment greater than these." --- Mark 12:28--31 NIV

How exactly do you love God with all your mind? You engage your mind in
the practice of understanding what we believe and why. This is one way
in which we can love God with all our mind.

The fact that all Scripture is God-breathed underscores that God expects
us to be ready to defend our faith and articulate why we believe what we
do:

> All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking,
> correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God
> may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. --- 2 Tim 3:16--17 NIV

The study of apologetics helps a believer be "thoroughly equipped" to
uphold and defend the faith.

So it doesn't really matter that you can't change the mind of the
atheist. In fact, it's not your place to do so. It is only God who can
give them a heart receptive to the message of Christianity. Remember the
following:

> As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins, in which
> you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the
> ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in
> those who are disobedient. --- Ephesians 2:1--2 NIV

The atheist is *dead* in his or her transgressions and sins. Can a dead
person save themselves? Can they decide to believe in Christ on their
own? No, only God can make them alive again, and *then* they can accept
Christ. So you, answering a Quora question from an atheist, will not
accomplish that. Unless God has already softened their heart, they will
not be receptive to your answer.

But that's okay, because your answer really isn't for them. Your answer
is more for the third-party reader who is investigating the same
question that they heard some other atheist ask once, and then they
stumble upon your answer. You deftly defended the faith, as is your
calling. The atheist who posed the question (and his ilk) will
derisively dismiss you, and even mock you for your belief. And that's
okay, because I drink atheist tears alongside my morning cereal. Part of
a good breakfast.

*haha lol jk*

But the person who was **genuinely** seeking an answer to your question
will find it. And maybe, just maybe, that answer will touch their heart
and will spark further investigation.

That is our great hope.
