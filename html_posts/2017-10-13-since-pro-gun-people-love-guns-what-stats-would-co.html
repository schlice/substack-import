**Content:** []{.rendered_qtext}

Really, the only statistics that would make a difference are ones that
show how restricting access to guns to **law-abiding** citizens makes
**non-law-abiding** citizens less able to do their jobs, and thus makes
everyone safer.

Since these statistics will never be honestly produced, the effective
answer is that there are no statistics that will ever change the minds
of the pro gun camp.
