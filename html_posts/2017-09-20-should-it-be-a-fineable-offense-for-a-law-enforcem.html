Police officers retain their police powers whether they are on duty or
off duty. The clothing they wear is not relevant.

Many jurisdictions allow firearms to be openly carried by anyone.
Forcing police to not openly carry does not meet the current legal
standard, plus there is no reason for such a standard.

Perhaps you could articulate a reason that such a law would be needed,
and perhaps then we can come up with a better solution.
