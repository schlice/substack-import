**Do you think foreign representatives\' spending money at the Trump
International Hotel is a violation of the U.S. Constitution\'s
emoluments clause?**

The Emoluments Clause, from Article I, Section 10 of the Constitution:

> No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no
> Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall,
> without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument,
> Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or
> foreign State.

The idea was that the Clause was to be a very broad catch-all to prevent
the government from being influenced by foreign powers.

Trump has often been criticized because he did not place his assets,
like Trump Tower and Mar-a-Lago, into a "blind trust," but instead
placed them into a "revocable trust."

The problem with Trump is that his assets are tied to his name. Even in
a blind trust, he can't "unknow" the fact that his blind trust contains
Trump Tower. His properties have value because of the Trump name.
Granted, they still have value on their own, but a significant portion
of the value rests on the Trump name.

This presents a problem. Regardless of the type of trust, Trump can't
"unknow" the fact that Trump Tower is in a trust, and he could
potentially make public policy decisions based on the fact that someone
spent money at Trump Tower.

But you asked very specifically if foreign representatives, spending
money at Trump Hotel, is a violation of the clause. The specific answer
is **no**, this alone does not constitute a violation. Now, if Trump
changed foreign policy *specifically because* a foreign representative
spent money at Trump Hotel, **that** would be a clear violation of the
Clause. But simply because a foreign representative spends money at a
business with your name on it does not, by itself, constitute a
violation of Emoluments.

One potential source of a conflict: one of Trump's properties has
outstanding loans from the Bank of China, which is majority owned by the
State. If the Bank of China were to ever change the conditions on any of
Trump's outstanding loans, the White House ethics lawyers and others
would scrutinize the deal closely, to make sure that the change wasn't a
"gift." Trump has been notoriously hard on China, especially regarding
their theft of intellectual property. Even this action might look like
he was trying to exert pressure on China in an effort to get a better
deal on his loans. This isn't a problem that you solve simply by turning
over control of your businesses to someone else.
