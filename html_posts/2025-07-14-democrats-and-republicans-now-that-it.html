The thing is, God can use anyone to do anything He wants to do. So sure,
God could have intervened to keep Trump alive so that Trump could do
something which furthered His plan.

But God's plan may not be saving our country. It may not have even been
in Trump's best interest. God's plan is God's plan, and He's not
normally in the business of telling people His plans:

> *It is the glory of God to conceal a matter. --- Proverbs 25:2*
>
> *Truly You are a God who hides Himself. --- Isaiah 45:15*
>
> *No one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. --- 1
> Corinthians 2:11*
>
> *The secret things belong to the Lord our God --- Deuteronomy 29:29
> NKJV*
>
> *As you do not know the path of the wind, or how the body is formed in
> a mother's womb, so you cannot understand the work of God, the Maker
> of all things. --- Ecclesiastes 11:5*
>
> *"For My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My
> ways," declares the Lord. "As the heavens are higher than the earth,
> so are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts higher than your
> thoughts." --- Isaiah 55:8--9*

So Trump being saved is certainly part of God's plan, but the Bible
seems to tell us that it's unlikely that we're even going to know what
God's plan is.

But that doesn't make Trump a good person. God uses flawed people all
the time. Just look at the characters in the Bible. They certainly
weren't what you would consider "good people." David was an adulterer
and a murderer. Paul used to be Saul, a ruthless slaughterer of nascent
Christians. Solomon had a *harem* for crying out loud. But God used all
of those flawed people to advance His plan.

So it's clear that Trump was saved to do something which will further
God's plan. *What* that something is remains a mystery, and will likely
remain a mystery until we get to ask Him about it face to face.
