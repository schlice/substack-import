Like any other workday, on Friday, January 20, 2017, I'll be working. My
customers rely on me.

But I'll also have the TV on in the background so that I can watch the
festivities.

It's an important event. The peaceful transition of power between
elected governments is a hallmark of United States constitutional
democracy. It's a momentous occasion, and I'll be sure to watch it.

I also want to hear the Inaugural Address. To be fair, I'd much rather
read the transcript once it's posted at the White House website, but I
want to hear it live.

This is an historic election. Why? This is the first time in the history
of the nation that we have elected someone who has never served in
elected office, or is not a former military officer. Additionally, we
gave him a fully-loaded Republican majority in Congress. This is both a
complete and total repudiation of Obama's economic policies and a
mandate to get it fixed. I am excited to see that plan come together. I
like Trump's policies, and I like his plans, especially what he's laid
out for his first 100 days (see my post
[[here](https://www.quora.com/Do-Trump-voters-understand-how-scared-many-groups-of-Americans-are/answer/Bill-Stein)
]{.qlink_container}for a detailed list). I'm not too sure about him
personally; I've heard mixed things. But I vote for policy, not
personality. And I'm super excited to see who he nominates to fill the
late Justice Antonin Scalia's seat on the Supreme Court. That person has
BIG shoes to fill.
