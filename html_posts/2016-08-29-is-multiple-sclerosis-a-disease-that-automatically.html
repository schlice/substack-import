(Answer specific to the United States)

Short answer: no. There is no disease or condition that automatically
disqualifies anyone from doing anything.

Longer answer: The Americans with Disabilities Act and its amendments
have changed the system of employment in the United States. No longer is
a prospective employer allowed to ask you whether or not you have a
disability before you are hired. No longer can you be judged because you
are disabled.

When an employer wants to hire someone, they can list the physical
requirements of the job. We had to be able to lift 100 pounds, possess a
minimum level of cardiovascular ability, walk, crouch, crawl, climb
stairs, use fingers with dexterity, and work in high-stress situations.
The employer is able to assess your physical ability to ensure it meets
the standards. On your application, they are only allowed to ask you if
you are able to meet the listed requirements, with or without reasonable
accommodations. If you are, you answer yes. No more, no less. There is
no requirement to disclose your disability, as that is considered
protected health information (PHI) which is between you and your doctor.

To become a police officer in our jurisdiction, you must accomplish the
following:

1.  Pass a written examination and Oral Boards
2.  Pass a background investigation and Computer Voice Stress Analysis
    exam
3.  Pass psychological, medical, physical assessment, and drug
    screenings

Once those are complete, you enter the POST-certified Basic Law
Enforcement Academy. At the conclusion of your training, you are sworn
and placed into On the Job Training (OJT) which advances you to
progressively more responsibility over time. Eventually, you work solo
as other officers do.

So long as you can meet the standards, and you can do the job, you can
be hired, disability or not.
