**Content:** [I think you are asking about the \"lost memory\" part of
your question. While [[Matthew
Bohrer](https://www.quora.com/profile/Matthew-Bohrer)]{.qlink_container}
already told you about being charged while in your coma, once you come
out, you can still be charged for the murder, even though you remember
none of it.\
\
Basically, the law considers what your state was at the time you
committed the crime. Your lack of memory may be taken into consideration
at sentencing, but whether or not you remember your crime doesn\'t
alleviate you of the requirement to stand for your
crime.]{.rendered_qtext}
