**Our Christian neighbors always threaten to call the police on me if
I'm outside because \"God doesn't want to see such dirty skin\". This
happens almost daily. Is that harassment?**

Indeed it is.

Let them call the police a few times and see what happens to them when
they get charged with abuse of the 911 system.

More importantly, a few visits by the police because your neighbors
don't like how your skin looks are great evidence to use in a harassment
lawsuit, as evidence for a restraining order, etc.
