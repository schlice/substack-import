**Is there a way to create something like a bank in Gmail where all
mails from one of my subscriptions will be placed instead of them being
mixed with others like it usually is the case?**

Gmail doesn't really have a concept of "folders," but it does have a
concept of "Labels."

All of your messages come in to one bucket, and labels are applied to
them. You can see the one big bucket of mails when you select "All mail"
on the left hand side, or type **in:all** in the search bar. You will
see all of your emails, and the labels applied to them. When you look at
your "Inbox," you're actually looking at all of the mail labeled
"Inbox."

So what you are asking to do is to label a specific sender's emails, and
then "skip the Inbox" (which means it won't apply the label "Inbox" to
that message). You can optionally also mark the message as read. Here's
how you do it:

1\. Select one of the target messages using the check mark selector on
the left side of the message.

2\. Pick the "More" menu just above the email list (it's the
three-vertical-dot selection on the right-hand side)

master_h="33"}

3\. Select "Filter messages like this"

4\. Ensure the sender's email address is the correct one you want to
filter, and then click the **Create filter** button (not the blue Search
button)

5\. On the next screen, it will say "When a message is an exact match
for your search criteria:", then choose **Skip the inbox (Archive it)**
and **Apply the label: \<choose label\>** and choose an appropriate
label for your subscription. You can also choose to apply your label to
any messages already in your Inbox using the selection at the bottom,
which reads **Also apply filter to \<X\> matching conversations**.

From that point on, all messages coming in meeting those criteria will
be labeled with your label and won't appear in your Inbox. You can click
on your label on the left side to see them, or choose **All mail** to
see them as well.
