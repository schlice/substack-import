**What is an HOA?**

An HOA is a "Homeowner's Association." It is a not-for-profit
corporation (IRS section 501(c)(4)) which manages a common interest
company. The mission statement of the company generally includes keeping
home values high by controlling the exterior appearance of the homes
under its purview.

There are two types of HOAs: **mandatory** and **voluntary.**

Mandatory HOAs are created before the houses are first sold, and are
included as part of the deed to the property. When you purchase the
property, you agree to abide by the rules of the HOA that is already in
place. You cannot "opt out" of a mandatory HOA. They **control** the
exterior of your home, and can tell you whether or not you can or can't
make certain changes to your home. They can also fine you, place a lien
on your home if you don't pay, and foreclose on that lien to get their
money.

Voluntary HOAs run much the same way as mandatory HOAs. They are also
not-for-profit corporations which help to pay for some neighborhood
amenities, but they are, as the name implies, voluntary. They don't
**control** the outside of your house; they rely on whatever local
government zoning is in place (and they help you stay in compliance with
them, even though they don't provide the local control). They may also
offer voluntary benefits, like club memberships.

**Can your neighbors create one without the board of directors?**

Since an HOA is a 501(c)(4) not-for-profit **corporation,** it has to
conform with all of the requirements of having a corporation, such as
appointing a Board of Directors.

But even if your neighbors *create* one, it would only be voluntary.
Mandatory HOAs can only be implemented before any of the houses are
sold.

You can convert a voluntary HOA to a mandatory HOA, but you must have
permission of 100% of the homeowners. Even one dissenting homeowner
would mean that you can't create a mandatory HOA in that community.
