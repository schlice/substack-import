Um, sounds like you've misinterpreted Matthew 7:1 also. And what the
vast majority of people miss is the context. **For text, without
context, is just pretext**.

Many individuals understand Jesus\' meaning as \"You don\'t have the
right to tell me I\'m wrong,\" and use this scripture to try to silence
their critics. When read in isolation, Jesus\' admonition to \"Judge
not\" does appear to exclude all critical judgments. But the paragraph
is much more than just those words.

When the Bible says that we should not judge, this doesn't mean we can't
show discernment. Just a little later, Jesus says, "Do not give dogs
what is sacred; do not throw your pearls to pigs. If you do, they may
trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces" (Matthew
7:6 NIV). Later, He continues: "Watch out for false prophets. . . . By
their fruit you will recognize them" (verses 15--16).

If we cannot judge, then how are we to know who are "dogs," "pigs," or
"false prophets?" Jesus is indeed giving us the ability to tell right
from wrong.

Actually, in another Bible passage, Jesus gives *the direct command to
judge:* "Stop judging by mere appearances, but instead judge correctly"
(John 7:24 NIV). So now we're starting to see what Jesus was actually
saying about judging wrongly:

- Superficial judgement is wrong. It is sinful to pass judgement on
  someone based solely on their appearance.
- Hypocritical judgement is wrong. Jesus warns against hypocrisy in
  Matthew 7:3-5 and commands us not to judge others in Matthew 7:1. He
  compares us to hypocrites in Matthew 6:2, 5, and 16. When we blame
  others for their wrongdoing while committing the same sin ourselves,
  we are really just condemning ourselves (Romans 2:1).
- Unforgiving judgement is wrong. According to Titus 3:2, we must
  \"always be gentle toward everyone.\" As Jesus cautioned, \"In the
  same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure
  you use, it will be measured to you\" (Matthew 7:2), it is the
  merciful who will receive mercy (Matthew 5:7).
- Untrue judgement is wrong. Bearing false witness is sinful (Proverbs
  19:5). "Slander no one" (Titus 3:2)

TL;DR: We are commanded against judging **unfairly** or
**unrighteously**, but Jesus commands "correct judgement." We are to be
discerning (Colossians 1:9; 1 Thessalonians 5:21). We are to preach the
whole Gospel, including teaching about sin (Acts 20:27; 2 Timothy 4:2).
We are to gently confront our brothers or sisters in Christ who have
lost their way or have erred (Galatians 6:1). We are to speak the truth
in love (Ephesians 4:15).
