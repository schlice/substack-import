**According to Warren v. District of Columbia, how can I protect myself
when the police won\'t if guns are banned?**

According to another decision, *District of Columbia v. Heller*, 554
U.S. 570 (2008), the gun ban was unconstitutional, so you can protect
yourself with a firearm in your home in the District of Columbia. You
should check city laws to see how exactly this shook out in practice. To
be honest, I'm unsure how it ended up, but we do know that the gun ban
for guns in the home was unconstitutional.

*Warren* held that the police are not under any legal obligation to
protect **you** personally. Police have a general responsibility to
protect *the public at large*, they just don't have a specific
responsibility to protect you.

That means that ultimately, you are responsible for your own personal
safety. Within the confines of the law, you should ensure that you are
sufficiently protected, and that you have taken steps to protect
yourself and your family. What you choose to do and what you are legally
permitted to do will vary wildly. Please talk to a lawyer in your area
to find out what is legal and what is not.
