**What smut material or dirty magazines can I buy for my teen son, so he
doesn't look online for it? We've talked about it and I said I would get
him something more "respectable" to keep under his bed, less porn...
more his own imagination.**

First off, I applaud your ingenuity. Trying to channel his normal urges
is a great idea.

But I've got a little secret for you: *you can't stop it.*

That material is going to make it to his eyeballs one way or another.
Maybe it will be a nude scene in a movie. Maybe it will be at a friend's
house (maybe you can filter your own Internet, but you can't filter
everyone's Internet). And regardless of what you do, he's going to want
to find *more* of what he just saw, because it's *way better* than
anything you give him.

So at that point, he will be searching for his own material, and he will
either keep the material you give him under his bed to appease you, or
(worse) he will secretly resent you trying to "control" him. Doing what
you are trying will only teach him that if he likes what he sees, he's
going to have to sneak past you to get to it. And if you are unaware,
there are more technological ways to do so than you can even imagine.

Sounds like this is a no-win situation, right?

Well, not so fast.

What I've found that works well is *more involvement, not less*. Talking
about porn is just one facet in the whole approach to sex. Watching
movies with your teen that may contain sensitive subjects are perfect
"teachable moments." Your son wants to know what you think about those
things, and discussing them live is a good way to use the material to
teach about relationships and sex, and to understand them in context.

With boys, developing self-control is key. In a society where sex is as
easily viewed as sunlight, teaching your son appropriate restraint along
with modeling appropriate relationships with women will go a long way to
help him to understand what he sees and to resist the temptation.

In other words, the material is always going to be there. Our job as
parents is to help our kids *frame it properly* so that it doesn't
become an outsized factor in his life. It's there, but it just isn't
that big of a deal for him. Living with the fact that it is so pervasive
in our culture means that we have to teach our boys to handle it.
