**If a President and his staff are issued subpoenas for documents but
they refuse to comply, what keeps them from just destroying the
documents all-together?**

Ask Hillary.

When her personal email server in her home was discovered, the server on
which she was sending and receiving classified information (a huge
violation of Federal law), she had the server destroyed, and BleachBit
was run on all of the drives (an application which wipes the drives by
overwriting random data over them), effectively destroying the data.

What has happened to Hillary? Nothing.

So what keeps the President and his staff from destroying documents?
Apparently nothing.
