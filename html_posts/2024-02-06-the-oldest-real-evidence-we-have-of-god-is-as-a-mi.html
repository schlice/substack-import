The Hebrew Bible, also known as the Old Testament, is a collection of
sacred books that developed over about a thousand years. The oldest
texts are thought to date back to the 10th or 11th centuries BC. The
Torah, the first five books of the Bible, were likely finalized and
canonized during the Babylonian Exile in the 6th--5th century BC. The
entire Hebrew Bible was complete by about 100 AD.

The earliest examples of written Paleo-Hebrew date back to the 10th
century BC. The Khirbet Qeiyafa ostracon, which was found in a dig at
the ancient fortress city near Beit Shemesh, is the earliest Hebrew
writing previously found, dating back to 1000 BC.

But you talk about "the oldest evidence we have of god" when these
writings are not "evidence" of God. They are the oldest writings we have
about God, but they are not "evidence" of God.
