Proving medical malpractice is difficult. You basically need to prove

- The physician and/or other health care providers *neglected* to follow
  standard, accepted medical procedures.
- Because of this negligence, the physician and/or other health care
  providers *misdiagnosed* you.
- Because of the misdiagnosis, you suffered preventable physical,
  emotional and/or financial harm.

If you believe that the doctor did not follow standard, accepted medical
practices which led to the misdiagnosis, you should definitely engage
the services of a medical malpractice attorney where you live. They can
help you file a lawsuit and receive compensation for some or all of
these potential damages your mom may have suffered because of the
misdiagnosis:

- Mental anguish
- Physical pain and suffering
- Diminished capacity to enjoy life
- Loss of companionship and guidance for family members
- Current and future medical expenses
- Lost income
- Diminished earning capacity
- Other damages recoverable under your state's laws

Seek a consultation with a medical malpractice attorney in your area
sooner rather than later, or the time period within which you can bring
an action may expire.
