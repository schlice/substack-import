**Content:** [I have seen this when I run and listen to music. I find
that because of my former military background that I \"march to the
music,\" and this seems to translate to my running. I\'ll tend to run in
cadence with the music, and if I\'m not careful, I end up over-exerting
myself. The music stops, and my first thought is, \"why in the world am
I running so hard? This wasn\'t supposed to be a hard run!\" The music
tends to mask the symptoms that I\'m usually so in tune with.\
\
Failing to listen to your body is the number one way you can over-exert
yourself. I\'m reasonably certain that \"being reminded of the burn\"
doesn\'t cause the body to respond differently. I am certain that you
will fail to listen to your body and you can far more easily over-exert
yourself when you are listening to music. Happens to me all the time.\
\
I just have to keep the music a little lower in my ears, so that I can
\"hear\" my body. I also use workout programs that interrupt the music
and let me know my pace, speed, distance covered, and heart rate. If
those are noticeably different from what they should be (or what I
expect them to be), I pause the music and run in silence to see how my
body is responding.\
\
For reference, I use Endomondo on my Android phone to keep track of my
run and me.]{.rendered_qtext}
