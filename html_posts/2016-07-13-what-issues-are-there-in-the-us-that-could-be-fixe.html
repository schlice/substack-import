I would pose several fixes:

1.  Term Limits. When the government was originally formed, there was no
    notion of a "career politician." Politicians were chosen from
    ordinary life, went to Washington, served their term, and returned
    to their jobs and homes. I don't see a problem imposing term limits
    on politicians. There are enough "career" positions in Washington
    that can fill in the knowledge gaps when it comes to turnover of
    Congressmen.
2.  Unelected Bureaucrats. Currently, we have all of these Federal
    agencies which consist of unelected bureaucrats. Congress gave these
    organizations the authority to make Federal policy, which applies to
    all citizens of the US, and has the force of law behind them. This
    is patently unconstitutional. It says very plainly that only
    Congress can write law. We get mad when the Supreme Court legislates
    from the bench, but we don't get mad that there are all of these
    federal agencies which do the same thing? Make a Congressman
    responsible for passing all of the laws which come out of Federal
    agencies. We need elected personnel to hold accountable for the
    actions of federal agencies.
3.  Unfunded Mandates. No bill can be passed which imposes a financial
    cost on the states without funding that mandate as well.
4.  Budget. Require Congress to pass a budget or they lose their jobs
    and they all go home. Simple. Require them to stick by that budget.
5.  The Supreme Court must first and foremost interpret the
    Constitution. They can secondarily rely on existing case law, but
    when case law is in question or being reviewed, the Constitution is
    the ultimate authority.
