Yes.

As God exists outside of time, His view of our lives has a completely
different perspective than ours.

At the very time of the creation of the universe, God knew, for all of
time, that you would be born. He knew, for all of time, what decisions
you would freely make along the way. And He knew, for all of time, how
those decisions would shape your life. Because He exists *outside* of
time, He does not experience time as we do. For God, it's all *now*. The
past is *now*. The present is *now*. The future is *now*.

So indeed, He can see it all, as He exists outside of time as we know
it.
