I'm so sorry this happened.

I'm going to second
[[Cliff](https://www.quora.com/profile/Cliff-G-13)]{.qlink_container}'s
comments here. Go to the police immediately, and hire an attorney.

This 18 year old is committing both Federal and state crimes, and is
extorting/committing blackmail. Not only should he or she be in jail,
but your daughter should receive damages if for nothing else than the
psychological trauma.

Original question:

Can a case be made in civil court, that my 16 yr old daughter is
entitled to damages, as she was driven to paranoia, panic, & catatonia
by an 18 yr old, who has her nudes? He has threatened her to post them
worldwide, with the push of a button?
