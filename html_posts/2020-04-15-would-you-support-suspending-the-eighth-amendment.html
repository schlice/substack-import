**Would you support suspending the Eighth Amendment for particular kinds
of criminals?**

No.

There really is no further discussion needed other than "no," but let me
explain.

The 8th Amendment states:

> Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor
> cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.

I'm certain when you're talking about "particular kinds of criminals,"
you mean the "cruel and unusual punishments" part. Like maybe we should
go back to firing squads, or drawing and quartering (but with Mack
trucks instead of horses). Or public executions. Or maybe implementing

right there, and we can charge Pay-Per-View!

Just like I am against restricting hate speech, I am also against
limitations on any Constitutional amendment for "certain classes" of
anyone or anything.

**Because it's usually exactly those kinds of things that the Amendment
was designed to protect**.

The Amendment was designed to protect the classification of people as
"particular kinds of criminals." Because, just like hate crimes:

- *Who gets to decide who is a "particular kind of criminal"?*
- *What happens when someone is classified as a "particular kind of
  criminal" and you don't think he should be? Or vice-versa?*

We cannot fall into the trap of dividing our country. Our last president
was expert at dividing us against each other in this way. Don't allow
yourself to fall into the same trap.
