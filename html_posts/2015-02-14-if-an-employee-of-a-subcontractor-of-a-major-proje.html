**Content:** [I\'m unsure of the contractual relationship here. Are you
the GC? Who is getting paid? Would not the sub get paid for his work?\
\
Presumably, there is a contractual relationship here: payment for work.
If the work has been done and the payment has not been made, you will
have to take the individual to court to hold him to the terms of the
contract. If it\'s longer-term work and payment stops, then work stops
too.\

Maybe you could clarify a little?]{.rendered_qtext}
