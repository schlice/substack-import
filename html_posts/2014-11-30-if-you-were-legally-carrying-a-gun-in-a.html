**Content:** [If you are knowingly violating policy and concealing a
handgun in a place where you are forbidden by policy to do so, you
probably have the conviction of morals to violate the policy you know to
be wrong to safeguard your own life, or someone else\'s life.\
\
That being the case, you are already willing to face the consequences of
violating policy.\
\
So of course you would act, and then use the subsequent dust-up to point
out the absurdity of the policy (i.e. if I was following policy, person
X would be dead, and I would probably be dead too).\
\
Could you be fired? Certainly. Absurd or not, the business has the right
to set policy. If there is a sufficient dust-up though, I suspect that
the business would not fire you, because it would look bad for
them.]{.rendered_qtext}
