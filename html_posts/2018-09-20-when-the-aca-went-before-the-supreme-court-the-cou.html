**When the ACA went before the Supreme Court, the court ruled that
Congress can govern individual health actions because of their economic
consequences. What stops Congress from regulating any choice because of
the economic consequences?**

In actuality, the Court did not find what you state. Quite the opposite,
actually. In *National Federation of Independent Businesses v. Sebelius
(2012)*, the court found that the individual mandate, which required all
persons to buy health insurance or pay a penalty, was outside of
Congress\' powers under the Commerce Clause. Therefore, the economic
consequences of *not buying health insurance* was not something that
Congress was authorized to control using the Commerce Clause as
justification.

SCOTUS ***did*** find, however, that the individual mandate *was*
Constitutional under Congress' *taxation powers*. SCOTUS used the
oft-cited "if it walks like a duck" logic to support their findings:

- The penalty was collected by the IRS
- The penalty was calculated on an IRS Form 1040
- The penalty was paid along with taxes, on Tax Day
- Congress can, and does, frequently use taxes to control public
  behavior

See where this is going?

While the government could call the individual mandate a "penalty" if
they chose, the Court determined that it was actually a tax, and
therefore was Constitutional under Congress' taxation authority. In
other words, it's collected by the IRS, it is collected on Tax Day, it's
reported on your 1040, so you can call it a penalty if you want, but
it's really a tax.

So to answer the second part of your question:

**What stops Congress from regulating any choice because of the economic
consequences?**

Nothing. They just do it with taxes under their taxation power, not with
"penalties" under the Commerce Clause.

Take, for example, cigarettes. Congress has imposed *massive* taxes on
tobacco and tobacco products in order to discourage their use. States do
this too: most states have a higher tax on drinks which contain refined
sugar than on other drinks. Governments do this to attempt to regulate
behavior when it is in the public interest to do so. But it happens all
the time, just not in the way you're suggesting.
