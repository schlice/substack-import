**Content:** [It really is a very personal decision, and it can really
only be answered by the individual traveler.\

To me, the answer to that question depends on the length of the journey.
And it\'s a very personal decision. Personally, I\'m okay with the
amenities (food, seats, etc) in a 747 flying overseas sitting in
business class. Some people can\'t sleep in the business class seats
(which just recline a lot, they don\'t recline horizontally) and need a
fold-flat seat like you get in first class. You do get better food in
first class than you do in business class, but whether or not it is
worth it is really up to the person sitting in that seat. To me, the
food in business class is good. It\'s the difference between a high end
sedan and a luxury sedan.\
\
In business class, I have the same amenities (access to the same movie
system) that I have in first class, I have power outlets (both 110V and
USB power), I have WiFi, so to me a business class seat is perfect. But
again, it really is up to the person in the seat.\
\
If it\'s a special occasion and you\'re really pulling out all the
stops, I\'d go first class. But if not, I\'d save the
money.]{.rendered_qtext}
