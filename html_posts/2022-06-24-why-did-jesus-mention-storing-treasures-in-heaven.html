First, let's start with the actual passage, try to understand what
Christ was saying, and then see if we can apply that understanding to
the question.

> "Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and
> vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for
> yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy,
> and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure
> is, there your heart will be also." --- Matthew 6:19--21 NIV

\

The Bible mentions "rewards" in heaven a number of times.

> Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which
> the Lord, the righteous judge, will award to me on that day, and not
> only to me but also to all who have loved his appearing. --- 2 Timothy
> 4:8 ESV

Here, Paul's second letter to Timothy mentions "the crown of
righteousness" which is a treasure awaiting us in heaven.

> The one who receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a
> prophet's reward, and the one who receives a righteous person because
> he is a righteous person will receive a righteous person's reward. ---
> Matthew 10:41 ESV

Matthew talks about rewards which will be received in heaven.

> "Behold, I am coming soon, bringing my recompense with me, to repay
> each one for what he has done." --- Revelation 22:12 ESV

Revelation talks about Jesus bringing "recompense" (rewards) with him
which will be used to repay us based on what we have done.

\

So there are various locations in the Bible where rewards in heaven are
mentioned. But Jesus did something very important in this passage from
the Sermon on the Mount that is missed by the question. **He linked the
"storing of treasure" to "our hearts."** "For where your treasure is,
there your heart will be also." This is monumentally significant in
order to understand what Jesus was saying.

We are supposed to honor God with everything we do. We are supposed to
treasure Christ first and foremost. If we treasure Christ in our life,
we will commit our worldly resources --- our time, our money, our talent
Colossians 3:23--24 ESV

When we devote our lives to God, it does not go unnoticed.

> "If anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones
> who is my disciple, truly I tell you, that person will certainly not
> lose their reward" --- Matthew 10:42 ESV

\

So back to the question. It's clear that Jesus said we ought to be
storing up treasures in heaven, because doing so means we're living for
Christ and honoring him here on earth.

But one line of the question is a little off:

> Why does some Christians make it sound like it\'s a sin to want to be
> rich in heaven?

The answer is likely that some Christians misunderstand what the
"rewards" in heaven will be, especially given that the questioner said
that "it's a sin to want **to be rich** in heaven." It's clear that the
person saying that it's a sin to want to be rich in heaven doesn't
actually know what the "treasures" in heaven will be, and what we will
be "rich" in. It certainly won't be possessions.

So what will the treasures in heaven be? Our friends at

treasures are, and where some of the confusion may be coming from:

> The rewards we gain in heaven are not like the rewards we earn here on
> earth. We tend to think in material terms---mansions, jewels, etc. But
> these things are only representations of the true rewards we will gain
> in heaven. A child who wins a spelling bee treasures the trophy he

So we're not storing up "physical treasures" which will make us "rich"
in heaven. We're storing up satisfaction, fulfillment, and completion of
our story. Our good works on earth store up a celebration. That is the
reward we will have. And it is good to seek it, and it will be eternally
joyous to receive it.
