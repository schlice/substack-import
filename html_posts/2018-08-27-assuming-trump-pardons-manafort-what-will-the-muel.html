**Assuming Trump pardons Manafort, what will the Mueller team do about
that? Can state charges be brought for the same crimes?**

While in general, a state *could* charge an individual with tax evasion
or tax fraud *separately* from the Federal government, in this specific
case, it's likely that they cannot.

In New York, the statute of limitations for tax fraud or tax evasion is
either five or six years, depending on the specific charge they would
like to levy. Manafort's evasion is purported to have taken place in tax
year 2005.

Therefore it's unlikely that New York would be able to file charges of
tax evasion for an incident which took place in 2005.

In Virginia (where Manafort also owned a residence), they have three
years to file for tax fraud (or as their laws state, underpayment of
tax).

So if Trump pardons Manafort for the Federal crimes, it's unlikely that
the state would be able to file charges against him for their own
crimes.
