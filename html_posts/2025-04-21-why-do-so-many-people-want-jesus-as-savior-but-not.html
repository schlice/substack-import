I saw a survey by Barna, their 2025 "[[State of the
Church](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d281c2&url=https://www.barna.com/research/belief-in-jesus-rises/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="barna.com"}]{.qlink_container}" survey, earlier this month.
The survey revealed that more and more young people are choosing to
believe in Jesus. This is very good news. According to Barna's survey
data, the percentage of U.S. adults who say "I have made a personal
commitment to follow Jesus that is still important to my life today" hit
a 21st-century low in 2021 at 54%. Since then, the percentage has jumped
a full 12 points to 66%. It means that more millennial and Gen Z adults
are curious about or are committing to a relationship with Jesus. In a
world which was previously categorized by those same people *walking
away* from their faith, this is something to celebrate.

Yet, according to Barna's survey, many people who are interested in
following (or already do say they follow) Jesus are less interested in
engaging with the church. The survey found that a significant percentage
(27%) of individuals who say they've made a commitment to Jesus *don't
identify as Christians*. This means that while people are indeed finding
Jesus and the truth of the Gospel (which is great), they're not wanting
to be associated with the church (which is problematic).

This matches what you've identified: people want Jesus as *savior*, but
they don't want to pattern their lives after His; they don't want Him to
be *Lord*. This may be because they've been turned off by differences in
denominations as well as controversies in the church and how those play
on social media.

But these nascent Christians will still need other mature Christians who
love Jesus to come alongside them and teach them what following Jesus
looks like in a modern age. In short, they will need Christians to
disciple them. They'll need the church.

So millennials and Gen Z'ers are trying to split the baby. They're
trying to have their cake and eat it too. Pick your metaphor, but
they're trying to parse the difference between being a believer in
Christ yet ignoring the parts of Christianity they consider to be
tasteless: being a member of a church and living life as a committed
Christian.
