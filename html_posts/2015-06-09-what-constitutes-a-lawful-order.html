**Content:** [Peace officers are empowered by their commission to
enforce the law. They are given broad authority to keep the peace. In
the course of performing their duties, they may require you to do
certain things. These things may not be directly codified in law, but
may be required in order to keep the peace. In all these circumstances,
an officer acting with prudence and sound judgment can order you to do
something and you are required by law to do it. The officer is not
required to stop and explain his reasoning before you are required to
comply.\
\
There are many examples that illustrate this. Let\'s say you are
photographer for a newspaper. You are waiting outside a hotel for a
celebrity to appear. Perfectly legal. An officer does not have authority
to tell you to vacate that area, so dojng so would not be a lawful
order. Or would it? What if there was a gas leak and a fire/explosion
hazard existed? In that case, he can tell you to leave the area and if
you refuse, you can be arrested. What if there was a large crowd of
reporters blocking passage on the sidewalk? Because of the quantity of
people congregating they can tell you to move, especially if you are
blocking a public thoroughfare or an exit. You are there lawfully but
the police can still order you to move and you still must comply. The
law does not give you the right to interfere with the officer while in
the commission of his duties nor does it allow you to argue with him.
Feel free to argue with the judge after you are arrested.\
\
And it\'s possible that you didn\'t break any laws, and neither did the
officer, and so the judge just sends everyone home. But again, that\'s
why the judge is the arbiter of the law.\
\
What if you are on the side of the road in a traffic stop and you get
out of your car? Can the officer tell you to get back in your car? It\'s
not illegal for you to be outside of a car. But the officer may feel
that it is too unsafe, for you and for him, for you to be outside of the
car. In such a case, he can order you in the car and you must comply or
face arrest.\
\
Basically, if the officer can justify his order to a judge (not to you),
and it furthers the commission of his duties under the law, it is lawful
for him to give it, and mandatory for you to obey it.]{.rendered_qtext}
