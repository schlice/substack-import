**Is it possible to get a viral infection from someone breathing on my
face or on the food that I eat?**

Yes, and likely no.

Yes, you can absolutely be infected by someone breathing on you. The
virus transmits from person to person by little droplets of water vapor
from an infected person's lungs. Those droplets land on surfaces or on
you. They enter your eyes or nose and infect you through your
respiratory system. This is actually the primary method of coronavirus
transmission.

And likely no, food is not known to be a route of transmission of the
virus. And the information available from outbreaks of SARS and MERS,
caused by coronaviruses similar to the one that causes COVID-19, is
reassuring. According to the WHO, the evidence showed that those
illnesses were not transmitted by food.
