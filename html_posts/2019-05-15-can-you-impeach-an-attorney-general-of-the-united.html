**Can you impeach an attorney general of the United States?**

Absolutely yes. And I'm assuming you're talking about the
"constitutional crisis" that Congress is currently whining about (there
isn't), so I'll frame my answer around that.

In fact, the Constitution designed the ability to impeach appointed
officials as an important check against the power of the executive.
However, to check Congress' power, they vested all law enforcement power
in a single Chief Executive (the President). All three government
agencies, with some level of power against the others.

Understand that Congress can impeach Barr or the President if they
choose. They won't because a court battle in the Senate will expose
their misdeeds in exactly the same way as it will expose their target,
and they can't afford that before 2020. It would be a guaranteed
re-election victory for Trump, and a likely change of House power back
to Republicans, and they won't risk that.
