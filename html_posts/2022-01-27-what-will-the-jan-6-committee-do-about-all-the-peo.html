The Constitution's 5th Amendment says that you cannot be compelled in a
criminal investigation to be a witness against yourself.

Therefore, you do not have to give testimony which would incriminate
you.

That's the regulation surrounding the ability to invoke the 5th
Amendment.

So what do you do about this? **Stop asking people questions which would
force them to incriminate themselves.**

You could also enter into an *agreement* with them which says you will
not prosecute them for their own violations of law if they testify.

Either one of these would work.
