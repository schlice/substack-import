**Content:** [First of all, let me say that I\'m sorry that you have to
think about this in this way in this day and age. Some day, humanity
will look back on this period of time and scratch their heads in
wonderment at discrimination. Secondly, your worries are based on the
fact that you are different races, and not anything else. I don\'t want
to minimize your fear, but I don\'t think it\'s really justified.\
\
Rape is nothing more than sex that is not consensual (minors can\'t
consent, so that\'s why statutory rape is also sex that is not
consensual). Consensual comes from the word \"consensus,\" which means
agreement between all parties. As long as your sex is consensual,
you\'re good.\
\
There are some practical things you can do to avoid even the possibility
of sex that is not consensual:\
]{.rendered_qtext}

- Avoid drunk sex. If you\'re drinking, you have diminished capacity to
  consent. So anything that might diminish her (or your) capacity to
  consent should be avoided.
- Try to get verbal consent before you start. The \"yes means yes\"
  movement on college campuses is seeking to change the burden of proof
  from the accuser to the accused. Under the law, however, you are still
  innocent until proven guilty, and in most states, the guy has to use
  force or threat of force, or the girl has to be completely
  incapacitated in order for it to be rape. That doesn\'t make the
  concept behind \"yes means yes\" bad. Affirmative consent (not just
  the absence of \"no\") is a positive step in protecting yourself. And
  it doesn\'t need to be anything more than \"Is this okay?\" \"Yes.\"
  That\'s it. That\'s positive consent.

Yeah, the video is totally cheesy. But you get the idea.\
\
Could she totally lie and accuse you of rape, accuse you of never
seeking consent, in the exact opposite manner in which it actually
happened? I suppose she could. But unlike college campuses, real world
rape, in a court of law, still has to be proven: Did she try to resist?
Are there defensive wounds? Did anyone else hear it? What did she do
afterwards? Did she call the police? Did she visit the hospital? Did she
talk to a girlfriend? Did anyone see bruising? Is there any physical
evidence at all? Were they dating (not to minimize date rape, but it
plays into whether or not there may have actually been consent)?\
\
Again, it\'s sad that you have to think this way. But the realities of
modern life in the United States always have to be kept in mind.
