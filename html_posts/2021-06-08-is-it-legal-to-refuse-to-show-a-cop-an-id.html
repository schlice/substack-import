The answer, as with all legal answers in the US, is "it depends."

What it depends on is

- what state you're in
- what you are doing

For example, if you are driving a car and you are asked to show your
driver's license, you must do so. Failing to do so will lead to some
pretty serious consequences.

But if you're just walking down the street, minding your own business,
and a police officer walks up to you out of the blue and says, "Hey you!
Show me some ID!" you probably don't need to. You're not engaged in an
activity that requires ID, so you probably don't have to present any.

I said "probably" in that last paragraph because if you were stopped
*because the police suspect you of committing a crime*, you are required
under some states' laws to positively identify yourself, and even though
you're not driving a car or doing anything that requires a license,
"positive identification" may include some form of state-issued ID if
you have one. So before you decide whether or not you're going to
present ID to identify yourself, you'll probably want to find out why
the officer is asking.
