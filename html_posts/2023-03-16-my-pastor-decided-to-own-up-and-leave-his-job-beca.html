Clearly, there is more to the story here that we do not know.

Jesus gives us a blueprint for handling sin within the believers of a
congregation:

> "If your brother or sister sins, go and point out their fault, just
> between the two of you. If they listen to you, you have won them over.
> But if they will not listen, take one or two others along, so that
> 'every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three
> witnesses.' If they still refuse to listen, tell it to the church; and
> if they refuse to listen even to the church, treat them as you would a
> pagan or a tax collector." --- Matthew 18:15--17

This is a very clear blueprint for how the church handles sin from its
members.

It's an interesting passage, because *we are all sinners*. The pastor
and the elders, along with all of the congregants, are all sinners. So
what sins do we confront? According to the Bible, the answer is the
"lifestyle" sins which are committed by those who will not inherit the
kingdom of God. For reference, see [[1 Corinthians
6:9--10](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8df650&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%2520Cor%25206.9%25E2%2580%259310){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container} and [[Galatians
5:19--20](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=06b7b0&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gal%25205.19%25E2%2580%259320){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}; see also [[Titus
3:10--11](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=60e857&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Titus%25203.10%25E2%2580%259311){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}. These types of sins are
*public, ongoing, sinful life* ***choices*** which are different from
the sins we commit in our minds and hearts because we are human and
sinful by nature. So for example, a Christian who is struggling with
impure thoughts would not be disciplined through this church discipline
process. We all struggle with abberant thoughts from time to time, but
not intentionally, and we continually ask God for forgiveness from those
sins. But a Christian who is living in *open, unrepentant* adultery,
sexual immorality, drunkenness, or any of the other sins Paul lists
would have to be confronted in this way.

Pastors are subject to exactly the same discipline. "Those elders who
are sinning you are to reprove before everyone, so that the others may
take warning" ([[1 Timothy
5:20](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3df9a2&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%2520Tim%25205.20){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}). So a pastor who says that
he has to leave his job because of his sin seems like he is making a
choice: the church or the sin. And he's leaving the church because he is
choosing his sin over his church. He could make a full public confession
and he would have been "won over" and the issue would disappear. But if
he is leaving the church, it is because he cannot overcome his sin and
chooses to live in sin than to live as part of the church.

In that case, we are commanded to "treat them as you would a pagan or a
tax collector" which would rightly include excluding them from the body
of Christ. That doesn't mean we shame his children, but they need to
know that their father's willful choices are what is separating them
from their previous community.

The church is nothing more than a group of **like-minded believers**.
It's not a building, or a place. It's a group of people who share common
beliefs. And those beliefs are the only thing that separates a church
from any other social gathering. In sharing those beliefs among that
group, we also share the responsibility to maintain the integrity of
those beliefs. Unfortunately, many churches today never practice church
discipline, even in glaring instances of impropriety and obvious sin.
The result is that the ministry of the church is undermined and the
legitimacy of its message cast in doubt. If the Bible says that
Christians don't do *X*, but there are Christians in our church who are
doing *X*, with no consequences, then outsiders are right to wonder
whether we take the Bible seriously.

Standing up and doing what's right is a matter of principle and personal
integrity. Standing up *as a church body* and doing what's right **even
in the face of public backlash** is a matter of spiritual and Biblical
integrity.
