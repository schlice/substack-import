**Content:** [First of all, the car must be in a public place (garage or
driveway doesn\'t count as public place) and it must be an operational
vehicle (it must look like an operational vehicle to the average
citizen). Finally, one of the following two situations must be present
in order for an officer to search your car without a warrant:\

1.  **Probable Cause**. The officer has to have probable cause that
    there is contraband, or evidence of a crime, in a vehicle. A blunt
    in the ashtray is probable cause to search the vehicle for drugs.
    The strong smell of alcohol or drugs is also enough evidence, in
    most jurisdictions, to search the vehicle. If the officer has
    reasonable suspicion that there are drugs in the car, independent of
    the traffic stop, he can have a K-9 drug dog come and sniff. If he
    does not have a reasonable suspicion that there are drugs in the
    car, he cannot call a K-9 during a traffic stop, and cannot
    unnecessarily delay the traffic stop to have a K-9 do a drug sniff
    (Rodriguez v. U.S., 13-9972).
2.  **Exigent Circumstances.** Assuming the vehicle has a trunk, if the
    officer heard what amounted to sounds of a person from the trunk, he
    could use the exigent circumstances clause to search the vehicle for
    a person in distress.

was right on the money about reduced expectation of privacy in a
vehicle: driving a vehicle on a public road is a privilege (a highly
regulated one at that) afforded by the state. You do not have a right to
drive a car, and you have a very limited right to privacy inside a car.
