The answer, of course, is "it depends."

Some cities have universal "No Turn on Red" laws within the city limits.
If they do, it is usually posted as such.

That said, there are a few conditions under which you cannot turn right
on red:

- Posted No Turn on Red or No Turns
- Red Right Arrow

If it's a solid red light, and you come to a complete stop, you can
normally turn right on red.

The "Right Turn Signal" signage is meant to indicate that the light in
question will not follow the same pattern as the traffic light at the
intersection, and should only be followed for right turns. Traffic at
the intersection should not follow the "Right Turn Signal" indications.
