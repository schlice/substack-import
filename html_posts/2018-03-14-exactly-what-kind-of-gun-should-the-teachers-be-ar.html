**Exactly what kind of gun should the teachers be armed with?**

Teachers should be armed with exactly the kind of gun they feel
comfortable carrying and concealing, and exactly the gun they have
trained with.

Teachers (or anyone, for that matter) should only conceal a handgun that
they feel comfortable firing, drawing from concealment, and placing
shots reliably at a pre-determined distance.

This is almost the wrong question to ask, because it presumes that "we"
are "arming teachers." We are not so much arming teachers as we are "not
preventing teachers from arming themselves." This means that the onus is
on the teacher to meet all the requirements placed on them to get
concealed carry permits; the onus is not on us to provide them with
arms, or even dictate what is appropriate.
