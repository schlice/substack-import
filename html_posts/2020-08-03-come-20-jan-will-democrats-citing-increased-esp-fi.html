**Come 20 Jan, will democrats citing increased (esp. firearm) crime and
chaos in large cities pass legislation to ban "assault rifles" and place
restrictions on magazine capacity? Assumption: both houses and POTUS are
democrat.**

Yes. [[They have already
stated](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=39e5c6&url=https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-biden-orourke-guns/partly-false-claimvideo-shows-joe-bidensayingif-he-wins-hes-coming-forourguns-idUSKBN20S2ST){.external_link

After accepting Beto O'Rourke's endorsement, Biden told Beto that if
elected President, Beto would be the one to "take care of the gun
problem, you're going to be the one who leads this effort."

O'Rourke made his position well known as part of the 2019 Democratic
Presidential Nomination debates, when he famously said, "Hell yes, we're
going to take away your AR-15, your AK-47\[.\]"

Biden already publicly supports a federal gun buyback program to reduce
the number of weapons on the street. He also supports renewing an
expired assault weapons ban imposed in the 1990's and universal
background checks for gun sales.
