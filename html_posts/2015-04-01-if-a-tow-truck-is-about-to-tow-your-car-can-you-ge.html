**Content:** [There are differences between a tow because of an
illegally parked vehicle, and a tow under police direction. ***If the
police direct the car to be towed***, there is zero you can do about it,
hooked, unhooked, nothing. You can\'t request the car be dropped, you
can\'t stop the tow driver from doing his job, you have to take it up
with the police. The tow driver is legally obligated to tow the car when
directed by police, he can\'t be stopped other than by police.\
\
***If the car is being towed because it is illegally parked***,
generally (varies by state), once the tow hook is on the vehicle, it
can\'t be touched; it\'s in the custody of the tow company. You can\'t
get into it at that point (and in most states, doing so is a crime). If
you\'re willing to leave before the car is hooked, the tow driver should
let you leave. If the car is hooked, the tow driver can let you have it
for a \"drop fee.\" In some cases in some states, drop fees are
dependent on time of day. In others, it\'s a flat fee. In Colorado, the
drop fee can be no more than \$70, and drivers must accept credit
cards.\
\
***If you try to drive off while the car is on the tow truck,*** not
only is that not bright (it risks damages to your car and the tow
truck), but it\'s illegal. You have to break the tow cable, and you
would then be liable for leaving the scene of an accident. We had a case
in 2011 in Colorado Springs where a woman got into her car that was
attempting to be towed and drove off. The tow hook was on her car, and
the tow cable became ensnared around the ankle of the tow truck driver.
The cable snapped, and she dragged him for 1.4 miles before he slipped
out of his boot. He was dead at the scene. She claimed she didn\'t see
him. She was convicted on several counts, including manslaughter,
vehicular homicide, leaving the scene of an accident, and some other
lesser charges.\

This case prompted the city to toughen the laws on tows. Tow drivers now
place a big sticker (8.5 x 11) on the driver window explaining that the
vehicle may not be touched because it is legally in the possession of
the tow company, and getting in to the vehicle is a crime. Penalties for
violating the new laws are now much tougher. The new law was named after
the tow truck driver, Allen Lew Rose, and is now known as \"the Rose
Law.\"]{.rendered_qtext}
