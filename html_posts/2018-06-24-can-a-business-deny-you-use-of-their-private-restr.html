**Can a business deny you use of their private restroom if you really
have an emergency?**

In general in the US, yes. Businesses are under no obligation to provide
restrooms which are open to the general public, regardless of the
emergency. Restaurants provide restrooms to customers, but they are not
required to provide access to their private restroom to anyone but
employees. OSHA requires restrooms for employees, but if the
establishment is not a restaurant, there isn't a requirement for
restrooms open to customers. Requirements for restrooms for restaurants
are governed by state law, and those laws can vary by state.

There is a movement as part of the Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis
foundation to provide "can't wait" cards to its members. If you [[sign
up on their
site](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=349a0f&url=https://www.crohnsandcolitis.com/sign-up){.external_link

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"

a "restroom request" card, which helps to explain to businesses that you
have an urgent medical condition which needs immediate attention, and
that the business should open its private restroom to you. But that is
nothing more than a *request*. There is no legal obligation which
requires the business to grant you access, regardless of the emergency
status.
