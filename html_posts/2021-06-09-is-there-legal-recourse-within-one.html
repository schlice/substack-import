Generally, no. Amazon is a privately-owned business, and as such, they
have the right to control who participates in their online community and
who does not. You do not gain or lose anything by being permitted to
review products on their website.

They also are under no obligation to tell you what you may or may not
have done wrong when writing reviews on their site.

If you can articulate some form of loss that you have suffered due to
not being allowed to review products, then perhaps you can hire an
attorney and file a lawsuit claiming damages.

Original question:

Is there legal recourse within one\'s own state if Amazon blocks
reviews? Maybe with the attorney general? They suspended me without
specific explanation and are preventing legitimate reviews from being
heard. This used to be called fraud.
