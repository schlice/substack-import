No, not all religions have a concept of
[[sin](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f5e7ce&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin){.external_link

has no concept of sin.

> **Why do these rules exist if God loves everyone equally?**

If your parents love all their kids equally, why do they have rules for
their behavior? It's to keep them safe and guide them on the right path,
correct?

Isn't that what God is doing?
