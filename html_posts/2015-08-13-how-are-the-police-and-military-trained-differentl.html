**Content:** [(Answer specific to the United States)\
\
They are each trained for their unique mission.\
\
The police are a law enforcement organization, and so they are very
heavily trained in the laws which they are charged with enforcing. It is
a very broad-based training, as a police officer works mostly
autonomously and can respond to any call for service. They are trained
in the use of all of the tools on their toolbelts, including the Taser,
the baton, and of course, their sidearm. They are heavily trained in
arrest control, vehicle operations, and firearms.\
\
The military is a force projection tool for the government, charged with
supporting and defending the Constitution from all enemies. It is very
compartmentalized, so their training is top-down, and specific to their
job function. All recruits are given similar basic military training,
which includes military decorum (how to salute, how to march, etc),
physical conditioning, military history, and military rules and
standards. Once they complete that training, they are assigned to a
\"specialty\" which performs a specific military function. They receive
specialized training in that function. For example, a military member
assigned to Communications and Computer Systems will attend a special
school to learn the basics of that job. Once they complete their \"tech
school\" as it is called, they are assigned to an active unit. They then
learn the specifics of working in that unit, usually through OJT
(on-the-job training) which can be formal or informal.]{.rendered_qtext}
