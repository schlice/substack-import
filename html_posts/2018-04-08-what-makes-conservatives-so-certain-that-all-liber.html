**What makes conservatives so certain that all liberals are for gun
control? As a liberal I know many of my similarly minded brethren have
been armed all along and are currently the fastest growing segment of
the gun buying public.**

Let's tear it down since you have three statements in here.

> ***What makes conservatives so certain that all liberals are for gun
> control?***

The only thing that is certain is that anyone who uses absolutes is
engaging in the logical fallacy of the "argument from omniscience."
Unless you're God, you can't know that **all** liberals are for or
against gun control. You also can't know what **all** conservatives are
thinking either.

More correctly: most conservatives understand that most liberals are
indeed in favor of some form of gun control, and it's the kind of gun
control which involves some form of denying law-abiding citizens access
to guns. But of course, not all liberals are interested in gun control.
And not all conservatives understand that not all liberals are
interested in gun control. But I don't speak in absolutes.

> ***As a liberal I know many of my similarly minded brethren have been
> armed all along***

Good! You and your similarly-minded brethren should work on the kookoos
who actually do want to disarm law-abiding citizens.

> ***\[We\] are currently the fastest growing segment of the gun buying
> public.***

Unless you have some statistics to back this up, I highly doubt this
claim. No one asks your political persuasion when you buy a gun, so gun
stores won't have this information, so unless you got this information
through a nationwide poll (on which people are known to lie), I highly
doubt the veracity of this claim.
