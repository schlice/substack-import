You can *go* to AA, but you're going to have a difficult time *being
helped* by AA if you don't believe in a higher power.

Now, it doesn't have to be God. It doesn't have to be anything religious
(AA isn't a religious program, but it is a spiritual one). It can be the
collective consciousness of everyone in the room. It can be the laws of
nature. It can be the laws of science. It can be love, or humanity, or
the natural flow of the universe. But the program is indeed a spiritual
one, and is based very strongly on the fact that you are powerless to
control your own addiction, and you came to believe that only your
higher power could restore you to sanity, and you let them do it. To
paraphrase the first three steps in the 12-step program:

1.  I can't
2.  My higher power can
3.  I'll let him

So yeah, if you actually want to be helped by AA, you have to believe in
some form of a higher power, ***something greater than yourself*** which
can restore you to sanity. That's the crux of the program: realizing
that there is something out there greater than yourself.
