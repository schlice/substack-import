**My general doctor diagnosed me with MS but I have not been to a
neurologist yet. What kind of testing should I expect? My nearest
neurologist is 40 miles away, will any of the tests require me to bring
a back up driver?**

Your GP can refer you to a neurologist because all the signs point to
MS, but it takes a neurologist to make a final diagnosis of MS. Your GP
can't make that diagnosis. So you haven't been diagnosed with MS yet;
you're suspected of having MS.

Regardless, your GP should have at least ordered you an MRI of your
brain (they should be able to do that without a neurologist). A
radiologist should read your MRI and will (or will not) indicate that
you show the signs of someone with MS.

Your neurologist will then order a series of blood tests to check for
any disease or condition which might cause white spots on an MRI. They
will do a full neurological workup and exam, including clinical history.
He may or may not order additional tests, such as a lumbar puncture
(otherwise known as a spinal tap). You might consider having a driver
when you go to your LP appointment (which won't be the same day as your
first neuro appointment). There are other tests that can be ordered,
such as a visual evoked potential test. All of these exams contribute to
the body of evidence which can be used to diagnose MS.

MS is a complex disease and requires a great deal of research before
coming to a definitive diagnosis. But medicine is progressing at a
breakneck speed. We are making significant progress. Take heart; even if
you do have MS, there are some excellent treatment options.
