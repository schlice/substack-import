**Is writing \"Launch Trump to space and don\'t bring him back\" against
the law?**

No. The First Amendment guarantees that no law will be passed abridging
your ability to speak.

That said, the right to free speech is not unlimited. For example, you
can't lie about someone, in speech or in print. You also can't threaten
to physically harm someone. That's a crime known as a "criminal threat."
Actual articulated threats against the President are routinely
investigated by the Secret Service to determine if they are credible.

In most states, threats or intimidation (depending on state) are also a
crime.
