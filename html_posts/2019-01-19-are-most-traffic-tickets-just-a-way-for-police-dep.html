**Are most traffic tickets just a way for police departments to drum up
revenue for new cruisers?**

No. In most states, ticket revenue goes to the *state*, not directly
into the department issuing the ticket. The police enforce state law, so
the state collects the revenue, not the department.

Funding for vehicles comes from a completely separate funding source
from state government, not from traffic tickets.
