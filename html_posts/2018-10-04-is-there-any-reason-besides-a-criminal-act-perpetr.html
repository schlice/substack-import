**Is there any reason (besides a criminal act perpetrated while sitting
on the bench) that a Supreme Court Justice would be removed? Has anyone
ever been removed for cause from the Supreme Court?**

Let's start with the second question first. Only one US Supreme Court
justice has ever been impeached: Samuel Chase in 1804. Justice Chase was
acquitted by the Senate. Therefore, the answer is no, no Justice has
ever been removed from the Supreme Court through the impeachment
process.

The Constitution says that Supreme Court justices "shall hold their
offices during good behavior." This language, along with the "high
crimes and misdemeanors" language used for impeachment of Presidents, is
intentionally vague. It allows for interpretation by Congress, even
though the "accepted" definition of an impeachable offense is something
that you could be convicted of in court.

However, President (then Representative) Gerald R. Ford said in the
House on 15 Apr 1970, in comments surrounding possible impeachment of
Justice William O. Douglas: "\[A\]n impeachable offense is whatever a
majority of the House of Representatives considers \[it\] to be at a
given moment in history; conviction results from whatever offense or
offenses two-thirds of the other body considers to be sufficiently
serious to require removal of the accused from office."

So to answer the first question: A Supreme Court Justice may be
impeached if the House deems that the Justice has committed an
impeachable offense. That Justice can then be removed from office if 2/3
of the Senate believes that the offense was sufficiently serious as to
require his or her removal from office.
