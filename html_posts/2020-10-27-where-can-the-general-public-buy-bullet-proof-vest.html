**Where can the general public buy bullet proof vests?**

Well, I can certainly tell you to ***not*** buy body armor from
knock-off Chinese marketplaces. *Because they don't work.*

[[https://youtu.be/MsHJWTAlaCY](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=215012&url=https://youtu.be/MsHJWTAlaCY){.external_link

So don't buy that stuff off of Wish or Alibaba or any of those sites.

Go directly to the manufacturer's site to get that stuff. And arguably
the largest and best-known seller of the highest quality body armor is
[[AR500](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=06da88&url=https://www.ar500armor.com){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="ar500armor.com"}]{.qlink_container}. You can buy straight
off their website.

You can also use direct-to-consumer sites like
[[BodyArmorDirect.com](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2135e2&url=https://www.bodyarmordirect.com/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="bodyarmordirect.com"}]{.qlink_container}.
