Thanks for the A2A Layla.

As with everything, I think the answer is \"it depends.\" The whole
reason we have a \"judicial system\" in the first place, and not just a
table of laws and appropriate punishments for violating those laws, is
that the law doesn\'t always adequately cover every conceivable
situation. This is also why there is a \"defense\" to violating the
letter of the law. So we know that the law is already designed to
address such a situation.

In any case, I would always try to find a legal method to protect my
family. But if the safety of my family was in immediate danger, I would
do whatever was necessary to safeguard them. As an example, I\'d run a
red light to get out of the way of someone who wasn\'t stopping behind
me and was going to hit me, and I\'d deal with the consequences later.
