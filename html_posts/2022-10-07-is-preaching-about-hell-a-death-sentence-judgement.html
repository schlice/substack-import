In church circles, sermons about hell are known as "attendance reduction
sermons" as the Sunday following such a sermon traditionally finds the
church with a lower attendance --- people just don't want to hear about
hell.

But it's definitely a Biblical subject, and it's the proverbial elephant
in the room. It needs to be discussed. We need to know what awaits us if
we don't repent.

Preaching about hell is a warning, and it's not much different than the
crazy guy wearing the sandwich board:
