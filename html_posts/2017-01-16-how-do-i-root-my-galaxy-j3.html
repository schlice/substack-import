1.  **Make sure you understand what you are doing**. You are
    circumventing some of the security measures Samsung placed on the
    device to protect the operating system from malicious software or
    processes. Do not proceed unless you have a specific reason to do
    so. If you screw up the rooting process, you might be left with a
    phone which will not boot. That is called "bricking" your phone, as
    it becomes nothing more than a very expensive paper weight. Read
    through the instructions, understand them, and *then* begin the
    process.
2.  **Rooting will void your warranty**. There is a hardware "fuse" in
    the phone which is tripped when the phone is loaded with a
    non-standard kernel. You will see it listed on rooting websites as
    "tripping Knox" since it is the Samsung KNOX software which makes
    use of that fuse. Once that fuse is tripped, your warranty is void.
    You cannot return the handset for replacement under warranty. So if
    your 1-year manufacturer warranty has not yet expired, I would
    strongly suggest not rooting your phone.
3.  There are great tutorials on the Web for how to root your phone. The
    easiest way to root your phone is to use a utility by a developer
    called "Chainfire." He makes the most popular SU (superuser) binary
    for Android phones, SuperSU. He also produces a package called
    "CF-Auto-Root" which automates as much of the rooting process as you
    can. [[Here is one
