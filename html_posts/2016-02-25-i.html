*I don\'t want to have to go through the courts.*

Unfortunately, you do have to go through the courts to change your name.
However, it\'s usually a pretty simple procedure to get it done.

The court is required to check to ensure you are not changing your name
for an illegal reason (i.e. an attempt to evade paying for something
expensive, for example). As long as this is not the case, anyone can
change their name for any other reason.
