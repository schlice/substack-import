The name fits the oath.

Every action that the military takes is in furtherance of that oath to
support and defend the Constitution.

The name "War Department" (which is what the DoD was previously called)
implies that the country's military could be used as an *invasion*
force, and as an *offensive* force. While I don't deny that it *could*,
it is in our mission statement that it should *not*.
