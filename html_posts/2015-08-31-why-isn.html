**Content:** [Seatbelts became mandatory for all occupants in the front
of a car after a very expensive, targeted grassroots campaign entitled
\"Seatbelts save lives.\" Legislators, not wanting to miss the boat,
passed laws that state that seatbelts must be worn by all occupants in
the front row of a car. Back seat seatbelt requirement differ by state.
Most at least require children to wear them.\
\
In general, **laws that protect you from you are bad laws.** The purpose
of laws in a civil society are to protect you from me, and vice versa.
Seatbelt laws protect you from you. In general, these are silly laws. We
all know that you\'re safer if you wear your seatbelt than if you
don\'t. But a law to make you safer? That\'s a *nanny state* law.\
\
The one exception is children. We all know that parents don\'t always do
what\'s best for their kids. Laws that require all children under 18
wear seatbelts at all times in all seating positions are fine. The other
exception might be the driver. Forcing the driver to wear a seatbelt
might keep the driver in his seat longer, and thus keep him in control
of the vehicle longer, in the event of a crash. However, these instances
where a seatbelt might keep a driver in his seat and in control during a
crashare dubious at best.\
\
There is no concerted effort to mandate anything for motorcycle riders.
In fact, states are split on helmet usage; not all states require riders
to wear helmets. Again, helmet laws protect you from you, and so in
general, are bad law.\
\
In all actuality, helmets are useful. They keep the head intact for
easier victim identification. As macabre is it may seem, anyone with
half a brain knows that a high speed motorcycle accident will almost
certainly result in death for the rider.]{.rendered_qtext}
