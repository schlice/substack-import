**Content:** [In general in the United States, in a public place like on
a sidewalk or in a park, the general rule is ***if you can see it, you
can shoot it***. There are certain exceptions, like pictures of certain
government installations (not monuments) and the like, and especially if
it is posted that you can\'t record there. For the most part, however,
if you can see it, you can record it. There is no reasonable expectation
of privacy on a public sidewalk.\
\
If a private property is open to the public, you can generally take
pictures there unless it is explicitly posted that you may not.\
\
You can post your recordings online. No consent is required from the
person who was recorded. If you wanted to show off your sidewalk
pictures on Quora, that is perfectly legal. However, you can\'t post
something that is *libelous*, or paints someone in a negative light. You
also can\'t expose secrets or private information about someone, like
your favorite movie star leaving an AA meeting.\
\
It\'s a decidedly gray area whether or not you can take pictures of
people who are inside buildings, if they are standing near open or
unblocked windows. State laws vary on this point. In general, you do not
have a reasonable expectation of privacy if you are standing in front of
an open window. But if you are in a location where you do have a
reasonable expectation of privacy, like a bathroom, some states still
say that the privacy expectation attaches, even if the window is open.\
\
What you cannot do:\
]{.rendered_qtext}

- You can\'t record/photograph people when they have a reasonable
  expectation of privacy, like while they are in a house with the blinds
  drawn, but there\'s a small crack between the blinds and using your
  telephoto lens you can see inside.
- You cannot charge for your pictures. If you do, you must have consent
  from everyone who you have photographed. If you\'re going to make a
  movie and sell it, everyone must have signed a release to use their
  likeness for commercial gain. You can sell your pictures to news
  organizations or use them for art, although you are highly encouraged
  to get releases anyway.
- You also can\'t take pictures of some landmarks and in National Parks
  and then sell those pictures without a permit (which costs money).

This is not an exhaustive list, and local rules vary, so always check
before you shoot.\
\
So can you take a picture of a woman\'s butt while she walks down the
sidewalk? Yep, perfectly legal. Albeit creepy and a bit stalker-ish, but
legal nonetheless. You can even post them to \"womensbutts.com\" if you
choose, as long as you don\'t reveal their identity or photograph their
faces (or get paid for posting), as that might be considered painting
someone in a negative light.
