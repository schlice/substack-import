The Supreme Court has ruled that there are two portions of the Second
Amendment: a **prefatory clause** and an **operative clause.**

The **prefatory clause** says, *"A well-regulated militia, being
essential to the security of a free State"*.

The **operative clause** says, *"...the right of the People to keep and
bear Arms shall not be infringed."*

The court also ruled that the prefatory clause does nothing at all to
change or alter the meaning or the force of the operative clause.

The interpretation of the Second Amendment that favors gun control
simply forgets that interpretation by the court. It holds that the
prefatory clause is actually operative, and in today's day and age, that
would mean that guns would only be limited to "a well-regulated
militia." Therefore, guns would only be available to members of the
militia (i.e. police, National Guard, the military, etc).

However, there are some problems with this definition.

The operative clause contains the phrase "the right of the People". This
phrase was used three times in the Bill of Rights, and every time it was
used, it denotes a right that is possessed by all people simply by being
citizens, not by membership in some group or organization.

Secondly, if we look to US law, the militia was intended to be everyone.
In fact, under current US code, the *unorganized militia* consists of
*everyone in the country*. So by our own definition of what the militia
is (based on what we wrote into our own laws), everyone is in the
militia, and therefore everyone has the right to keep and bear arms.

These are just some of the reasons that the court, in *DC v Heller,*
found that the Second Amendment recognizes an *individual right* to keep
and bear arms.
