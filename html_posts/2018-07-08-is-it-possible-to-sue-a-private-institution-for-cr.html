**Is it possible to sue a private institution for cruel and unusual
punishment?**

In the United States, you can sue anyone for violating rights or
violating laws, causing you monetary damage.

The question: how likely are you to prevail?

I really don't see a scenario where a private institution could be
guilty of cruel and unusual punishment. The reason: "cruel and unusual
punishment" is a phrase from the Eighth Amendment, and it normally
applies to how the government treats prisoners. After you're convicted
and in jail, the Constitution says you still must be treated humanely.

Very few private institutions that I know of are incarcerating people,
and thus even in a position in which they could be punishing someone in
a "cruel and unusual" way. It's highly unlikely that a claim of cruel
and unusual punishment would prevail against a private institution.
