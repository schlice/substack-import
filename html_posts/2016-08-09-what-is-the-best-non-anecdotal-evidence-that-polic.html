There isn't any "non-anecdotal" evidence that police brutality is
running rampant. Because it's *all anecdotal*.

No one collects statistics about "police brutality" that I know of,
because there is no one definition of "police brutality" since it's
really an opinion. There is only crime and violation of policy. "Police
brutality" is very much a media-coined term like "assault weapons."
Search police brutality in the Google and you'll find media reports.
It's all media-created hype. You may see a video of an officer taking
down a criminal. And it looks violent. It looks painful. You may think,
"wow, police brutality." But it's all perfectly legal, and complies with
department policy. Takedowns are never pretty. They always look way
worse than they really are. But they stop the bad guy with the minimum
amount of collateral damage and the minimum amount of injury to the bad
guy himself (if it's not a lethal force takedown).

You might be able to find tallies of police officers convicted of
murder, but beyond that there is no single agency overseeing all 17,985
state and local police departments across the United States, so there
are no consistent statistics that show this. Perhaps the US Justice
Department may have such statistics.

Perhaps someone can get them.
