**Content:** [Taxes (and what you pay) are based on the state in which
you earn the income, not your state of legal residence.\
\
You generally have to file a **return for your state of residence**
(assuming it collects state income tax). If your state of legal
residence is Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, Washington,
or Wyoming, you don\'t pay state income tax.\
\
In addition, New Hampshire and Tennessee only tax interest and dividend
income, not wages or earnings:\
]{.rendered_qtext}

- New Hampshire collects tax on interest and dividend income exceeding
  \$2,400 (\$4800 for joint filers) plus additional exemptions for age,
  blindness and disability.
- Tennessee collects tax on interest income from bonds, notes and
  dividends from stock exceeding \$1,250 (\$2,500 for joint filers).
  \[1\]

Generally, you have to file a **nonresident state tax return** if:\

- You earned income in a state that is not your resident state.
- Your employer incorrectly withheld taxes for a state that is not your
  resident state.
- You had gambling winnings in a state that is not your resident state.
- You owned rental property in a state that is not your resident state.
- You are a partner in a partnership, or a shareholder in an
  S-Corporation, that is based in a state that is not your resident
  state.
- You received income from an estate or trust that has interest in a
  state that is not your resident state. \[2\]\

You do not generally have to file a return for the state where your
employer is located *unless* you also work there. What matters is where
you earned the income, not where your employer is based.\
\
You generally have to file a **part-year resident tax return** for each
state you lived in:

- If you moved from one state to another state, you will probably need
  to file a part-year resident tax return for both states.
- If you lived in multiple states, you will probably need to file a
  part-year resident return for each state.\
