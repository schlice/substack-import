This is a common misunderstanding of this verse, and it's due to Leonard
Cohen.

Leonard Cohen wrote a song about the story of David and Bathsheba called
*Hallelujah* in 1984. It wasn't very popular until John Cale re-released
the song in 1991, which was featured in the movie *Shrek*. The song's
popularity took off after that.[\[1\]](#aNPFt){#cite-aNPFt

At the beginning of verse 2, the lyrics go:

> Your faith was strong but you needed proof,\
> You saw her bathing on the roof,\
> Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya.

The second line contains a **misplaced modifier** (probably in order to
make it rhyme). In the actual story from the Bible, *David* was the one
on the roof, and he saw Bathsheba, *in a house lower than where he was,*
taking a bath:

> One evening David got up from his bed and walked around on the roof of
> the palace. From the roof he saw a woman bathing. The woman was very
> beautiful. --- 2 Samuel 11:2 NIV

Misplaced modifiers are common English language issues. Here's another
example of a misplaced modifier: **purple women's shoes**. Purple is the
misplaced modifier, because when you say it like that, it looks like the
women are purple, not the shoes. Similarly, when you say "You saw her
bathing on the roof," it sounds like she was on the roof, not you seeing
her from your own roof.
