**How is Pedophilia bad? Like you like kids and? I don\'t see it as bad
if you aren\'t being a predator or molester.**

Let's be crystal clear. Pedophilia is not a crime. But it is a mental
disorder.

Pedophilia is the mental condition which causes an adult to be sexually
attracted to a pre-pubescent child.

So pedophilia, by itself, is not a crime because it is simply a
condition whereby an adult finds his or herself sexually attracted to
children who have not yet reached puberty. It is a mental condition and
should be treated by a psychiatrist and a therapist.

Pedophilia, however, can lead to crime if it is not treated. We should
encourage pedophiles to get treatment before they engage in damaging
criminal activity.
