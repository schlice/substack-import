**Content:** [It is legal to ostracize people who offend you. It may
actually be the only way that you can communicate to some people that
they are offensive.\
\
In commerce, it is not legal to refuse service to someone if they are a
member of a protected class (race, color, creed, sex, national origin,
and in some states, sexual orientation). So it is not legal to say
\"Blacks offend me, I will not serve them\" in your restaurant.\
\
Otherwise, you and your group can absolutely refuse to do business with
someone who offends you. There is no requirement that you engage in
business with someone. That\'s called a \"boycott\" and it is perfectly
legal and an appropriate free-market response to personal
offense.]{.rendered_qtext}
