Sure!

You know what else we could do? We could say that only people with *some
skin in the game* should be able to affect the outcome of the country.
So you can only vote if you **own land**. Then, only people *who have
something to lose* can vote.

And we certainly don't want people with no money voting to give
themselves federal dollars, so only people with money should vote. Yeah,
you should have to pay a fee to vote. We can call it a *poll tax*
because Congress is able to levy taxes. It's right there in the
Constitution.

Oh wait. They already said all of these things violate the Equal
Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.

Darn. I guess the law really does apply to all citizens then, regardless
of education level.
