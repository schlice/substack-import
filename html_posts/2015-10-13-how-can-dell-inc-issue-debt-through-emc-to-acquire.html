Not sure where you got your information, but Dell is not \"issuing debt
through EMC.\" Dell, along with their equity capital partners, are
essentially acquiring new debt to finance this deal. Dell will spend the
next few years following the completion of this transaction (which is
expected to be 2Q16) paying down that debt, but their expected revenue
from the combined operation more than permits them to pay down that
debt. The eight or so banks that have already signed agreements with
Dell to finance the deal seem to think so, anyway.]{.rendered_qtext}
