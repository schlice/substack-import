**If someone steals your car and replaces it\'s license plates with an
identical cars plates, would a routine traffic stop notice the car is
stolen?**

No, probably not noticed during a routine stop.

The plates will be registered to a similar make/model/color. But the VIN
on the insurance card won't match the VIN on the registration, so a cop
who is paying attention should pick that up and look further.
