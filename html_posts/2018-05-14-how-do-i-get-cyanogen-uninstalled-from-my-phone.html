**How do I get Cyanogen uninstalled from my phone?**

The same way you got Cyanogen on to your phone. Pick a new operating
system and install it onto your phone.

I assume that if you're installing Cyanogen in the first place that
you're comfortable with installing custom operating systems on your
phone (which is perfectly fine with me).

May I suggest

the now-discontinued CyanogenMod project.
