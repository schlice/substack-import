**Content:** [Some officers do struggle with this. Can you blame them?
They deal with the worst of the worst in society, every single day,
***so you don\'t have to.*** They do this willingly. Most of these
people are harmless, but some are hardened criminals who would just as
soon kill a cop than go back to jail (again). Statistics vary as to just
how many officers are affected in this way, as medical records are
confidential, and most offers are less-than-willing to talk about such
shortcomings with anyone, much less statistic-takers.\
\
There are programs that officers can avail themselves of to assist them
with dealing with these types of emotional issues. Our department has an
on-staff psychiatrist (who is an awesome lady, by the way) who handles
all the \"required\" interactions, such as use of force incidents where
a suspect dies, and the \"non-required\" interactions, where officers
can talk to her when they start feeling the stress and strain of the
job. There are other work/life programs that are also offered by the
department.]{.rendered_qtext}
