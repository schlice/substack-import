It\'s more than just a \"chain of command\" issue.

The National Guard does not work for the President. The President is not
the Commander in Chief of any state National Guard. The Governor of that
state is the Commander in Chief of that state\'s National Guard. For the
National Guard, the buck stops with the Governor.

The President can (and routinely does) request States to contribute
their fully-trained military members during wartime. The Posse Comitatus
Act does not specifically prohibit this sort of action. It prohibits the
military from being asked to perform state police functions. However, it
would not prohibit the National Guard from enforcing state law.

And in its original construction, the National Guard (which is a formal
outgrowth of the militia of all of the people) was a standing army set
in place to counter a threat from the federal standing army. Remember,
some people were concerned that a standing army could be used against
the people (like the King did with his Redcoats).
