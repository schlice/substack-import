So as usual, the Quora Prompt Generator loves to talk about Christian
truth as "opinion." But Christian belief is not opinion. It is God's
word.

In that respect, these answers aren't "opinion" as informed by
"history." They are theologically sound, and Biblically-written. That
doesn't make it easy to hear. But it does make it the truth. Thanks,
QPG. Failed again.

So let's get into the meat of the QPG's rather impersonal question,
first starting whether Christians "should" be "anti-abortion" and then
whether Christians "should" be "anti-gay."

\

We can start with Christians being "anti-abortion." First, we must
acknowledge that these are very difficult decisions for women. A woman
who finds herself in such a position has an awful lot to wrestle with.
So I don't want to be insensitive when I discuss this. However, the
question was asked about Christian belief, not about sensitivity to a
woman's feelings. To that end, please forgive me if this sounds
insensitive.

As a Christian, I don't prefer any of this "anti" language. I'd rather
be known for what I stand ***for***, rather than what I stand
***against*.**

And I stand for life.

Rather than me re-typing everything, the good folks at

comprehensive list of why Christians stand for life. I absolutely
believe this, and if I were to write it all out, it would be this:

So again, truth is not subject to what anyone thinks or feels. God's
Word is truth. Christians believe that, and therefore, Christians are
pro-life because God's Word says clearly that we are to honor the lives
He has created. We know that ultimately, everyone will stand in front of
the seat of judgement and will have to answer for how they lived their
lives.

And it's not enough to say, "If you don't want an abortion, don't get
one," because if you truly believe that life is a gift from God and no
one is to destroy what God has made, then allowing others to destroy
what God has made is just as wrong as if we do it ourselves.

\

Now about being "anti-gay."

That's a bit of a loaded question. Christians are not "anti-gay."
Christians are "anti-sin." The Bible is replete with admonitions against
homosexual behavior and to claim otherwise is simply a flat-out lie (all
quotes from NIV):

> Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman; that
> is detestable. --- Leviticus 18:22
>
> If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman,
> both of them have done what is detestable. They are to be put to
> death; their blood will be on their own heads. --- Leviticus 20:13
>
> Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of
> God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters
> nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men nor thieves nor the
> greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the
> kingdom of God. --- 1 Corinthians 6:9-10
>
> We also know that the law is made not for the righteous but for
> lawbreakers and rebels, the ungodly and sinful, the unholy and
> irreligious, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for
> murderers, for the sexually immoral, for those practicing
> homosexuality, for slave traders and liars and perjurers---and for
> whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine --- 1 Timothy 1:9-10

And lest you think that only gay men are implicated in the Bible,
lesbians are also specifically called out:

> Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their
> women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. In the
> same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were
> inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with
> other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.
> --- Romans 1:26--27

Again, drawing our lessons from the anti-abortion message, Christians
are not in opposition to homosexual activity on a whim. We are against
all sin. We don't want to see anyone sin. And we believe that Christ has
the ability and the power to help us overcome any of our sin.

And while we love everyone, we will not condone sin. We will not
encourage sin. We do not excuse sin. We do not "look the other way" when
someone who claims to be a Christian lives a life of sin. If you are
truly saved, you will not desire your sin more than you desire God.

The American church has a huge problem with this. They believe that if
we permit and participate and tacitly condone sin, the sinner will see
our love and will want to change on their own. This is flawed thinking.

Does that make us "anti-gay" or does that make us "anti-sin"? I'll leave
it up to you to decide.

But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord (Joshua 24:15).
