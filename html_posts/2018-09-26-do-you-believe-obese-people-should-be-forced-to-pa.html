**Do you believe obese people should be forced to pay for an extra seat
when flying?**

The problem with obesity is that it sometimes is uncontrollable, and it
is sometimes behavioral but controllable. So it's difficult to talk
about what obese people must do, because it seems to be intrinsically
unfair to the obese people who have no control over their weight.

So let's change the terminology a little and see if we can understand
what needs to be done.

What do *extremely tall people* do to fly?

Your height is completely out of your control, so it's less of a
controversial topic than your weight. And tall people have just as many
issues these days as obese people, with rapidly declining seat pitch
(the distance between seats) and seemingly no way to stop it from
continuing without government intervention.

So what do extremely tall people do? They either buy seat upgrades to
seats with more legroom, avoid flying altogether (some will take the
train or a bus), or wedge themselves into a standard seat.

But we don't hear calls to *force* them to purchase a premium seat,
because in general, a tall person, while personally uncomfortable,
doesn't impact the comfort of his surrounding passengers.

We only hear calls to force obese passengers to purchase an upgrade
because it impacts the comfort of surrounding passengers.

I can vouch for that discomfort: I was squished between two obese
passengers in the last row of a 737. It was the most claustrophobic,
worst flight I have ever taken, and I've flown in aircraft which
couldn't land because the turbulence was so bad (and we tried three
times). And these two gentlemen felt bad for me. They were very
accommodating; they allowed me a few moments of reprieve to get out and
air my head during the flight, but getting into and out of those seats
was a chore for them too.

However, this doesn't change my opinion that *forcing* an obese customer
to purchase two seats is not right.

If you can fit into the seat and buckle your seatbelt (even with an
extender), you can sit there. If you are personally inconvenienced by an
obese passenger next to you, talk to a flight attendant. If there is
room, the flight attendants have far more flexibility to re-seat you
once the doors close than the gate agents. If there isn't room, be
certain to express your inconvenience. They'll do what they can to
either offer you vouchers or whatever they have the ability to do to
make up for your inconvenience. Despite their sometimes uncaring fa√ßade,
they know that they have to do everything they can to retain passenger
loyalty. Margins in the airline industry are razor thin; I saw a report
that said that airlines make around \$4/passenger in profit. The only
way they can sustain that sort of business is volume, and for that, you
need passengers. They simply can't afford to lose passengers to poor
customer service.

Now, back to the obese customer. *If they can't fit in the seat,* they
will either need to buy an upgraded seat in a section where they can fit
into the seats, buy two seats next to each other, or avoid flying.

We can always inform the flight crew if we are inconvenienced by another
passenger, but we certainly should not be demanding that *others* pay
more to aid in *our* comfort.
