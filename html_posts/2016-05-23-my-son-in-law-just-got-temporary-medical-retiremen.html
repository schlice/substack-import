I think he should visit the nearest MPF (Military Personnel Facility) on
the nearest Air Force installation he can find so that he can confirm
his status, and if it's wrong, get it corrected.

There's only a number of statuses he can currently be in. He could be
out processing, which means he's in the process of (but has not yet
completed) out-processing. Usually this is done with a checklist which
must be signed by every organization that you may still have business
with on active duty. You turn this in to the personnel specialist in the
MPF, who will complete your out-processing and provide you with a DD214.

If he is not out-processing at all (or has not done any out-processing),
he could be in transit between duty stations. He could be in transit to
a TDY. Whatever the case may be, MPF can help him determine his current
status. He should be on orders and have a copy of those orders in hand
in order to facilitate the transition into the new location. And he'd
probably know about it, too.

If he is not out-processing **and** is not on orders to or from
somewhere, then he must be either at a duty station, on leave (with
orders), or at the clinic. If he does not fit any of the above
categories, he is AWOL. The longer he stays AWOL, the more trouble he
will be in.

Best advice: get down to the nearest MPF at the nearest Air Force
installation he can find. They will help him sort it out. Have him bring
whatever paperwork he has with him, as this will help him prove what he
thinks he should be doing.
