**Content:** [It really depends on the phone.\
\
If it\'s an Apple, LG, Motorola or a Samsung phone in the US, it\'s
exceedingly unlikely that your phone has been hacked. Unless you have
jailbroken/rooted your phone, there isn\'t a way to access the
multi-user \"shell\" that allows commands to be executed.\
\
If you are using a Google Nexus phone, the phone uses a version of
Android that is much closer to \"stock\" Android as released by Google.
There may be more unpatched security holes in stock Android; however,
your phone gets updates more frequently. That said, you still only have
serious issues if you have a rooted phone.\
\
Malware (a malicious app on your phone) may allow this, but again it\'s
exceedingly unlikely that you have this on your phone, especially if you
are not jailbroken/rooted.\
\
If your phone is jailbroken/rooted, the easiest way to remove hacker
access is to unroot it/unjailbreak it.]{.rendered_qtext}
