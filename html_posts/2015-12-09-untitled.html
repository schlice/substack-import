<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [IF you actually follow that advice to the letter, then the
dispatcher will contact the pursuing officer and advise him that the
driver is in phone contact with them which is why they didn\'t stop
right away. So assuming this is the advice they follow, AND once the 911
operator identifies that the person following them is in fact an
officer, AND once you get that information, you stop right away, you are
okay. If you still get charged with evading, you can use the recording
of the 911 call as evidence that you were making a good-faith effort to
determine whether or not you were being followed by an actual police
officer, and given the location and the time of day, it was reasonable
for you to do so.]{.rendered_qtext}
