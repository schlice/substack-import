While there are no national numbers, vaccination rates from some of the
largest police departments in the country lag behind the vaccination
rates in the general populations in which they
serve.[\[1\]](#RpLVc){#cite-RpLVc .citation_link}

There's no clear reason why law enforcement in particular would avoid
the jab.

Police officers, either by their nature or through their on-the-job
conditioning, are a very skeptical bunch. And after working with
citizens' rights every single day, they have a fair understanding of
what their own rights are (probably better than we do in many cases).
From what we are hearing from some of the largest police unions in the
country, it's not the shot they oppose, but the *mandates*. Mandates
only drive skepticism higher.

*If it's so good for me*, they say, *then why do you need to mandate
it?*
