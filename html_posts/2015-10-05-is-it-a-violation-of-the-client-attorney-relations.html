**Content:** [While this question borders on a specific question,
generally speaking it is legal.\
\
Whether or not it is considered misrepresentation is another thing
altogether.\
\
If you specifically told your attorney, in writing, that you didn\'t
want an order filed, your attorney received your request, understood
your request, and then filed anyway, it may certainly qualify as
malpractice. But it may not: the court may have ordered him to file an
amended order. We don\'t know, and answering any more specifically
borders on \"specific legal questions\" which shouldn\'t be asked here.\
\
So what can you do?\
\
- File a complaint with the state attorney\'s licensing and disciplining
agency. Every state has an agency which licenses attorneys and also
provides disciplinary actions. For some states, it\'s the bar
association. For others, it\'s the state supreme court. Most of these
agencies won\'t actually act unless the violation was egregious (i.e.
didn\'t show up in court, has a drug problem, etc). And they move at the
speed of government, so expect to not hear from them for some time.
They\'re not at all interested in \"speedy resolution\" of issues.\
\
- Alternatively, get a second opinion. Hire a second attorney to review
the work of the first. It\'s not all that expensive: an hour or two in
consultation with you plus time reviewing documents. And it will help
you decide what to do about your primary attorney.\
\
Suing for malpractice is tough. You have to have lost your case and lost
money in order to sue. You have to prove that your lawyer screwed up,
and you have to prove that you would have won your case otherwise. Plus,
it\'s often very expensive to sue for malpractice.]{.rendered_qtext}
