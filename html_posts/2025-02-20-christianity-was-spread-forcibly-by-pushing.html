No, not at all.

The passage in Luke is a historical account of Jesus discussing the
kingdom of God. By using a parable, Jesus is explaining that He can't
take His throne now, he has to die, be resurrected, ascend into heaven,
and then wait until the time is right for Him to return (Luke 24:50--53;
Revelation 19:11--16).

When Christianity was spread by force during the time between 400 AD and
1500 AD, it was spread for a different reason. This was during the time
that the Latin Church insisted on universal Christianity. It was
perceived, at the time, that "religious aliens," or unbelievers, were
"contaminating" Christianity, and there was widespread intolerance by
church and state authorities, mobs, and vigilante groups.

\

In short, it wasn't any Bible passage that caused people to spread
Christianity by force. It was **sin**. It was the sin of pride, and its
resulting intolerance by people.
