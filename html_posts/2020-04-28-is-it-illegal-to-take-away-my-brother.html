**Is it illegal to take away my mentally ill brother's gun?**

Yes. This is called *theft*.

You may have a *justification* for your actions (namely that your
brother is "mentally ill"). But if your brother is mentally ill to the
point where firearms possession is unlawful, then you can engage the
police to take his guns. You would rather have his guns seized than have
him hurt himself or others, right?

Now, if he has never been determined by a court to be a "mental
defective," then he is not so mentally ill as to be unable to possess a
firearm. He may be dangerous, but not an unlawful gun owner. Taking his
guns at this point would have no justification whatsoever, and you could
be rightly arrested for theft.

You may think you're doing the right thing, but you didn't ask if it was
the right thing. You asked if it was illegal.

If you want it to be legal, he would have to be declared "mentally
defective" by a court.

(EDIT) Some states have enacted so-called "Red Flag Laws" which allow
you to make a report to the government that your brother is a danger to
himself and others, and *with that report alone*, the police can seize
his guns. He would then have to argue that he is *capable of having his
property returned to him*, which often takes a long period of time. We
can argue the Constitutionality (or lack thereof) of these laws, but
until the courts rule them to be unconstitutional, some states have
them, and you can use them to protect your mentally ill brother until
they are overturned in court. If your state has "Red Flag Laws," you
should investigate how to petition to have someone's guns removed.
