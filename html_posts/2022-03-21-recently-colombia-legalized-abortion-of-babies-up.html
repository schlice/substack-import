First of all, there are no international "laws." There are only
international agreements about certain things which can be accepted or
not by individual nations.

Secondly, the closest thing to international agreement about life is the
UN and its *Universal Declaration of Human Rights* (UDHR).

However, it is intentionally ambiguous on when life begins, and whether
or not they regard that life as protected.

For example, Article 1 says, "All human beings are born free and equal
in dignity and rights." The UN Human Rights Committee, an organization
within the UN which deals with treaties, reminds us that the language
says that all human beings are ***born*** free, thus their human rights
do not begin until birth. However, the UDHR does not explicitly say
this.

Then, Article 2 says, "Everyone is entitled to all the rights and
freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind,
such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other
opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status." We
should note that it clearly says that everyone is entitled to all the
rights and freedoms in the UDHR, without distinction of **birth**. To
me, this is a plain reading that you don't have to be born in order to
be entitled to the rights in the UDHR.

Of course, Article 3 says, "Everyone has the right to life, liberty and
security of person." They do not clarify who "everyone" is. Is it only
those who are covered by Article 1, or does that mean "everyone,"
including the unborn?

So even the United Nations, which is the closest body to any
representing any sort of international understanding of the issue, is
conspicuously vague about exactly to whom these rights apply.

No matter, because the UDHR is just *boilerplate* for nations to build
their own, *binding*, human rights documents. Sovereign nations can
still do as they choose, and Columbia is no exception.
