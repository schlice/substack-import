Short answer: **NO.**

The ready availability of handguns does not increase the risk that
people will commit suicide.

It increases the **ease** with which people can commit suicide. It also
increases the risk that people will be **successful** at suicide;
firearms are the most successful method of suicide, with nearly an
80--90% success rate worldwide.

However, the method used varies worldwide, mostly based on the ready
availability of the agent used to commit suicide. The popularity of
handgun suicide in the United States is indeed linked to the
availability of handguns. The popularity of poisoning suicide in South
America is linked to the ready availability of poisons commonly used in
agriculture.

However, worldwide, hanging is the most common method of suicide,
accounting for 53% of the male suicides, and 39% of the female suicides.
Suffocation and hanging, next to firearms, is the second most successful
method of suicide, with a 60--85% success rate. Drowning is a form of
suffocation.

So, the burning question: if you get rid of handguns, will suicides
decrease?

If you look worldwide, there is no indication that removing one agent
used for suicide will decrease numbers of suicides. It increases the
risk that people will turn to other forms of suicide. In the United
States, hangings will increase for males, and poisonings will increase
for females, if 300 million handguns mysteriously disappeared.

The tool makes it **easier**. It doesn't make it **possible.**
