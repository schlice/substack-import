Generally, a crime is committed somewhere that is covered by laws.
Sometimes, crimes are committed between jurisdictions, such as in
international waters, or international airspace. In such a circumstance,
the countries with jurisdiction will decide how to prosecute the case.

International corporations still maintain a headquarters somewhere, and
are bound by the laws of some country.
