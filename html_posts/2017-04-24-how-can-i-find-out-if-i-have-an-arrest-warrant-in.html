If you would like to be a little less "direct" than my esteemed
colleague [[Tim
Dees](https://www.quora.com/profile/Tim-Dees)]{.qlink_container}
suggests, then perhaps you could instead contact the municipal court in
South Bend and ask them.

It will be then up to you to do the right thing and surrender yourself
to law enforcement if you do find you have a warrant for your arrest.
After you have grabbed your toothbrush.
