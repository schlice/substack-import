> **Is there a country that uses a mainstream Bible**

No "country" uses one Bible translation. There are hundreds of
translations of the Bible

> **that\'s translated unquestionably**

If a translation of the Bible changes facts, then that's not a
translation. That's a modification.

No translation is "unquestionable." Some languages have more words than
others. For example, translation from Greek is sometimes difficult as
they have multiple words for "love" where we only have one.

> **so that the verses about same-sex relations are confirming and not
> damming?**

So this one is easy to answer:

***The Bible unquestionably says that homosexuality is a sin.***

That said, **love the sinner, hate the sin.** In other words, your sin
is between you and God. It is not my place to judge you. That is God's
job. It's also not my place to translate the Bible in an acceptable way.
It's also not my place to help you find a modified Bible that makes a
homosexual feel better about their sin.

It is only my place to tell you what the Bible says, and to tell you
that we love you and we are all sinners. We have all fallen short of
God's expectations for us. But God loves you, and we want you to know
that if you have accepted Christ as your savior, then your sins are
forgiven, *but you must go and sin no more* as Jesus commanded.

The Bible is very clear, in multiple books across multiple centuries,
that homosexuality is a sin. No translation of the Bible will change
that. Living as if it is not is living outside of God's commands. The
answer is not to change the Bible to suit you. The answer is to change
you to suit the Bible.

I'm not suggesting conversion therapy. What you do and how you do it are
not up to me. I'm not even advising you do or not do anything. I'm
simply here to love you as a brother or a sister, and to bring you to
Christ. The rest is up to him.
