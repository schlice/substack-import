**Do you have a military heritage?**

Yes, but it skipped a generation.

My grandparents were all in the military. My grandfather (on my mother's
side) was in the Army; he was a truck driver. My grandfather (on my
father's side) was in the Navy running a supply ship. My grandmother (on
my father's side) was in the Army and used to sing on Armed Forces Radio
during WWII.

My parents were service-oriented, just not in the military. My dad was a
cop and my mom was a teacher.
