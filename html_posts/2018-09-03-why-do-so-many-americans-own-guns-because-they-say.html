**Why do so many Americans own guns because they say the 2nd amendment
gives them that right, its like saying I own cows because the government
lets me?**

If people say that, it's a distinction without a difference.

In fact, the Constitution doesn't "give" you rights. The rights existed
before the Constitution; the Bill of Rights ensures that the government
cannot "infringe" on the rights you already have.

It's just easier to say that I have the "right" to do something because
of the Constitution, when in fact, the Constitution merely ensures that
your right (which was pre-existent) cannot be infringed by the
government.

But while the government cannot prevent you from owning a gun (in most
circumstances), they would have to let you own cows. I'm certain that
there's at least one zoning law which would have to be followed in order
to own a cow.
