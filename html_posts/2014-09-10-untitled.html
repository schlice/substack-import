**Content:** [Soldiers aren\'t forced to be exposed to chemicals that
will affect them for the rest of their lives. Yes, in war there is risk,
and some of it is acceptable risk. Are you saying that all risk in war
is acceptable risk?\
\
\<devils_advocate\> So you\'re saying that we shouldn\'t take care of
our military veterans who have been exposed to harmful agents during the
course of their military service? Should we take care of anyone who is
exposed to any harmful agents during the course of their occupations? I
mean, they signed up for the job, the consequences are expected, right?
Should we not install guard rails along the sides of high-rise
construction projects? I mean, no one forced them up there by gunpoint,
if you fall, it\'s just a consequence of working on an unfinished
high-rise, right?\
\
Navy shipbuilders breathed asbestos dust during their tenures and now
have mesothelioma (a lung cancer specifically caused by exposure to
airborne asbestos). Is your contention that this should just be
considered an occupational hazard?\
\
Military members (like myself) are developing multiple sclerosis at a
higher rate than non military members, and so the VA considers
developing MS within 7 years of leaving Active Duty a service-connected
disability. Is this right, in your opinion?
