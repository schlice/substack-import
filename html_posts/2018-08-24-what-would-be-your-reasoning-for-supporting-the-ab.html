**What would be your reasoning for supporting the ability to 3D print
your guns, or ghost guns, as the media calls it? I am pro-2a but can\'t
see the reasoning behind this specifically as it seems too drastic.**

The reasoning is simple. **The threat to the 1st Amendment is far
greater than the threat posed by a 3-D printed gun.**

Perhaps at some point in the distant future, you'll be able to print all
of the parts for an actual, metallic gun, that will stand up to more
than one round being passed through it.

But current technology does not allow you to print much more than
plastic, and those won't stand up to the pressures exerted by a bullet.
You might get one or two shots out of it before it explodes.

You can 3-D print aluminum, but the process is difficult and expensive.
You could literally buy ten firearms for the cost of printing the parts
for one.

More importantly, in order to prevent people from 3-D printing guns, you
would have to prevent the digital media files from being distributed.
And [[digital media files (i.e. code) is free
speech.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3f3910&url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/next/tech/is-code-free-speech/){.external_link

don't like, or fear, the content, poses a greater threat to the 1st
Amendment than to your personal safety.

Let's not forget: you can already build your own guns at home. You can
buy a [[80%
lower](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3c0480&url=https://www.80percentarms.com/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="80percentarms.com"}]{.qlink_container} which with a little
bit of metal smithing, you can turn into a functional lower (the only
part of a semi-automatic rifle considered a "gun"). You can buy all the
rest of the pieces online (no permission needed to buy gun parts except
for the lower). There: a "ghost gun."

And you can build a "zip gun" for about \$20 in parts from the hardware
store. By the way: if the zombie apocalypse ever comes, find me. I'll
build you a really good zip gun for whatever the new currency is in the
post-apocalyptic zombie world. I'll be in my doomsday bunker.

If someone wants to make a gun at home, there are a lot better ways to
do it than 3-D printing one.
