**Content:** [The presence or absence of security at the entrance to a
building does not alter the requirements under ADA. Businesses must
still provide access to disabled persons at any public accommodation.\
\
So the key to whether or not the business needs to provide
accommodations to customers is whether or not the business is considered
a \"public accommodation.\" If it is a business, and the business
receives customers at their business location, it is likely that they
fall under ADA guidelines and must provide accommodations. You will need
to consult with the Disability office in your state to determine if the
business is considered a public accommodation and is bound by ADA.\
\
That doesn\'t relieve the business from providing exactly the same
accommodations to employees.]{.rendered_qtext}
