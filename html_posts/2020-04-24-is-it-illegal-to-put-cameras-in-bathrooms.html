**Is it illegal to put a camera in your own bathroom?**

The answer is pretty much yes (it is illegal) in virtually any
circumstance you can imagine.

If you can guarantee that you'll be the only person ever to use it, you
might be able to get away with it, because no one will ever know or
care.

But if anyone else is ever going to use your bathroom, you cannot.
People have an expectation of privacy in a bathroom or a locker room, so
cameras are not allowed.
