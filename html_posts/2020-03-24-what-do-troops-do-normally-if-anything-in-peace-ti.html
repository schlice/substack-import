**What do troops do normally, if anything, in peace time if they can now
be sent out to support the police and emergency services? Why are they
not usefully deployed across the country at all times?**

The Posse Comitatus Act makes it illegal for the military to be used to
execute the law unless specifically authorized by the Constitution or by
an act of Congress. And since we can't even get Congress to agree to an
aid package to assist with COVID-19, I find it hard to believe we'd get
Congress to agree to deploy the military to do anything.

But it can be done. Generally speaking, the military can assist with
things not specifically related to executing the law. They can provide
second-level assistance, while leaving the front lines to the local
police. A state governor can appeal to the Department of Defense and
request assistance.
