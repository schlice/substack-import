Wait, you mean Biden?

That man was experiencing cognitive decline in his second year of
presidency, and his staff and his vice president **covered it up**.
There were many ways to handle it, up to and including invoking the 25th
Amendment. Instead, Democrats chose to ignore it, cover it up, and
gaslight anyone saying anything other than Biden walked on water when he
wasn't in the limelight. You didn't throw Biden under the bus.

This loss sits squarely on a poorly executed Democrat campaign, from
start to finish. Democrats need to realize that every time they point a
finger, three fingers point back at them. They need to do some serious
resetting over the course of the next four years. The course they have
been running on has been clearly and unambiguously repudiated with this
election.

> **acknowledge that every single Trump voter is a piece of garbage**

Identity politics has been repudiated. This election proves clearly and
unambiguously that identity politics is a losing strategy. But hey, feel
free to double down on that idea. The loss two years from now in the
House and four years from now in the White House will *dwarf* what you
saw on November 5th if you hang on to identity politics.

Democrats ran on transgender issues, yet the American voters said
clearly that transgender issues were **literally at the bottom of their
priority list.** The economy topped most voters' lists.
