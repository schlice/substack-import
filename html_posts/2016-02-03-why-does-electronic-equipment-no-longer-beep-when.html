The issue was caused by, and is related to, the type of connection
between the cell phone and the tower. It was called \"interference.\"

Previously, cell phones communicated with their cell towers using an
***analog*** signal. This signal has a much higher amplitude and signal
strength. Certain electronic equipment (like radios, especially) was
specifically designed to pick up analog signals. In fact, at that time,
you could buy a special scanner and actually listen to cell phone calls.

These days, cell phones communicate with their towers using
***digital*** signals. The amplitude of the signal is much smaller, and
the power required to send the signal is also much less, since the
signal only needs to vary between a very small frequency range to
distinguish between a 1 and a 0. This also has contributed to making
cell phones smaller and lighter. Consequently, radios and TVs no longer
can \"hear\" those signals.

\

Funny anecdote, my wife took her car in a few years ago to get serviced,
she never told me why. She got the car back, and was really frustrated
because they couldn\'t reproduce the issue. When I asked her what it
was, we were picking it up from the dealership\'s repair shop. She said
that the radio would infrequently make a terrible buzzing noise, and
while she was describing the issue, it happened. And immediately
thereafter, she got a phone call.

Turns out there was a little \"cubby\" right next to the head unit where
she would store her cell phone. The car stereo would pick up the
incoming call and make a buzzing noise. When I explained to her that the
issue was the placement of her cell phone and the noise was caused by
placing her phone there, moving her phone to the cup holder completely
solved the issue (and could have saved her a trip to the dealer).
