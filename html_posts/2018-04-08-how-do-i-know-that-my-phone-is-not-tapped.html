**How do I know that my phone is not tapped?**

You don't. If you could know, then the tap would be pretty ineffective,
now wouldn't it?

Since you don't know, you should probably avoid talking about your next
big "score" on an unsecured line.

And if you don't know what an "unsecured" vs a "secured" line is, then
you should probably avoid breaking the law in the first place.
