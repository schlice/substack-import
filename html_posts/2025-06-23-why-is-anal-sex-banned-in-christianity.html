*Is it though?*

The problem we have is that "anal sex" is never specifically mentioned
in the Bible. What ***is*** mentioned is "homosexual activity," which
also routinely includes anal sex.

Part of the problem is the story of Sodom, from where the word "sodomy"
comes from. Interestingly, there are no Bible verses that contain the
words "sodomy," "sodomite" or "sodomites," except for the NASB and NKJV
versions. This is because **there are no Hebrew or Greek words that are
properly translated as "sodomy," "sodomite" or "sodomites."** For
example, the NASB translates the Hebrew word *qades* as "sodomites" in 1
Kings 22:46. But *qades* actually refers to temple prostitutes, which
may also include male prostitutes. The word "sodomites" occurs in the
NKJV in 1 Timothy 1:10. But the Greek word translated as "sodomites" is
*arsenokoites* is more properly translated as "homosexuals." Therefore,
most modern Bibles do not include the words "sodomy" or "sodomites."

Yet, the words "sodomy" and "sodomites" have been adopted as a reference
to anal sex. That is, "sodomy" has historically included anal sex, and
the word "sodomy" has been used as a reference to anal sex. When people
hear "sodomy," they naturally think "anal sex." And homosexuality is
commonly associated with anal sex.

But homosexual sex isn't characterized by **what** you do, it's
characterized by **who** you do it with.

Every time the Bible discusses sex, it discusses who you do it with. In
other words, it's either a heterosexual married couple, or it is "men
sleeping with men" or "women sleeping with women." Here's just a few of
the many references to homosexual activity from the Bible:

> Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman; that
> is detestable. --- Leviticus 18:22
>
> If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman,
> both of them have done what is detestable. They are to be put to
> death; their blood will be on their own heads. --- Leviticus 20:13
>
> Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of
> God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters
> nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men nor thieves nor the
> greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the
> kingdom of God. --- 1 Corinthians 6:9-10
>
> We also know that the law is made not for the righteous but for
> lawbreakers and rebels, the ungodly and sinful, the unholy and
> irreligious, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for
> murderers, for the sexually immoral, for those practicing
> homosexuality, for slave traders and liars and perjurers---and for
> whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine --- 1 Timothy 1:9-10
>
> Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their
> women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. In the
> same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were

> --- Romans 1:26--27

The Romans 1 reference is probably the one which might directly condemn
anal sex specifically, as it calls out "exchanging natural relations for
unnatural ones." Since the anus is not designed for the penis, but the
vagina is, you could say that inserting the penis into the anus is
"unnatural relations." However, as I mentioned earlier, all these
passages (including Romans 1) discuss these "unnatural relations" in
terms of men committing shameful acts with other men and women doing the
same. So while anal sex might not be *natural* in terms of intended
function, it is not specifically called out as *sinful*.

I'm not going to get into whether or not a heterosexual Christian
married couple *should* or *should not* engage in anal sex. That's a
personal decision the Christian married couple can prayerfully make
together. We already know that anal sex is riskier than vaginal sex to
overall health. But it can be done safely, carefully, and lovingly. If
the couple chooses together to engage in the activity, in a loving,
God-honoring, and marriage-strengthening way, then it isn't sinful.
