Absolutely. You can say that you have contempt for every judge, police
officer, janitor, and mouse family that has ever stepped foot in that
accursed building, and you\'re perfectly allowed to do so.

Where you would run afoul is if a judge gave you a court order, and you
posted a notice in the paper that you were specifically going to not
follow that court order.

*That* is the definition of "contempt of court.". Not having a general
contempt of any court, or even having a specific contempt of a
particular court.

Contempt of court is a charge when you deliberately ignore or violate a
judge\'s court order.

What if I posted a notice in the newspaper that I have nothing but
contempt for any court, am I within my first amendment rights?
