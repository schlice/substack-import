Correct, the bill would have codified that access to abortions was to
remain legal for the baby's entire 9 months, up to delivery.

Clearly, the bill was not designed to pass. It was designed to create a
talking point for Democrat politicians seeking re-election. "I voted to
codify *Roe* in law, but those evil Republicans voted against it.
Re-elect me and I'll keep fighting for what you believe in." Or the
opposite, "I fought against making *Roe* the law of the land, and those
evil Democrats were really close to passing it. Re-elect me and I'll
keep fighting for what you believe in."

Original question:

The Schumer Abortion Bill that failed to pass listed, among other things
in section 3, the viability of the fetus, was not a limitation to
abortion. So was there there limitation at all? Would this have made
late term abortions legal in all cases?
