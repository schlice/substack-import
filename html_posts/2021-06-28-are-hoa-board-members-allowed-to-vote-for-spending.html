I'm not sure what you mean by "contradicts the CC&Rs" unless you're
claiming that there is a line item which specifically forbids them from
spending the money in the way that they voted to spend it.

Otherwise, if in the name of maintaining the property for which they do
have control, they vote to spend money to do that, it sounds like it
could be considered a reasonable expenditure.

And if the tree removal stops them from spending money in the future,
isn't that a good thing?

So unless there is a specific line item which says they cannot spend
money in the way in which they are spending money, they can probably
spend the money.

But if you think they are wrong and you've already addressed the issue
with them, maybe you and a few of your neighbors can get together and
hire an attorney to address their violation of the CC&Rs and demand an
immediate cease and desist in their violation.
