**Is there any situation where a cop can arrest you and legally not read
you your Miranda rights?**

Yes. That would be *each and every arrest.*

Hollywood got this one completely and totally wrong, and anyone who has
actually been arrested knows the truth.

Cops don't read you your rights when you are arrested, because Miranda
doesn't apply when you are arrested. **Miranda only applies when the
police want to ask you questions**. It's a situation we call "custodial
interrogation." If the police are simply arresting you and have no
desire to ask you any questions, they will not Mirandize you upon
arrest. If they need to ask you questions, they will Mirandize you.

Normally, your Miranda rights are read to you in the interview room, not
at the side of the road. You are given a card which lists exactly what
the detective just told you, and you agree that you heard what he or she
said, and you indicate your choice whether or not you choose to remain
silent until you have had the chance to talk to an attorney, and then
you sign the card.
