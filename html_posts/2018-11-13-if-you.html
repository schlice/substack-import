**If your flying an F-18 and your plane alerts you that a Surface to air
missle \[sic\] has been launched at you what is the first thing you do
and how would you remain calm and not panic?**

This is a valid question, and it goes to the type and the quality of the
training you received.

In training, we were placed into situations which induced great stress.
This was done repeatedly and regularly throughout training. This is
designed to *numb* you to the stress. Eventually, you start *thinking*
through the stress. You can ignore the stress, and you can continue to
think, and act. I can remember the point at which I recognized that the
stress no longer affected me, and I was able to think through it. It's
an out-of-body sort of experience.

Then, when your C&W (caution and warning) panel is lit up like a
Christmas tree, you don't panic. You think through the stress, and you
continue to do the primary job: *flying the plane*. And, if you can, you
get your plane home safely. And, if you can, you complete your mission.

Or, as in this question, when your
[[MAW](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f9fc53&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_approach_warning_system){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} starts to yell at you,
you don't panic. You follow your training, and you employ the
appropriate countermeasures.
