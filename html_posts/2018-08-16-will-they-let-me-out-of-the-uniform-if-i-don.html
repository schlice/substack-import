**Will they let me out of the uniform if I don\'t like the U.S. Army's
basic training?**

There are a lot of answers here, and most of them are wrong.

You most certainly can be discharged from the military during the first
180 days of your military service. It's called an *Entry Level
Separation*. It is given to people who are in "entry level status,"
which generally means within the first 180 days of military training.

The [[GI Rights

way:

> The military has its own way of life, with its own standards of
> conduct, unique customs and traditions, and different pressures and
> expectations. As a new recruit, you must learn to think differently

An ELS carries no characterization with it (i.e. it's not an honorable
or dishonorable discharge). Your status will be as if you never enlisted
in the first place. You will also not be considered a military veteran.

This sort of separation says, "You had the best intentions in mind, but
not everyone is a good fit for military service, and some people only
learn this once they get there."
