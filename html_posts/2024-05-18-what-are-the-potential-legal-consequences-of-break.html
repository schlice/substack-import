The only actions an HOA can take will be listed in the Governing
Documents of that HOA. While all HOAs are different, they do share some
similarities in terms of how they address violations.

If you violate a rule established by the HOA in the Governing Documents
(the Covenants, the Bylaws, or the Rules and Regulations), you will be
notified. Normally, you will be sent a courtesy notice advising you of
the rule violation and giving you a timeframe to fix it. If you fail to
fix it within the timeframe they've given you, they may levy a *fine*
against you. A fine is simply an amount that is billed to you in the
same way that your HOA dues are billed. In most cases, before fines are
levied, the HOA will give you an opportunity to address the Board of
Directors at one of their meetings before you are fined. The specifics
about how many courtesy letters and meetings you will see in your
neighborhood are all in your Governing Documents.

You will continue to be fined until you fix the issue.

\

The *legal* consequences come if you don't pay your fines. They're the
same consequences if you don't pay your dues. If your account goes
unpaid for long enough (fines plus late fees), a *lien* will be placed
on your home, since the HOA has a controlling interest in the land on
which your home is built. You won't be able to sell your home or
refinance it without repaying the lien.

And if your lien goes unpaid for long enough, the HOA will *foreclose*
on your lien, selling your house out from under you to reimburse what
you owe.

As a Board member in two different HOAs in two different states, I have
seen only two instances where we have had to place liens on a house. In
one instance, the homeowner was actually trying (eventually) to work
with us, but it was only the lien that made him sit up and take notice.
After we attached the lien to his house, he finally started
communicating with us and we worked out a payment plan for everything he
owed (which was about twice the original amount when you add in late
fees and lawyer costs). In the other, the homeowner was a real jerk and
simply refused to work with us. The day we were going to file
foreclosure on his lien, his bank foreclosed on the house (he wasn't
paying them either), and as the second lienholder behind his bank, we
still got paid. Two weeks later, he was arrested on an unrelated
domestic violence charge. Real winner, that one. Wanna know the worst
part? He was a well-known lawyer in town. Nice.

\

In most cases with most HOAs, the Board will do everything in its power
to work with you to resolve the issue. The only time problems happen is
when you don't work with them. Ignore their letters and meeting requests
and you'll end up with fines and possible liens on your property.
