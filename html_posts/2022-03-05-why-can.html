It's very simple.

**Banning guns means automatic rule by the strong, the young, and the
many.**

Fights, even ones where martial arts are involved, are won by the
stronger party inflicting massive damage on the weaker party.

Or, by the younger opponent outlasting the older opponent.

Or, if it's three against one, the three win every time. It's not even a
contest. Doesn't matter how well trained the one is. One person whipping
a roomful of thugs? Only in the movies. No martial artist can dig
himself out of 2000 pounds of humans laying on top of him. "Hey, I've
got a great idea! Let's take our numerical advantage and *throw it out
the window* by attacking this guy one at a time!" said no one ever,
except in the movies.

Fights where two guys pummel the hell out of each other and they both
walk away with no worse than a bloody lip and maybe a black eye is the
stuff of movies and TV. Reality is much, much worse.

Guns level the playing field. Guns put the octogenarian on the same
level as the twentysomething mugger with a knife. Guns put the average
Joe on par with the 300-pound bruiser. And guns give the single gay guy
a fighting chance against a carload of drunk frat boys with baseball
bats.

Guns are the *great equalizer*. Guns are equally as effective in the
hands of the powerlifter or the martial artist as they are in the hands
of the octogenarian. In order to provide that level of equality, guns
must be both lethal and easy to use.

It's said that "God made man, but Sam Colt made them equal." Guns level
the playing field.

Original question:

Why can\'t gun owners just learn martial arts instead of buying
dangerous weapons?
