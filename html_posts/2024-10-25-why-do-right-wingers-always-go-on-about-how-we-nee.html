The answer is simple, but the details are where everyone gets lost.

When we boil down the pro-life and the pro-choice movements, they have
one very specific issue at their core:

- The pro-life movement believes that all human life has equal value,
  regardless of its age or location.
- The pro-choice movement places differential value on human life based
  on its age or location.

That's it. That's the core of both positions.

So understanding the core issue, let's apply it to your statement that
"sperm or egg alone is a potential life, or is life". There is a
scientific definition of life, and there is also a scientific definition
of what constitutes "human life."

Sure, a sperm and an egg constitute "potential human life," but does it
deserve the same level of protection of its existence as a living human
being?

The answer is **no**. Since sperm by itself does not qualify as a living
human being, and eggs by themselves do not qualify as a living human
being, they are not afforded the same right to life as a living human
being.

So when is something classified as a living human being? When it is
alive and human. We know that the zygote is human because it has two
human parents and it is a unique living organism, replicating and
producing human proteins. We know it is alive because it is growing and
consuming energy.

So, just to clarify:

- Sperm: Not Human.
- Egg: Not Human
- Zygote/Embryo/Fetus/Baby: Human and alive.

crazy and start screaming about how I just want to control women and
turn them into baby factories or whatever, I'll politely delete your

In other words, **discussion is welcome.** ***Ad hominem*** **attacks
are not.**
