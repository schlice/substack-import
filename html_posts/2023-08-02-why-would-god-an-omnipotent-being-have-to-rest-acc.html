This is an excellent question. Most of the confusion stems from the
translation between Hebrew and English.

The word translated as "rest" in Hebrew has a variety of meanings. In
fact, one of the main definitions of the Hebrew word *shabat* is "to
cease or stop." In Genesis 2:2 the understanding is that God "stopped"
His work; He "ceased" creating on the seventh day. All that He had
created was good, and His work was finished.

So the definition of the word "rest" doesn't mean that He was tired and
He had to take a break. It signifies that He "stopped" creating. It was
an intentional cessation of creation activity. Everything He wanted to
create had been made. He looked at His creation, declared it "good"
(Genesis 1:31), and He stopped. In the Jewish tradition, the concept of
*shabat* has been carried over as the "Sabbath." The Law of Moses taught
there was to be no work at all on the seventh day (Saturday). Because
God ceased from work that day, the Israelites were to cease from their
work that day as well. The days of creation are the basis of our
universal observance of a seven-day week.

TL;DR: God's "rest" was not because He was tired, but because He was
completely finished with His work.
