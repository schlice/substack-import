*This is a tretasie I have had on my computer for a long time; I don\'t
remember the source, but I\'ve found various incarnations of it all over
the Internet. If you have a source you\'d like to share, by all means
let me know so that I can provide the proper attribution.*

*Also, I don\'t expect to convert any atheists here; indeed, atheism
rejects all of this on its face, so you probaby find all of this amusing
and slightly boring. That\'s okay. I don\'t want to convert anyone. I
just want you to understand. If you at least understand, but still
don\'t believe, I have accomplished something today.*

The question of whether there is a conclusive argument for the existence
of God has been debated down through history, with exceedingly
intelligent people taking both sides of the dispute. In recent times,
arguments against the possibility of God's existence have taken on a
militant spirit that accuses anyone daring to believe in God as being
delusional and irrational. Karl Marx asserted that anyone believing in
God must have a mental disorder that caused invalid thinking. The
psychiatrist Sigmund Freud wrote that a person who believed in a Creator
God was delusional and only held their beliefs due to a \"wish
fulfillment\" factor that produced what Freud considered to be their
unjustifiable position. The philosopher Frederick Nietzsche bluntly said
that faith equates to not wanting to know what is true. The voices of
these three figures from history (along with others) are simply now
parroted by a new generation of atheists who claim that a belief in God
is intellectually unwarranted.

Is this truly the case? Is belief in God a rationally unacceptable
position to hold? Is there a logical and reasonable argument for the
existence of God? Outside of referencing the Bible, can a case for the
existence of God be made that refutes the positions of both the old and
new atheists and gives sufficient warrant for believing in a Creator?
The answer is yes it can. Moreover, in demonstrating the validity of an
argument for the existence of God, the case for atheism is shown to be
intellectually weak.

To make an argument for the existence of God, we must start by asking
the right questions. And where to begin is with the most basic
metaphysical question: "Why do we have something rather than nothing at
all?" This is the basic question of existence---why are we here; why is
the earth here; why is the universe here rather than nothing? Commenting
on this point, one theologian has said, "In one sense man does not ask
the question about God, his very existence raises the question about
God."

In considering this question, there are four possible answers to why we
have something rather than nothing at all:

1\. Reality is an illusion.\
2. Reality is/was self-created.\
3. Reality is self-existent (eternal).\
4. Reality was created by something that is self-existent.

So, which is the most plausible solution? Let's begin with reality being
simply an illusion, which is what a number of eastern religions believe.
This option was ruled out centuries ago by the philosopher Rene
Descartes who is famous for the statement, "I think, therefore I am."
Descartes, a mathematician, argued that if he is thinking then he must
'be.' In other words, "I think, therefore I am not an illusion."
Illusions require something experiencing the illusion, and moreover, you
cannot doubt the existence of yourself without proving your existence;
it is a self-defeating argument. So the possibility of reality being an
illusion is eliminated.

Next is the option of reality being self-created. When you study
philosophy, you learn that there are things called \"analytically
false\" statements, which means they are false by definition. The
possibility of reality being self-created is one of those types of
statements for the simple reason that something cannot be prior to
itself. If you created yourself, then you must have existed prior to you
creating yourself, but that simply cannot be. In evolution this is
sometimes referred to as 'spontaneous generation'---something coming
from nothing---a position that few, if any, reasonable people hold to
anymore simply because you cannot get something from nothing. Even the
atheist David Hume said, "I never asserted so absurd a proposition as
that anything might arise without a cause." This being the case, the
alternative of reality being self-created is ruled out.

Now we are left with only two choices---an eternal reality or reality
being created by something that is eternal: an eternal universe or an
eternal Creator. The 18th century theologian Jonathan Edwards summed up
the crossroads we have now come to this way:

• Something exists.\
• Nothing cannot create something.\
• Therefore, a necessary and eternal 'something' exists.

Notice that you must go back to an eternal 'something.' The atheist who
derides the believer in God for believing in an eternal Creator must
turn around and embrace an eternal universe; it is the only other door
they can choose. But the question now is: where does the evidence lead?
Does the evidence point to matter before mind or mind before matter?

To date, all key scientific and philosophical evidence points away from
an eternal universe and toward an eternal Creator. From a scientific
standpoint, honest scientists admit the universe had a beginning, and
whatever has a beginning is not eternal. In other words, whatever has a
beginning has a cause, and if the universe had a beginning, it had a
cause. The fact that the universe had a beginning is underscored by
evidence such as the second law of thermodynamics, the radiation echo of
the big bang discovered in the early 1900's, the fact that the universe
is expanding and can be traced back to a singular beginning, and
Einstein's theory of relativity. All prove the universe is not eternal.

Further, the laws that surround causation speak against the universe
being the ultimate cause of all we know for this simple fact: an effect
must resemble its cause. This being true, no atheist can explain how an
impersonal, purposeless, meaningless, and amoral universe accidentally
created beings (us) who are full of personality and obsessed with
purpose, meaning, and morals. Such a thing, from a causation standpoint,
completely refutes the idea of a natural universe birthing everything
that exists. So in the end, the concept of an eternal universe is
eliminated.

Philosopher J. S. Mill (not a Christian) summed up where we have now
come to this way: "It is self-evident that only Mind can create mind."
The only rational and reasonable conclusion is that an eternal Creator
is the one who is responsible for reality as we know it. Or to put it in
a logical set of statements:

• We exist (we are not an illusion); we are \"something\".\
• You do not get something from nothing.\
• Therefore a necessary and eternal 'something' exists.\
• The only two options are an eternal universe and an eternal Creator.\
• Science and philosophy have disproven the concept of an eternal
universe.\
• Therefore, an eternal Creator exists

Former atheist Lee Strobel, who arrived at this end result many years
ago, said "Essentially, I realized that to stay an atheist, I would have
to believe that nothing produces everything; non-life produces life;
randomness produces fine-tuning; chaos produces information;
unconsciousness produces consciousness; and non-reason produces reason.
Those leaps of faith were simply too big for me to take, especially in
light of the affirmative case for God\'s existence ... In other words,
in my assessment the Christian worldview accounted for the totality of
the evidence much better than the atheistic worldview."

But the next question we must tackle is this: If an eternal Creator
exists (and we have shown that He does), what kind of Creator is He? Can
we infer things about Him from what He created? In other words, can we
understand the cause by its effects? The answer to this is yes, we can,
with the following characteristics being surmised:

• He must be supernatural in nature (as He created time and space).\
• He must be powerful (incredibly).\
• He must be eternal (self-existent).\
• He must be omnipresent (He created space and is not limited by it).\
• He must be timeless and changeless (He created time).\
• He must be immaterial because He transcends space/physical.\
• He must be personal (the impersonal cannot create personality).\
• He must be infinite and singular as you cannot have two infinites.\
• He must be diverse yet have unity as unity and diversity exist in
nature.\
• He must be intelligent (supremely). Only cognitive being can produce
cognitive being.\
• He must be purposeful as He deliberately created everything.\
• He must be moral (no moral law can be had without a giver).\
• He must be caring (or no moral laws would have been given).

These things being true, we now ask if any religion in the world
describes such a Creator. The answer to this is yes: the God of the
Bible fits this profile perfectly. He is supernatural (Genesis 1:1),
powerful (Jeremiah 32:17), eternal (Psalm 90:2), omnipresent (Psalm
139:7), timeless/changeless (Malachi 3:6), immaterial (John 5:24),
personal (Genesis 3:9), necessary (Colossians 1:17), infinite/singular
(Jeremiah 23:24, Deuteronomy 6:4), diverse yet with unity (Matthew
28:19), intelligent (Psalm 147:4-5), purposeful (Jeremiah 29:11), moral
(Daniel 9:14), and caring (1 Peter 5:6-7).

One last subject to address on the matter of God's existence is the
matter of how justifiable the atheist's position actually is. Since the
atheist asserts the believer's position is unsound, it is only
reasonable to turn the question around and aim it squarely back at him.
The first thing to understand is that the claim the atheist makes---'no
god' which is that 'atheist' means---is an untenable position to hold
from a philosophical standpoint. As legal scholar and philosopher
Mortimer Adler says, "An affirmative existential proposition can be
proved, but a negative existential proposition---one that denies the
existence of something---cannot be proved." For example, someone may
claim that a red eagle exists and someone else may assert that red
eagles do not exist. The former only needs to find a single red eagle to
prove his assertion. But the latter must comb the entire universe and
literally be in every place at once to ensure they have not missed a red
eagle somewhere and at some time, which is impossible to do. This is why
intellectually honest atheists will admit they cannot prove God does not
exist.

Next, it is important to understand the issue that surrounds the
seriousness of truth claims that are made and amount of evidence
required to warrant certain conclusions. For example, if someone puts
two containers of lemonade in front of you and says that one may be more
tart than the other, since the consequences of getting the more tart
drink would not be serious, you would not require a large amount of
evidence in order to make your choice. However, if to one cup the host
added sweetener but to the other he introduced rat poison, then you
would want to have quite a bit of evidence before you made your choice.

This is where a person sits when deciding between atheism and belief in
God. Since belief in atheism could possibly result in irreparable and
eternal consequences, it would seem that the atheist should be mandated
to produce weighty and overriding evidence to support their position,
but they cannot. Atheism simply cannot meet the test for evidence for
the seriousness of the charge it makes. Instead, the atheist and those
whom they convince of their position slide into eternity with their
fingers crossed and hope they do not find the unpleasant truth that
eternity does indeed exist and that such a place is an awfully long time
to be wrong. As Mortimer Adler says, "More consequences for life and
action follow from the affirmation or denial of God than from any other
basic question."

So does belief in God have intellectual warrant? Is there a rational,
logical, and reasonable argument for the existence of God? Absolutely.
While atheists such as Freud claim that those believing in God have a
wish fulfillment desire, perhaps it is Freud and his followers who
actually suffer from wish fulfillment: the hope and wish that there is
no God, no accountability, and therefore no judgment. But refuting Freud
is the God of the Bible who affirms His existence and the fact that a
judgment is indeed coming for those who know within themselves the truth
that He exists but suppress that truth (Romans 1:20). But for those who
respond to the evidence that a Creator does indeed exist, He offers the
way of salvation that has been accomplished through His Son, Jesus
Christ: \"Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his
name, he gave the right to become children of God---children born not of
natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband\'s will, but born of
God\" (John 1:12-13).
