**Why aren\'t guns banned in the US?**

Lawmakers are not allowed to ban guns in the US. The Second Amendment
prevents them from doing so. In a nutshell, it says that "the right of
the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed." This means
that lawmakers cannot pass laws making guns illegal.

That said, they can pass laws that require background checks and permits
if you want to conceal a firearm. They can restrict guns in certain
locations, like within government buildings.
