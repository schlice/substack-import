*Note: I am not condoning the actions taken by the airline. I am simply
answering the question.*

The crew *had* been asking for volunteers. They were offering \$800, a
free night in a hotel if you had to stay another day to catch the next
flight, and free meals in-between. The ticket price on that flight was
around \$250, so they were offering roughly **four times the value** of
the ticket you paid, and they weren't getting any takers.

So it's not that they didn't ask before they told people to get off the
plane. They did. They had to get a crew into Louisville, or they would
have been forced to cancel the flight out of Louisville, which would
have inconvenienced far more passengers than the four they were
displacing. They made a strategic business decision. Was it worth it? As
of right now (11 Apr 17), UAL stock is down 4.4%, representing about
\$990 million in lost revenue.

Also, under normal circumstances, passengers understand that when they
receive "crewmember instructions," they are required under Federal law
to follow those instructions. Airlines have de-planed passengers before;
most passengers tacitly comply, because they understand that you are not
"guaranteed" passage on an aircraft. Remember, they needed **four**
seats; three other passengers de-planed as directed! As soon as you
refuse to follow a crewmember's instructions, you are a "hazard" and you
*should* be removed from the plane. When the passenger chose to refuse
to get off the plane, he escalated the situation.

So let's be fair: when you are told to get off the plane, it's not a
directive you have the right to refuse. Once the passenger refused to
follow crewmember instructions, it became a law enforcement issue.
