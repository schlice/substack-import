First, we need to define a "black knight narcissist," because it is a
term coined by one of our very own Quorans, [[Elinor
Greenberg](https://www.quora.com/profile/Elinor-Greenberg)]{.qlink_container}:

> ***White Knights, Black Knights, and Victims: Three Different
> Strategies for Getting Narcissistic Supplies***
>
> *All Narcissists are preoccupied with self-esteem enhancement, but not
> all of them use strategies that hurt other people. One can think of
> three of the most common Narcissistic strategies as falling into these
> basic categories: White Knights, Black Knights, and Victims.*
>
> ***The White Knights****: These are the "do-gooders" of the Narcissist
> world. They raise their self-esteem by going around doing favors and
> good deeds for as many people as possible. When they have the funds,
> they give to charities, build hospitals, and support cultural causes.
> Their goal is to make the world a better place and, by doing so,
> internally settle once and for all their self-doubt about whether they
> are really a decent human being. By the way, although I am mostly
> using the pronoun "he," all of the Knights and Victims can be men or
> women or anything in between.*
>
> *Like all Narcissists, White Knights are very concerned with what
> others think about them and often these are some of the best-liked
> people in their neighborhood. They are the neighbors who offer to help
> you paint your house, or get you milk and orange juice when they are
> on the way to the grocery store. The more they please you, the better
> they feel about themselves. Think Knights of the Arthurian Round Table
> who have sworn an oath to protect those weaker than them and make the
> world a better place. Often White Knights hold jobs in helping
> professions and that further enhances their shaky self-esteem.*
>
> *Of course, when the wives of White Knight Narcissists come to
> therapy, their main complaint is that they hardly ever get to see
> their husband because the husbands are so busy helping everyone else
> and not doing the chores that need doing around their house. They are
> likely to spend much of their free time trying to prove their goodness
> to strangers and will often ignore their family's needs in order to do
> this.*
>
> ***Black Knights:*** *Unlike the White Knights, these people get their
> self-esteem from destroying yours. They like nothing better than to
> prove to you that they are better than you. They are sadistic bullies,
> who if they could, would grind you into the dust under their feet.
> Dominating other people is their main pleasure in life. They are a
> very different kettle of fish from the White Knights. When people
> advise you to avoid all Narcissists, they are usually thinking of
> Black Knight types, not their do-gooder White Knight cousins.*
>
> ***Victims:*** *These are the Narcissists whose main claim to fame is
> how they are always treated worse than anyone else. They will tell you
> repetitive, boring, long stories about each insult that they have
> endured. They endlessly complain about the waitress who brought them
> their food cold, the parking attendant who lost their keys, and the
> nasty bus driver who closed the door in their face. Like all
> Narcissists, they are motivated to show everyone how important and
> special they are; but in their case their specialness revolves around
> how badly they get treated and how much worse it is for them than for
> everyone else.*[\[1\]](#ccloz){#cite-ccloz .citation_link}

Multiple Sclerosis is an autoimmune disease which causes the immune
system to attack and destroy the myelin sheath which surrounds nerve
fibers in the central nervous system, in a process called
*demyelination*. MS causes varied symptoms throughout the body, but the
most common are fatigue, brain fog, numbness and tingling, vision
issues, bowel/bladder issues, sexual dysfunction, and muscle weakness.
The disease affects everyone differently; no two patients have the exact
same symptoms, although some symptoms are more common than others.

A black knight narcissist is a person who gets his self-esteem by
destroying yours. When they develop MS, they develop a disease which
causes physical symptoms, some of which may make one feel weak or
helpless. This is definitely not good for the black knight narcissist,
as it removes some of the tools they use to destroy the self-esteem of
others. How can I destroy your self-esteem regarding your physique when
my own is deteriorating? It's hypocritical. This kind of divergent
thinking alone can cause more psychological issues, so the narcissist
will have to either ignore it, hide it, or adapt to it.

Dr. Greenberg would know the answer to this next part better than I, but
it might be possible for a black knight narcissist to "re-tool" himself
into a victim narcissist, and use the disease as his nemesis. I am
unaware of how effectively the black knight narcissist would be able to
make this transformation, but I hypothesize that it is possible.
