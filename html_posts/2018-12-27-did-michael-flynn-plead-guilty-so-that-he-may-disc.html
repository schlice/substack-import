**Did Michael Flynn plead guilty so that he may disclose secrets of
wrongdoing that he cannot disclose due to NDA and State secrets
privilege?**

No.

Non-disclosure agreements are considered to be unenforceable if they
conceal criminal activity. Therefore, even if criminal activity was
covered under an NDA, it would not be unlawful to discuss it, as the NDA
would not apply. Flynn plead guilty to lying to the FBI, not to
committing any other crimes. The guilty plea does not remove any valid
non-disclosure agreements that may be in place. If he violates any such
agreements, he is still liable for whatever penalties were specified in
those agreements (unless, as I said, the agreement was designed to
prevent the disclosure of criminal acts). Remember: NDAs impose civil
penalties, not criminal ones.

In fact, the standard boilerplate of most NDAs includes language that
exempts the agreement for disclosures required by law.

To that end, if an NDA is attempting to prevent you from disclosing
information about criminal activity, the NDA doesn't apply.

State secrets probably doesn't apply, since this is more related to
things like human intelligence operations which require secrecy, or the
inability to publish certain classified information, or the use of
classified information in criminal cases. It's unlikely that Flynn was
involved in classified dealings while part of the *campaign*. He was
more likely to be involved with classified material while part of the
*transition team*, after the election. Flynn's investigation was about
his time *before* the election.
