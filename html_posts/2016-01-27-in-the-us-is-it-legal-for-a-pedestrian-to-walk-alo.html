In most jurisdictions, the \"side of the road\" is not technically the
road. It is called the \"shoulder.\" Legally, bicycles and other
unlicensed vehicles (i.e. ATV\'s) cannot use the sidewalk, as it is
exclusively reserved for pedestrians. Those vehicles must use the
shoulder, as far off the road as is practical. Sometimes the shoulder is
marked with a solid white line,

sometimes it is not.

Sometimes the shoulder is wide enough to fit a whole vehicle (in the
case of a disabled vehicle), sometimes it is barely wide enough to fit a
bicycle and rider.

When the sidewalk is impassable, but the shoulder is available (or if
there is no sidewalk), pedestrians can use the shoulder along with
bicyclists, assuming it is safe to do so.
