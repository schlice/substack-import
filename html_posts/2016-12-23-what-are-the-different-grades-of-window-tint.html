Automobile glass tinting reduces Visible Light Transmission (VLT)
through the glass. It is expressed as a percentage of light allowed to
pass through the glass.

In the US, each state has its own regulations regarding minimum VLTs for
vehicles registered in that state. Check your state's laws regarding
window tinting before you purchase any for your vehicle.
