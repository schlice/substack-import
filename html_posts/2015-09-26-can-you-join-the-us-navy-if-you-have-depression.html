**Content:** [The answers given here are very good. Along with those
answers, I would suggest, as a general rule, don\'t hide things from
your recruiter that you think might hurt your chances to get in to the
military. This is more common than you may think.\
\
Look, nobody\'s perfect. Everyone has something that they have to deal
with. It\'s the perfect ones that I\'d have to take a second look at, to
be honest. Your recruiter is a *recruiter* not a *non-recruiter*. He
actually wants you to join the military, conditions and all. Most
conditions are *waiverable* depending on the severity and whether or not
you have successfully treated the condition.\
\
Bottom line: tell your recruiter. Let them help you. If it\'s a
waiverable condition, let them help you collect the evidence you need to
get the waiver.]{.rendered_qtext}
