**Content:** [I\'m really torn, because even the biggest guys (MMA and
military training) can get knocked down by OC. The military doesn\'t
teach you how to fight through the pain of OC spray. The spray will
cause swelling of mucous membranes and distinct physical symptoms (like
pain\--and lots of it) that will bring big bad boys to their knees and
keep them there.\

Take a look not only at the recommendations, but at the video. Adam is
no small fry, and he cries like a baby for \~20 minutes from being
sprayed.\

OC spray is extremely effective on almost anyone. It\'s really only
somewhat ineffective on people high on certain drugs which mask pain. In
such an instance, you might think about having a Taser handy. Yes, in
most states, the Taser is legal for civilians to carry, concealed,
without a permit. Check your local laws before you throw down a few
hundred on one of these, but if it\'s good enough for the cops, it\'s
certainly good enough for you.\
