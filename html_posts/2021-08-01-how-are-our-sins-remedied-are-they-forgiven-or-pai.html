Our sins have both been forgiven, and paid for. It is through the *grace
of God* that our sins have been forgiven, and it is through the *blood
of Christ* and his sacrifice on the cross that our sin debt has been
paid.

Christ stands there, in front of you, holding out a gift in his
outstretched arms. It is the gift of eternal life. It was through the
grace of God that Jesus was given the opportunity to pay for your sins,
because God is love. And it was through Christ's sacrifice that the debt
of your sin has been paid for. And this gift is freely available to you,
through God's grace.

And all you have to do is reach out and accept it.
