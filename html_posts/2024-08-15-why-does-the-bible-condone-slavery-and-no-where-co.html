The Bible was never intended to be a political manifesto. There are
plenty of other human rights violations that the Bible also does not
condemn, but that wasn't the purpose of the Bible.

The other thing to consider is that Americans tend to look at slavery in
the past, because we successfully freed the black slaves in the American
South. **But slavery still exists today, in the United States and around
the world.** It's estimated that over 27 million people in the world are
victims of slavery today: forced labor, sex trade, inheritable property,
etc.

So why does the Bible not speak out strongly against slavery? Why does
the Bible, in fact, seem to support the practice of human slavery?

The Bible never demanded that every slave owner immediately emancipate
their slaves. Instead, the apostles gave instructions to slave owners to
act in godly ways *within the existing social system.*

> Masters, do the same to them \[treat them with goodwill\], and stop
> your threatening, knowing that he who is both their Master and yours
> is in heaven, and that there is no partiality with him. \-- Ephesians
> 6:9 ESV
>
> Masters, treat your bondservants justly and fairly, knowing that you
> also have a Master in heaven. \-- Colossians 4:1 ESV

So why didn't the Bible writers immediately command slave owners to
emancipate their slaves?

***They didn't need to.***

God's Word affects people *individually*. Those changed people, in turn,
go on to change the lives of their families, their communities, and
eventually, their nations. Christianity is not a political movement, but
over time, it naturally affects political policy. In countries where
Christianity spread, the abolition of slavery was often influenced by
the actions of converted individuals.

The Bible does contain the foundations of what people need to end
slavery: the truth that all men are created by God and made in His image
(Genesis 1:27), condemnation towards those who kidnap and sell a person
(Exodus 21:16; cf. 1 Timothy 1:8--10), and that a slave can truly be "a
brother in the Lord" (Philemon 1:16). Born-again Christians used these
truths to influence their communities and eventually bring slavery to an
end.

But evil still exists, and so the slave trade is alive and well, despite
the efforts of Christians worldwide. The fight is not over until He
destroys evil once and for all.
