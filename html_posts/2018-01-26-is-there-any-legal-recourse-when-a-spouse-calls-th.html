**Is there any legal recourse when a spouse calls their work place
multiple times and gets them fired?**

The only way something could be done is if the spouse lied about
something, and it was that lie that cost you your job. This is called
slander.

Remember though, it must have been a lie, and the lie is what needs to
have cost you your job. The truth is always a defense against slander.
And you are only able to recover damages from the spouse, you can't get
your job back.

In concert with the slander lawsuit (if you actually plan on suing your
spouse), I would also follow [[Gareth
Greetham](https://www.quora.com/profile/Gareth-Greetham)]{.qlink_container}'s
advice and get a divorce. If you don't, it's really difficult to sue
your spouse when you are married, as his finances are your finances. So
it's like you're suing yourself.

So get the divorce first, then sue for slander.
