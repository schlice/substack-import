**Why do people get legally married? Why not just have a public ceremony
and avoid the marriage license?**

**Recognition by the state.** When you are not legally married, you are
considered to be "domestic partners" as far as the state is concerned.
When you are legally married, there are some advantages that come with
that status. Here are a few things you may not have thought of:

> **You'll qualify for an estate tax marital deduction.** When one
> spouse dies, his or her estate passes to the surviving spouse,
> tax-free. That's not true for domestic partners, and even though the
> federal exemption is fairly high---currently \$5.34 million---the
> exemption in some states is low enough to catch even moderate estates.
>
> **You'll qualify for the gift tax marital deduction**. As long as your
> spouse is a U.S. citizen, you can make tax-free gifts of any amount to
> him or her. "Unmarried couples may be surprised to find out that they
> owe gift taxes as a result of making gifts or supporting each other,"
> says Paul Jacobs, a financial planner and chief investment officer of
> Palisades Hudson Financial Group in Atlanta. "The maximum annual
> tax-free gift that you can give someone is currently \$14,000."
>
> **You can roll over a deceased spouse's IRA to the surviving spouse's
> IRA**. If your significant other dies with an IRA and you aren't
> married, you'll have to start taking distributions immediately,
> regardless of your age. "A surviving spouse has the option to roll
> over the IRA into his or her own IRA, which makes it possible for a
> younger surviving spouse to postpone minimum distributions until age
> 70 and a half," says Susan Green, an associate financial advisor at
> Wescott Financial Advisory Group in Philadelphia.
>
> **You can contribute to a spousal IRA**. If you are domestic partners
> and you don't work, you can't contribute to an IRA for retirement
> savings, since you have no earned income. However, "if you're married
> and you have a working spouse and a non-working spouse, the
> non-working spouse can use the working spouse's income to qualify for
> IRA contributions," says \[Allen Falke, a business, trust and estate
> attorney with Mirick O'Connell in Worcester, MA\].
>
> **You can receive survivor's benefits from a pension plan**. If your
> spouse is lucky enough to have a pension, and they've elected to have
> survivor's benefits, you will continue receiving pension benefits
> after he or she dies. "The benefits are the biggest thing," says Ted
> Toal, a financial planner with Rockwood Wealth Management in
> Annapolis. "Especially for those who are older."
>
> **You can receive Social Security benefits.** "Spouses have the option
> of filing for a spousal benefit, which gives them the potential to
> collect up to 50% of the other spouse's benefit amount," says Michael
> Lynch, vice president of strategic markets for Hartford Funds in
> Radnor, PA. There is also the possibility for a larger benefit upon
> the death of a spouse, he says. Imagine, for instance, that you are
> collecting \$1,000 a month in Social Security benefits and your spouse
> is collecting \$1,200 a month. If your spouse dies, you could start
> collecting survivor benefits of \$1,200---a \$200-per-month increase.
> As a domestic partner, you have no such option.
>
> **You'll save on health insurance**. "Usually plans for one plus a
> spouse are cheaper than if you each have your own plan, even if it's
> an employer sponsored plan," Toal says. This is especially helpful if
> one of you doesn't have access to insurance through your employer---if
> you're self-employed, for instance.
>
> **You have an advantage if your spouse is incapacitated**. If your
> significant other is in a car crash, you may have more difficulty
> seeing him or her at a hospital if you aren't a blood relation or a
> legal spouse. And if a judge has to name someone to make healthcare or
> financial decisions on behalf of your partner, you may be overlooked
> in favor of a parent or sibling if you aren't married. "What if the
> parents of the other person don't like the significant other?" Toal
> says. "They will be in court battling for control of everything."
>
> **You have more protection if your spouse dies.** "If one passes away
> without a will, the state is going to dictate where your assets go,"
> Toal says. If your significant other still has parents and siblings in
> the equation when that happens, they may receive assets over a
> nonrelated boyfriend or girlfriend.[\[1\]](#qXjLQ){#cite-qXjLQ
