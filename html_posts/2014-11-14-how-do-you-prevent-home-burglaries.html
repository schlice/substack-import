**Content:** [Use the \"Redneck Home Security System.\"\
\
]{.rendered_qtext}

1.  Get a big dog bowl. Put (or have your neighbor\'s dog put) some
    menacing-looking bite marks on it. Put it by your front door.\
2.  Get a big dog toy. Drive over it with you car several times or have
    the neighbor\'s dog do a number on it as well. Leave it near the dog
    bowl.
3.  (Bonus points here) Sprinkle a few spent shotgun shells around the
    bowl.
4.  Leave a note on your front door that reads: \"Hey Bubba, Big Jim,
    Duke and Slim, I went to the gun shop for more ammunition. Back in
    an hour. Don\'t mess with the pit bulls \-- they attacked the
    mailman this morning and messed him up real bad. I don\'t think
    Killer took part in it but it was hard to tell from all the blood.
    PS - I locked all four of \'em in the house. Better wait outside.\"
5.  DONE!
