**Is a Last Will & Testament legal if you do it yourself, does it need
to be notarized, do we need to file it before or after death, where do
we take it to have it filed & on record?**

Whoa chief, lots of questions here. And most of the answers will depend
on where you lived and where you died.

The rub with wills is proving your will was written by you, before you
died.

If you don't have it notarized or witnessed, your successors will have a
harder time proving in court that you wrote it, or that it was actually
written before you died, meaning that your will will be much more easily
*contested.*
