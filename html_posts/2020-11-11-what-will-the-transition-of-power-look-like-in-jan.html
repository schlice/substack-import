**What if Donald Trump doesn\'t concede by January 20, 2021?**

There is no requirement in the Constitution for the President to
"concede." There is nothing requiring him to give a concession speech.
There's also nothing requiring him to participate in the ceremonies
regarding transition of power. If the election was certified and Biden
was declared to be the candidate who achieved 270 electoral votes, then
Trump's transition team will be moving him out of the White House
whether he wants it or not. Most likely, they will relocate his stuff to
his new home of residence in Florida. He doesn't own the White House;
the people do. He's only a temporary resident there. He's well aware of
this.

The Constitution provides the entire process for transition. There's no
real conceivable way that Trump could stay in the White House beyond
January 20th if he is not certified to be the winner.
