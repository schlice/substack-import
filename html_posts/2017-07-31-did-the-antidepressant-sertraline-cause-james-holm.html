In my humble opinion, the foundational issues to Holmes' psychotic
behavior were the *two* drugs he was on: Zoloft and Klonopin (sertraline
is the generic version of Zoloft).

Holmes was on Zoloft, which has a *black box warning* stating that it
can increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Other side
effects of Zoloft can include, but are not limited to, agitation,
irritability, anxiety, hostility, aggressiveness, hallucinations, mania,
impulsivity, delusions and apathy.

He was also on Klonopin. Klonopin is a benzodiazepine. This means it is
essentially a tranquilizer. It is a *short-term* medication (no more
than a week) used to control epilepsy or some anxiety disorders. It is
not meant for long-term use. It's a hallucinogen, and the potential side
effects of Klonopen are almost identical to the potential side effects
of Zoloft. It's unknown just how long Holmes was taking Klonopin

Holmes was also abusing alcohol at the same time. Alcohol increases the
side effects of these drugs

So you have two drugs whose side effects would magnify each other, along
with alcohol. This is a potentially toxic and deadly combination. I
believe that it was these drugs that were the foundation that led a
promising neurologist down the road of schizophrenia, psychosis, and
disinhibition, eventually leading him to premeditated murder.
