**Content:** [DC will never become a state. Period.\
\
Puerto Rico will become a state once we get a majority in Congress
(Democrat) and the White House that will support it. I don\'t see it
happening before 2025.\
\
Nevertheless, Puerto Rico has finally agreed to petition the United
States for statehood. It was only just a few years ago that they
requested statehood.\
\
But they might want to think again. According to [[a new GAO
report](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4ada07&url=http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-14-31){.external_link

for Puerto Rico\'s economy:\

Statehood would mean that every day Puerto Ricans would be saddled with
\$2.3 billion in new federal taxes that they do not pay today. This
would essentially cut in half the revenue the territory currently
receives, which would be disastrous for the island\'s economy.
