No, because "Stand your Ground" is only applicable if you are following
the law yourself.

I'll assume you're talking about Florida's law, since that's the most
recent, and the most frequently mischaracterized.

Florida's law creates **civil immunity** for people who drive out of
crowds of protesters in roadways, meaning they won't be sued for damages
if people get hurt or killed if they claim self-defense.

This doesn't mean there won't be a criminal investigation. The police
and the District Attorney will still investigate. If they find that the
driver deliberately drove over people in a roadway, and that the driver
was not being attacked but did the attacking, criminal charges will
still follow, **and that driver can later be sued for negligence or
wrongful death**.

But if someone was genuinely in fear for their life because protesters
swarmed their car and started attacking them, leaving the scene by
driving away won't result in a civil suit if any of the protesters,
**who themselves were violating the law,** get hurt or killed. If there
are no charges because the driver claimed self-defense, under the
state's new law, the driver can't later be sued over that incident.

That's all the law says. The criminal process will continue, but
motorists who were in fear for their lives no longer have to fear being
sued for injuring protesters.

Original question:

If a State passes a law allowing Drivers to run over Protesters, can
Protesters use a State's "Stand-Your-Ground" law to protect themselves?
