**Content:** [First of all, you can\'t \"make\" someone fall in love
with you, Godly or otherwise. It will happen when it happens and not a
second sooner.\
\
In order to find the person you\'re looking for, make sure you\'re
looking in the place you want to find the person you\'re looking for.\
\
You may be pretty active in the church, but are you active in the place
where single men are expecting to find single women? Are you active in
the singles groups in your church? I attend a Christian church, and we
have singles groups that do monthly social functions.\
\
What about your friends? I assume they are churchgoers as well; do they
go to other social functions with similarly-churched people? Have you
tried attending any of those functions?\
\
And finally, to add a more Christian bent to my answer, have you asked
God about this? God will bring the right person into your life when He
is ready to do so. Telling God that you want Him to bring you someone
*right now* is the height of arrogance. Who are we to place demands on
God? When God is ready, He will place the right man in your life.
Because the timetable is not up to us, is it?]{.rendered_qtext}
