Separation of church and state. The state cannot impose a law on a
church which would violate church rules or beliefs.

Priests are bound by \"the sacramental seal.\" This is also called \"the
seal of the confessional\" or \"the seal of confession.\" From [[the
Catholic Education
Center](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5e2f23&url=http://catholiceducation.org){.external_link

> The sacramental seal is inviolable. Quoting Canon 983.1 of the Code of

Since the state cannot make a law compelling a priest to violate the
teachings of his religion, a priest cannot be compelled to divulge
anything he heard in confession, regardless of the benefit of the
outcome of such a reporting. Such a law would be in violation of the
First Amendment freedom of religion (\"Congress shall make no law
respecting an establishment of religion, or **prohibiting the free
exercise thereof**\"). This has been interpreted to mean that Congress
cannot legislate the practices of any individual religion, or religion
as a whole. The Catholic Church holds the seal of confession inviolable;
therefore, the state cannot create a law mandating that the church
violate that seal.

On the other hand, psychiatrists and other medical professionals are
bound by **doctor-patient privilege**, which is a *state* construct, not
a *religious* one. Inherent in doctor-patient privilege is the notion
that a doctor must report someone who is a danger to himself or others
to proper law enforcement personnel. This is part of the rules of
doctor-patient privilege: under most circumstances, a doctor cannot
reveal anything about your personal health to anyone you do not specify.
You can specify persons to whom a doctor is allowed to discuss your
personal health information (e.g. your spouse); you cannot similarly
give a priest the authorization to break the seal of confession.
