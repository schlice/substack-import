**Why does Congress debate during the impeachment of Trump? Is it not
like any side would budge?**

You are correct. But Congress takes the opportunity to debate to try and
influence **you**, the voting public.

In fact, this entire impeachment sham is solely for **your** benefit, to
try to change your vote in November, 2020. That's all this is: a
televised, fully-government-funded, campaign ad on how bad of an Orange
Man Trump is, to try to get you to change your vote.

The writing's on the wall. It's easy to see why this is all happening,
if you take the time to look at it objectively.
