**Content:** [An attempted crime requires the *mens rea,* or the
criminal mind, meaning you have to have some sort of plan to commit a
crime. But you then need to take a *substantial step* towards the *actus
reus* (or the.criminal act) of that crime. You need to drive to the
location of the crime at the time you planned, or something like that.
SWATting is not a substantial step towards you committing a murder. Even
SWATting someone hoping the police will kill them doesn\'t rise to the
level of attempted murder.]{.rendered_qtext}
