**Content:** []{.rendered_qtext}

Really? A lawyer fabricating evidence isn\'t life-altering to the
defendant? A judge on a mission to rid the world of drug dealers isn\'t
life-altering to that defendant? And what\'s to say that convenience
store clerk isn\'t carrying a legal concealed weapon?

The difference is that the cop has the gun as part of the tools he is
required to carry for his job. But in this country, anyone can carry
life-altering power in their waistband (except for felons and the
mentally ill).
