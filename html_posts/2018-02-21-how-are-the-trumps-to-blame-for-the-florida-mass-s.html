**How are the Trumps to blame for the Florida mass shooting on February
15th, 2018?**

Because one of the Trumps went down to that school and held the door
open so the shooter could go in.

That would be the only way that any of the Trumps could be "to blame"
for the shootings.

Perhaps people believe that Trump should have "done something" and
perhaps people feel that Trump "didn't do enough" to help.

Perhaps people feel that Trump should write an Executive Order banning
all guns (which as any common-sense person knows, would make all guns
magically disappear). Maybe that's why he's "to blame."

Perhaps he "should have known" that the [[FBI is more messed up than we
all originally

I don't know, exactly.

But if we're going to assign blame, make sure you blame the right
person. **Nikolas Cruz.** He is the only person to blame for the
shooting.

There are others who may have missed the signs that this happened, but
make sure you put the blame squarely where it belongs.
