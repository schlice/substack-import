title: '"Why do people hit the brakes if you are tailgating them? They should either
  speed up or drive the same speed until the tailgater is able to safely pass. Driving
  slow is bad but hitting the brakes and slowing down even more is even worse."'

When you tailgate, you limit your own reaction time to the car in front
of you. Consequently, the car in front of you cannot slow down quickly,
or you'll run into them.

To combat this, the car in front of you must follow the car in front of
*him* at a greater distance, so that the car in front of you has more
time to decelerate more gradually, so that you have more opportunity to
stop before you hit him. If the car in front of you has to hit his
brakes hard, you'll end up in his lap, and no one wants that.

So you tailgating forces the driver in front of you to slow down to give
him more reaction time to slow down more gradually so you don't hit him.

Or he's just trying to brake-check you as a method to send a clear
message: *get off my ass.*
