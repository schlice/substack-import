So first, let's clarify a few things.

Oklahoma, as with most states in the US, has a strong "castle doctrine."
This moniker comes from the phrase, "a man's home is his castle." The
state legislature recognizes that Oklahomans have an absolute right to
feel safe within the confines of their home. To that end, **they have
the right to use force, up to and including deadly force, to defend
themselves within that home, from unauthorized entrants wishing to do
harm.**

In states with strong castle doctrines:

- don't enter a home unauthorized
  - and don't do so armed
  - and don't do so while threatening the occupants.

Doing so may evoke an accurate, high-velocity response.

Let's clarify another misconception you have about the US. **The police
do not exist to protect you from crime.** The police exist to bring
criminals to justice, not to defend citizens from crime. Numerous
Supreme Court decisions have been handed down which clarify and cement
this fact.

So with that in mind, let's review:

- Three armed assailants enter a home in Oklahoma.
- The homeowner shoots and kills them.

This is consistent with Oklahoma law. No reason for the homeowner to
have waited for police response before taking action to defend himself
and others in the home.

Remember, *when seconds count, the police are only minutes away.*
