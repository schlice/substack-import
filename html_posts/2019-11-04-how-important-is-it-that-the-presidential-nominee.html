**How important is it that the Presidential nominee is immune to
criticism by having as much intersectionality as possible from which to
draw an artificial shield of innocence?**

No one should be immune to criticism. The 1st Amendment ensures that. Of
course, you can only criticize until you begin to slander, which is
where criticism becomes unlawful.

With that understanding, if the net outcome of intersectionality is to
shield a person from criticism, then it is intersectionality that is the
problem, not the ability to use it to shield oneself from criticism.
