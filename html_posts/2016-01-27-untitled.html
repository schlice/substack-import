**Content:** [Good luck lying to the police about your identity. Report
back to us after you try it (and after you get out of jail).\
\
For everyone else, lying to the police about your identity is illegal.
The crime is called **obstruction of justice** in most jurisdictions,
but it does have a few other names. Ask any lawyer in any district
attorney\'s office if you believe my statements may be in error.\
\
The police can (and often do) jail suspects who refuse to provide their
real identities. Once incarcerated, they can use all of your personal
effects confiscated from you to attempt to determine your true
identity.\
\
So like I said, go ahead and try to lie to the police about your
identity. Let us know how that works out for you.]{.rendered_qtext}
