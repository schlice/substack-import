Hmm.

14th Amendment, Section 3:

> *No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or
> elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or
> military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having
> previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of
> the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an
> executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the
> Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection
> or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies
> thereof. But Congress may, by a vote of two-thirds of each House,
> remove such disability.*

So let's take a look at how we got here (the point where we needed a
14th Amendment).

First, we need to understand that the 13th, the 14th, and the 15th
Amendments are what we call the ***Reconstruction Amendments***. They
were passed after the Civil War to "reconstruct" the United States and
to right some of the wrongs perpetrated by the Confederate states.

So as you can see, it is Congress which determines whether or not
someone is to be disqualified under Section 3, and a simple majority
from both houses would be all you would need to disqualify a President
as ineligible to serve.

And the case has already been to the Supreme Court in *Trump v.
Anderson* (2024), and it was specifically about Trump being removed from
state ballots because he was being labeled as someone who was not
qualified under Section 3. SCOTUS said that Congress determines
eligibility for federal officeholders, and states may only bar
candidates from state office.

So therefore, if Congress moves to disqualify the President, then he is
disqualified. If they do not, then he is not.

It's really that simple.

You are certainly free to hold the *opinion* that he is ineligible under
Section 3, but until Congress disqualifies him, then he remains
qualified. Your opinion does not make him ineligible or an
"unconstitutional President." Your opinion is your own. Congress is the
only authorized body which is able to make that determination, and since
everyone (including the President) is **innocent until proven guilty**,
he will have to actually be disqualified by Congress before he is
actually ineligible to serve.

\

But let's say you get your wish and Trump is disqualified under Section
3 of the 14th Amendment. What then what would happen? You'd have
President JD Vance for the next four years, and he will be able to
**appoint his own Vice President**. Is that the configuration you're
hoping for? Because that's what you'll get.

Be careful what you wish for.
