**Is there a federal immigration law or statute that permits the
separation of family; and, if not, can immigrant children sue the
federal government or head of agency in federal or UN courts?**

There is, in fact, federal immigration law that permits the children of
criminals to be removed while the criminals are processed through the
ICE criminal system for deportation back to their home country. Those
criminals are sent to prison, and since you can't have kids in prison,
your children are separated from you. The federal immigration law
pertains to people who illegally cross the border and attempt to enter
the country.

The people who have been separated from their children have attempted to
unlawfully enter this country. That means they broke the law. People who
break the law are colloquially known as "criminals."

Some argue that children are being separated from people who wish to
claim asylum. This may be true. However, there is also a legal process
to claim asylum, and it is **not** by unlawfully crossing the border.
The only people who have been separated from their children are people
who have unlawfully crossed the border. Asylum seekers who lawfully
present themselves to Customs officials and request political asylum do
not have their children separated from them.

Indeed, criminal aliens have, in some cases, been told that if they are
captured, they should claim asylum, because that's the "magic bullet"
that will keep you in the country. This is untrue. The magic bullet only
works if you present yourself at a border crossing and request asylum.
The magic bullet doesn't work if you sneak across the border and are
subsequently caught. You will be deported (and before you are, your
children may be separated from you) and you will be told to present
yourself at a border crossing and request political asylum.
