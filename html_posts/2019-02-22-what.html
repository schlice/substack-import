**What\'s the safest way to protect an infant during an emergency
landing?**

You can actually buy a seat for your infant, and strap their carrier in,
facing rearward, into the seat using the seat's own belt. Ideally, this
is the safest thing to do for an infant. If your child is over 22
pounds, they should be traveling in their own seat. Car seats will work,
or you can purchase a [[CARES

airlines allow you to use child restraints or car seats in their cabins;
you will need to check with your carrier before you buy that extra seat.

I will assume instead that you are discussing a lap-held infant. This is
the way infants travel most of the time.

This is a supplemental loop belt. It can be used as a belt extender for
plus-sized passengers, or it can be looped in with the passenger belt to
form a supplemental belt for a lap-held infant. Infants should wear one
of these during takeoff and landing. In the US and Canada, there is no
mandate for the airline to provide a loop belt for lap-held children. If
the aircraft has one on board, you can always ask for
one.[\[1\]](#PzmGx){#cite-PzmGx .citation_link}

The safest way to hold your infant in a brace position is this:

When you get on board, check the safety information card in the seat
back pocket in front of you. It will show the most current guidance for
lap-held children.
