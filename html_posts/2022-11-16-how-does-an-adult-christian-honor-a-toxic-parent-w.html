I got this one, as I am in this boat.

I broke down in church on Father's Day a number of years ago because I
was so conflicted with this. The Bible says, "Honor your father and
mother" in the Ten Commandments as well as in a few other places (Exodus
20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16; Matthew 15:4; Ephesians 6:2,3). But how do you
*honor* someone who is demonstrably evil or toxic?

The Bible does, if you are still a minor, tell you to accept their
authority, even if you do not respect or trust them. Colossians 3:20
says "Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the
Lord." (NIV) So when you are young, you honor your parents by
recognizing and accepting the authority God has given them.

But what if you are an adult? The Bible says that you are to
*appreciate* them (Proverbs 7:1, 2; 23:26), which in this case, means
thanking them for raising you, for providing a roof over your head, food
for your belly, and clothes for your back (inasmuch as they may have
done this; I don't know your personal situation. In my case, my parents
at least gave me this much). They also, at least, gave you the
foundation upon which you could become the Christian you are today
(which ultimately is your choice, not theirs). You can absolutely
appreciate that, and you can thank God that He gave you parents who did
this.

The Bible also commands us to treat them with *respect*. And I know
(personally) that this can be difficult, because some parents make it
extremely hard to respect them. Even so, the Bible tells us to avoid
disrespectful speech and actions (Proverbs 30:17). The Bible also tells
us that failing to treat them with respect is a serious offense (Matthew
15:4 Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9).

If your parents are older, you can honor them by *making sure they are
cared for* (1 Timothy 5:4,8). This doesn't mean you have to take them
into your home and become best buds, but you still have to ensure that
their needs are met. This is the basic standard we apply to everyone
(Love your neighbor as you love yourself), but more so for your own
parents. Even Jesus, right before He died, saw to the care of His mother
(John 19:25-27).

Look, I totally get it. I'm right where you are with my own parents. But
you can indeed *honor* your parents, even if you don't *like* them very
much.
