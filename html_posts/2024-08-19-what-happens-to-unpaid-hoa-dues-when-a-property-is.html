Depends on the jurisdiction and the lender.

As part of the sale process, the HOA must certify that there are no
outstanding HOA debts against the house before it can be sold. If there
are, in most cases in most states, the back payments will come out of
the sale of the home and go to the HOA before any proceeds go to the
seller.

In some cases, the debt transfers to the new owner, and they begin their
life in their new home in the hole with the HOA as well as with their
lender.
