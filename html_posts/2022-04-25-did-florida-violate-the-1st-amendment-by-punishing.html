***Did Florida violate the 1st Amendment by punishing Disney?***

No. And the reason why is written in the law which was passed (which
everyone seems to be glossing over).

Reedy Creek (and all of the other special districts which were ratified
before the State Constitution) will expire on June 1, 2023.

Here's the actual text of the amendment to Florida state law:

> 10 Section 1. Section 189.0311, Florida Statutes, is amended\
> 11 to read:\
> 12 189.0311 Independent special districts; charter\
> 13 requirements.---\
> 14 (1) Notwithstanding any general law, special act, or\
> 15 ordinance of a local government to the contrary, any independent\
> 16 special district charter enacted after September 30, 1989, shall\
> 17 contain the information required by s. 189.031(3). Recognizing\
> 18 that the exclusive charter for a community development district\
> 19 is the statutory charter contained in ss. 190.006-190.041,\
> 20 community development districts established after July 1, 1980,\
> 21 pursuant to the provisions of chapter 190 shall be deemed in\
> 22 compliance with this requirement.\
> 23 (2) Notwithstanding s. 189.072(2), any independent special\
> 24 district established by a special act prior to the date of\
> 25 ratification of the Florida Constitution on November 5, 1968,\
> 26 and which was not reestablished, re-ratified, or otherwise\
> 27 reconstituted by a special act or general law after November 5,\
> 28 1968, is dissolved effective June 1, 2023. An independent\
> 29 special district affected by this subsection may be\
> 30 reestablished on or after June 1, 2023, pursuant to the\
> 31 requirements and limitations of this chapter.\
> 32 Section 2. This act shall take effect July 1, 2022.

Now, you can argue that the text of the law may talk about special
districts containing information required by Florida Statute s.
189.031(3), and so any which do not are dissolved, and can be
reestablished, but **REALLY** it's about punishing Disney. But in order
to make this argument, it would be up to the complainant to **prove**
that this law was written specifically to retaliate against Disney for
the exercise of their freedom of speech. This would be extremely
difficult to do, given that the law very clearly states that these
special districts can immediately be reestablished with the required
information included. If Disney was allegedly "being punished" through
the removal of the special district, then the special district should
not be allowed to be reestablished. However, the law very clearly states
that the special district can indeed be re-established.

In addition, this all smacks of hypocrisy. Corporations can punish
states for positions that they don't like, but states can't do the same?
Remember before COVID dominated the headlines way back in 2016 when
North Carolina passed "HB2" which said that businesses could only allow
patrons to use the bathrooms of their birth genders? What did
corporations do? PayPal cancelled plans to move to Charlotte, along with
other businesses. The NBA pulled the Finals out of NC (which they
restored after HB2 was partially repealed), and many small corporations
followed suit.

But yet, when states allegedly do exactly the same thing, it's not okay?
The bottom line is that the law was duly enacted by a legitimate state
government. A corporation (based in another state) vowed to do
everything in its power to get that law repealed. And we're supposed to
all look the other way as if this is somehow okay?

***Will this decision be legally challenged?***

Without a doubt, yes. But it's unlikely that any of these challenges
will succeed. The complainants must prove that the law, ***as it was
passed,*** is specifically targeted at retaliation against Disney, and I
find it hard to believe that they would be successful at that. Remember,
it doesn't matter what the original motivations of the law writers was.
What matters is what was actually passed.

***How will this affect corporate/free speech going forward?***

If we're lucky, corporations will think twice before wading into a
state's politics.
