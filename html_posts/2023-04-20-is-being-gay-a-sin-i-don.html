The problem is that people have a hard time distinguishing between
*temptation* and *sinful acts*. In general, temptation to sin is not
sinful, but sinful acts are.

In other words, having a homosexual temptation is not sinful. Allowing
that temptation to go further into homosexual thoughts or homosexual sex
is sinful.

Just look at King David in the Bible. Or if you don't want to read the
story of David and Bathsheba, you can watch the old movie starring Cary
Grant. Same difference. Basically, David was up on his palace rooftop
one night when he saw Bathsheba in a nearby home taking a bath.

> It happened, late one afternoon, when David arose from his couch and
> was walking on the roof of the king's house, that he saw from the roof
> a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful. - 2 Samuel 11:2 ESV

David saw her accidentally; that was temptation. **But his sin occurred
when he didn't look away**. He kept looking, and he thought that she
"was very beautiful." His sin in thought led him to sin in action. The
accidental view wasn't a sin. **Allowing his mind to continue the
thought was.**

The Bible does indeed say that homosexual sex is sinful. The Bible is
replete with admonitions against homosexual behavior (all quotes from
NIV):

> Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman; that
> is detestable. --- Leviticus 18:22
>
> If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman,
> both of them have done what is detestable. They are to be put to
> death; their blood will be on their own heads. --- Leviticus 20:13 ยน
>
> Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of
> God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters
> nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men nor thieves nor the
> greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the
> kingdom of God. --- 1 Corinthians 6:9-10
>
> We also know that the law is made not for the righteous but for
> lawbreakers and rebels, the ungodly and sinful, the unholy and
> irreligious, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for
> murderers, for the sexually immoral, for those practicing
> homosexuality, for slave traders and liars and perjurers---and for
> whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine --- 1 Timothy 1:9-10

And lest you think that only gay men are implicated in the Bible,
lesbians are also specifically called out:

> Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their
> women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. In the
> same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were
> inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with
> other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.
> --- Romans 1:26--27

These passages are so clear that they defy reinterpretation. It's
intellectually dishonest to claim that Christians are misinterpreting
the Bible because of some prejudice against homosexuals.

But take heart, because we're *all* sinners. All of us have fallen short
of the glory of God. But God forgives those who repent of their sin and
turn to Him for salvation. If you truly repent (turn away) from your sin
and believe that Christ is your savior, He will give you the power to
overcome your sinful urges.

> No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is
> faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but
> with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you
> may be able to endure it. --- 1 Corinthians 10:13 ESV

All you gotta do is *ask*.

*ยน Remember the context: the book of Leviticus details God's commands
for the Jews, who had literally been slaves for generations and had no
idea how to live in community with each other without some form of
overlord controlling their lives.* ***We do not believe today that
homosexuals should be killed.*** *While homosexuality is a sin, we do
not kill people for committing sins. The rules were different back then.
Jesus literally fulfilled the law so the old law no longer applies.*
