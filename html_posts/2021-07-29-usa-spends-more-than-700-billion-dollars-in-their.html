While there are classified things which the military spends money on,
it's not as if the *vast* majority of military spending is classified.

For example, the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act stated the
following uses for their money:

> The bill authorizes appropriations to DOD for
>
> - Procurement, including aircraft, weapons and tracked combat
>   vehicles, shipbuilding and conversion, and missiles;
> - Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation;
> - Operation and Maintenance;
> - Working Capital Funds;
> - Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction;
> - Drug Interdiction and Counter-Drug Activities;
> - the Defense Inspector General;
> - the National Defense Sealift Fund;
> - the Defense Health Program;
> - the Armed Forces Retirement Home;
> - the Space Force;
> - Overseas Contingency Operations; and
> - Military Construction.
>

> The bill authorizes appropriations for base realignment and closure

> The bill authorizes appropriations and sets forth policies for

> National Nuclear Security Administration.

> The bill also sets forth policies regarding certain federal activities

> training and technical assistance to facilitate these measures.

There are other things the bill does, but these are the things related
directly to the outlay of funding.

So there's a lot that the DOD is spending money on, not just classified
superweapons.
