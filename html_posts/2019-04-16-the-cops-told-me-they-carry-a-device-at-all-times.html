**The cops told me they carry a device at all times that can hack into
your phone from a good distance away and be able to acesse my call\'s,
text\'s, photos and web search history when ever they want. Is this
true?**

I'll never say never, but this one is a pretty safe bet that it's
untrue. That technology simply doesn't exist.

There is a technique called "bluesnarfing," which allows a user to
remotely pair to your phone and download contacts but that only works on
much older versions of Bluetooth with certain security vulnerabilities.
None of today's modern phones are susceptible to being bluesnarfed.

There is also a similar technique called "bluesniping," wherein a
directional antenna and a small Linux embedded OS system are mounted on
a rifle stock. Bluesniping, with its highly directional antenna, was
said to work at over a mile away, far beyond the 10 meters that a normal
Bluetooth connection was capable of using.

Again, all of these techniques take advantage of security flaws in
Bluetooth technology that were patched years ago. The last time
bluesnarfing and bluesniping were showcased was 2004.

But even despite the technology, the law hasn't changed. Is it possible
that the police have some undisclosed vulnerability that they have
weaponized into a new bluesniping rig? Sure, it's possible. But to what
end? They can't use any of the information they steal in court, as it
was obtained illegally, through hacking. So even if they could hack into
your phone and get your calls, SMS messages, photos and web search
history, what are they going to do with it? Legally, there is absolutely
nothing they can do with it.

If they do have a warrant, they won't use bluesniping. They will go to
your carrier who will give them your call logs and SMS history. They may
also have records of your mobile data usage, including web searches, but
again, that's all with a warrant.
