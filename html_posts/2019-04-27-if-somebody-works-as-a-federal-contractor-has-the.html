**If somebody works as a federal contractor does having a security
clearance mean that they cannot talk about what they are working with
and if they do they will end up in prison?**

The answer is "it depends."

Not all parts of every federal contract are classified. In fact, it is
very infrequently that an *entire* federal contract is fully, 100%
classified. It is true that *parts* of some federal contracts involve
classified material and classified projects. But very rarely is an
entire federal contract 100% classified.

It is true that some federal contractors who work on some federal
contracts won't be able to discuss certain portions of their work.

However, simply possessing a security clearance does not mean they can't
talk about the entirety of what they do.
