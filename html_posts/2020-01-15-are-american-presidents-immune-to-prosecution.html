**Are American presidents immune to prosecution?**

The short answer is no.

The longer answer is that ***while a President is seated in office***,
as a matter of practicality and as a matter of Constitutionality, it is
unlikely that he can be prosecuted.

The Framers understood that such matters would be highly disruptive to
the good functioning of government, and that the will of the people was
the highest will to be followed. Therefore, it's simply impractical to
indict a President and subject him to the legal system while he's trying
to uphold his duties to which the people have elected him. To that end,
the framers devised a process by which some elected officials (and the
President) could be impeached and removed from office for crimes that
they committed while in office. This allows for the proper functioning
of government, while still reserving the possibility of criminal
indictment for after the President is removed from office.

Additionally, the structure of the government is such that *the entirety
of the Executive's power is vested in the President* ***alone****.* It
is not vested in the President and the Congress, or the President and
the Supreme Court. It is the President **alone** who is the chief
executive. The power of indictment *flows from the President* to any of
the Federal prosecutors who may seek to bring an indictment against him.
To that end, at least from a Constitutional standpoint, indicting a
President would be like a President using his prosecutorial authority to
indict himself. And while some may be bold enough to do so, I posit that
most presidents would not indict themselves. Therefore, since there
isn't a president who would consent to his prosecutorial power being
used against him, it's unlikely that any prosecutor has the actual
authority to indict the President while he is the Chief Executive.

There's a lot of "likely" and "possibly" answers here, because *it has
never happened before*. No president has ever been indicted while they
have been in office. This may be because the legal opinions tend towards
the opinion that I've spelled out here; that it is most likely
Constitutionally improbable that a President can be indicted while
President. To *fully* answer the question, it would have to happen, and
then the Constitutional question would have to be answered by the
Supreme Court.

***Once they are removed from office,*** they can then be a party to
lawsuits or criminal indictments. There are no protections against
lawless behavior for former Presidents.

Therefore, when a President commits a crime, the correct remedy is
impeachment and removal from office, and once the government is
functioning in its new configuration without that person, then
indictment for that crime.
