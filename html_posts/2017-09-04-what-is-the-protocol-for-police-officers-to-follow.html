It's easy to sit in judgment of the officers who did not stop the
detective from effecting an arrest. But those officers were in a really
tough spot. If you're going to intervene when a detective is working,
you had better be right, otherwise it's your own badge on the line. I
bet most of those officers were at least a little unsure that what he
was doing wasn't okay. Additionally, was he *beating* her like Rodney
King? Was he *abusing* her? No, he effected an arrest. It might have
been wrong, and it might have been legally misguided, but was it
something that they needed to physically step in and stop? Without
specific guidance about that, it would be really challenging for an
officer to step in and say, "Hey Detective, I think your judgment about
the facts of law here are slightly uninformed."

Also, I understand it was an incredible burden on Nurse Wubbels to be
arrested (and probably a traumatizing experience), but look at what the
outcomes will be:

1.  Detective Payne will most certainly be relieved of duty and will
    likely be fired. However, a review will need to be conducted. What
    in God's name could they possibly be *reviewing? Don't we have
    everything we need on body cam?* The standard used will be
    **knowledge at the time**. The question the review board will be
    asking is, "What should Detective Payne have known at the time he
    made the arrest?" In order to answer that, they will have to review
    his entire training curriculum from the Academy and every refresher
    training he has ever had. They will have to determine if he has ever
    been presented this material regarding getting physical samples from
    patients. If he has, then he "should have known" that she was
    factually correct in her determination.
2.  Nurse Wubbels will most certainly sue the department for false
    arrest, and false imprisonment, as well as compensation pain and
    suffering. She will likely settle out of court for an undisclosed
    sum. That sum will not be paltry. I say this not to minimize what
    Nurse Wubbels has been through, but she will be compensated for her
    trouble. Handily, I might add.

So in the end, this will all work out exactly as it should. The
detective who has a distinct lack of evidentiary knowledge will be
relieved of duty, and the nurse who was incorrectly arrested will get a
windfall.
