**Is recording a conversation in California in a scenario where the
participants can\'t expect privacy legal?**

So it appears you're asking specifically about situations which are
**not** telephone recordings, since there is an expectation of privacy
on a telephone call. Phone calls are covered by wiretap laws, and so
California's "two party requirement" to record phone calls is in full
effect on the phone.

However, recording conversations that are **not** over the telephone is
a whole different ballgame.

According to Harvard's Digital Media Law Project:

> If you are recording someone without their knowledge in a public or

I would say that this means that if you're a party to the conversation
and you're recording it, you *might* be legally okay to use that
recording as evidence, but if you're simply *eavesdropping* on a
conversation, you would probably not be covered. California enacted some
pretty tough anti-paparazzi laws, and they apply to video and audio
recordings related to people who are not party to the conversation.

As you can see, California recording privacy laws are really sketchy and
generally favor the rights of the individuals involved over the
admissibility of recording evidence. So if you are planning on making an
evidentiary recording that would be admissible in court, it would
probably be best in any setting to get the consent of everyone being
recorded before you start.
