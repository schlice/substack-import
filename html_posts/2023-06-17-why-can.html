I'm afraid that you're not quite understanding rights when you say that
you have a "right" to die.

Life is an *unalienable* right in the United States. That word
*unalienable* has a special definition. It means that no one can take
that right from you, **not even you**. *Even if you wanted to divest
yourself of your right to life*, you cannot do it. Your right to life
is, therefore, unalienable.

So do you have a "right" to die? In the United States, if you die
naturally, no one is charged with a crime, or violation of a law. But
anyone hastening a death or contributing to a death, *including you*,
could be subject to the law (depending on the action and the location).

This is why a terminally ill patient who can no longer sustain his own
life is never *killed*. They are only *removed from life support* and
are allowed to die naturally.

Big difference.

You may be *allowed* to die naturally, but you do not have "the right to
die," implying that you have the right to do anything you like in order
to make yourself die.

\

Beyond the legality of a "right to die" in the United States, asking the
question "why can't I just die" means you have a *desire* to die, but
your body will fight to stay alive, regardless of what you think you
want. So you can't "just die" as if your body is trying to die but some
external action is seemingly preventing you from naturally dying. I'm
pretty sure you are not a terminally ill patient typing on Quora with
your mind.

You are, instead, probably a person who has a *desire* to die and is
wondering why people won't let you.
