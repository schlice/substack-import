**In Washington, if all the seat belts are in use and if there are more
passengers, are they required to have a seat belt or not? If not, can
you give a source to be sure of this?**

Hi, I'm not sure if you mean Washington state or Washington, DC.

I'll give you the answer for Washnigton state.

RCW 46.61.688 (3)(4):

> Every person sixteen years of age or older operating or riding in a
> motor vehicle shall wear the safety belt assembly in a properly
> adjusted and securely fastened manner.
>
> No person may operate a motor vehicle unless all child passengers
> under the age of sixteen years are either: (a) Wearing a safety belt
> assembly or (b) are securely fastened into an approved child restraint
> device.

This means that the maximum number of people you can carry in your car
must equal the number of seat belts you have. Notice that it says *every
person* operating or riding in a motor vehicle *shall* wear the safety
belt, and the driver is responsible for making sure that everyone under
16 is in a belt.

It also says a little earlier in the statute that if your vehicle meets
the Federal safety standard (49 C.F.R. Sec. 571.208) and there is an
actual seating position with no seat belt, then it is not required.
However, all passenger vehicles of model years 2007 and later
(S4.1.5.2.2) have seat belts at all seating positions. So if your car is
older than 2007, it may actually have a valid seating position that may
not have a seat belt. It may have a lap belt only and no shoulder
harness. Regardless, whatever belt is present is required to be worn by
every passenger

Seat belt or not (depending on vehicle year), you can only carry the
number of people in the car as designated by the manufacturer. For
example, if your car is older, and you have a rear bench seat designed
for three people and the middle position does not have a shoulder
harness or a lap belt, you can't put four people in the back and have
the middle two with no seat belt and claim that it's legal for them to
ride there with no seat belt because there isn't one there anyway.
