Considering the fact that your personality is, in part, made up of your
past experiences, and considering that MS causes memory and cognition
issues, it is conceivable that the disease itself can change your
personality, as it will change what you remember about yourself.

It's a challenge, and many patients with MS do change, not just because
of physical changes in the brain, but because of many factors, including
side effects from the MS medications, side effects from the medications
taken to control the side effects of the MS medications, and general
psychological changes related to having a lifelong chronic disease like
MS.

I know, because this happened to me. I may not be "critical, angry,
paranoid and cruel," but my personality has changed, and it is hard for
my loved ones to understand why or how.

I wish I could go back to being "who I was," for their sakes, but I'm
afraid I don't know who that was. I feel exactly the same, in my own
mind. Which, I guess, is the problem, isn't it? If I don't know I've
changed, and if I don't know how I've changed, it would be very hard for
me to change back. It would be like becoming someone new. For me, I feel
like it's hard enough being who I am, let alone trying to become someone
else so that I can be more like someone I used to be, when I don't feel
any different in the first place. Why can't they just accept that this
is who I am now? Why do they want to make me someone I'm not?

See the problem?

This disease wears you down. Physically, mentally, emotionally, in every
way possible. It doesn't kill you, but after 24 years of having to deal
with it, I could understand how it could so wear you down that you'd
want to be dead. Your family wants to help you, but in doing so they
make you feel more like a cripple, so you really just want them to stop
or leave, so you subconsciously try to force them away by being bitter.

This is where some therapy for both the patient and the caregiver can be
very helpful. The patients need to understand that the caregivers are
only trying to help, and the caregivers need to understand that too much
helping actually hurts. The local [[MS Society

individual and group therapy which may be helpful.
