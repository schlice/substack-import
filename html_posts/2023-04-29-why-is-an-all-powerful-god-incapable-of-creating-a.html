**He is not incapable of creating such a world, but He doesn't because
He doesn't want to.**

The first question is the easy one. *Can God create an incorruptible
world?* And the answer to **any** question which starts with "Can God"
is **yes, God can.** As the literal All-Powerful Creator of the
Universeâ„¢, there is nothing that God cannot do. Full stop.

So if He *can,* why doesn't He? The answer must therefore be because He
doesn't want to.

But like a tantrum-filled two-year old, we continue to ask *why*. And
the more we do, the more we start to approach questions about
understanding the infinite mind of God, which we are incapable of doing.

In this case, however, we can at least answer why God would not create a
world that is incorruptible:

**An incorruptible world means a world without sin. And a world without
sin means a world with people who have no free will.**

That's right, God wants you to have free will. He wants you to be able
to choose between good and evil. And an incorruptible world contains no
evil. And God desires creatures with free will *so badly* that He will
create a world in which sin (evil) is capable of existing. Free will
means you can follow God's rules, or you can sin and disobey God's
rules.

So for the last *why* question, *why would God want to give you the
ability to choose to reject Him?*

And the answer is because **God is love.** And love, by definition, can
only be freely given, it can never be coerced. So God wants to freely
give love, and He wants you to *freely* accept love, knowing that there
is an alternative, and that there is nothing preventing you from making
either choice freely, without coercion.

God wants communion only with people who freely, gladly, choose Him,
knowing the alternative, and choosing Him anyway. *That's* what God
desires.

And that's why God did not create a world incapable of experiencing sin.
