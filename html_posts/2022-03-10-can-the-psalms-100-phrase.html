The answer to this question is ***absolutely!***

Let me preface this by saying that I am a church musician. I have been a
church musician for my entire life, ever since I was old enough to sing
in the choir, old enough to reach the pedals on the organ, and old
enough to strum a guitar. Then I became a Christian and I have been
worshipping and leading worship in a number of Christian churches around
the country.

One of the problems we face as church musicians is making sure that our
motivation is pure. We need to ensure that we are there for God, and not
there for us. We're not there to *perform*, unless we understand that
*we perform for an audience of ONE*. We are there to lead, to assist the
congregation in their worship, not to perform **FOR THEM**. We perform
for God. Our music serves to enhance worship.

But who is to say what type of music? If you grew up on chancel organ
music, and you find that it sets the condition of your heart to worship
(as I did, and it still does), then fine! If 60's and 70's folk worship
songs are your cup of tea, great! (I still have those songs stuck in my
head on a never-ending loop) And if contemporary Christian music is what
energizes you and focuses your heart on worship, awesome!

But how about this?

Are these folks worshipping God? Is their worship any more or less
worthy than mine? OF COURSE NOT! THEIR WORSHIP IS JUST AS WORTHY AS
MINE, and it's almost *blasphemous* to say otherwise!

It is GOD who determines whether or not your worship is pleasing and
acceptable! **And it is the condition of the heart which God judges.**

Be careful to not fall into the trap of judging them because you are not
a fan of the way they look, or the sound their musicians make. Because
this could be said as much for Gregorian Chant as it can for chancel
organ music, 60's folk group worship, or contemporary Christian music.

**TL;DR:** The style of the music does not make the worship any more or
less pleasing to God. *The condition of the heart of the worshipper
does.*

Original question:

Can the Psalms 100 phrase \"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord\" be
stretched to apply to contemporary Christian songs in the heavy metal,
rock hip hop or rap mode?
