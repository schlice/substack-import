**If I root my Android phone that is running LineageOS 15.1, is it
possible for a malicious app to gain root access without me being able
to deny it?**

The default root method is through ADB only, so apps running in the OS
can't gain direct access to root.

If you entered developer mode and applied root access to "Apps and ADB"
or "Apps" only, then apps can use root at will. Malicious apps can gain
root access without your knowledge.

This is why LineageOS devs recommend you [[install the SuperSU
package](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f98464&url=http://www.lineageosdownloads.com/root-lineage-os){.external_link

qt-tooltip="lineageosdownloads.com"}]{.qlink_container} by Chainfire,
arguably the best root management package available for Android today.
This gives you total control over what apps can gain root access, giving
you allow/deny control over each app's root requests.

For anyone who needs to add root to their LineageOS installs, I highly
recommend you add Chainfire's
[[SuperSU](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=db0844&url=http://www.supersu.com/download){.external_link
