  legal for them to mess with your mind. Example: make you look crazy mentally to

**Content:** [Investigators have many tools at their disposal. Police
investigators can even lie to suspects during interrogation in order to
convince them to reveal information that they would not normally
reveal.\
\
However, if an investigator was interacting with a suspect for the sole
purpose of \"making him look crazy\" or \"messing with his mind,\" that
would fall squarely in the category of harassment.\
\
To determine if one is mentally capable of standing trial, understanding
the concept of right and wrong, etc., a psychiatric evaluation is
conducted. That is not the job of the police investigator, but of a
psychiatrist.]{.rendered_qtext}
