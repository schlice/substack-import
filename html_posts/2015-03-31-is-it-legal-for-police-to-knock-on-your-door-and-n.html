**Content:** [Yes, an officer in uniform is not under any obligation to
show you his/her ID card unless you ask for it. Otherwise, they\'d wear
it instead of a badge.\
\
Before you open your door, you have the right to ask to see ID at any
time of any person claiming to be a law enforcement officer. There is no
jurisdiction that I know of that does not require that a police officer
carry their ID while in uniform, even if they are wearing a badge. They
are required to show you their ID, or you could have a valid suspicion
that the person in front of you is just playing dress-up.\
\
If you ask a police officer for their ID and they do not show you, I\'d
call 911 right away. Tell the dispatcher that \"police officers\" are at
my house and they did not show me ID when I asked; are these real police
officers? The dispatcher will tell you whether or not there are police
assigned to be at your residence; if not, they will send real police
officers to verify. If they are real police officers, you can treat them
as real police officers. Continue to do what they tell you and make sure
you file a complaint with the department.]{.rendered_qtext}
