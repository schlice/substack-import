All religions should have religious freedom protections, not just
Christians.

The Indiana anti-abortion law was written in such a way as to specify
that life begins at conception. This is what caused them issue, since
the plaintiffs in this case argued that there are other non-Christian
religions which do not hold that life begins at conception, specifically
Judaism and Islam, as well as other "independent spiritual belief
systems."

The non-Christian litigants are being represented by the ACLU.
\"Although some religions believe that human life begins at conception,
this is not an opinion shared by all religions or all religious
people,\" the ACLU said in a statement.

Therefore, the religious beliefs of these non-Christian religions are
being substantially burdened by a law which has at its basis the claim
that life begins at conception.

Indiana legislators should take note: **how you word your laws
matters.**

(EDIT) I will add that I think Indiana's judges missed the point of
these laws. A law which states that abortions are illegal does not
unduly burden any religion. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act (both
the Federal version and Indiana's version) prohibits the government from
substantially burdening anyone's religious beliefs *except "in
furtherance of a compelling governmental interest,"* and it requires
politicians to use "the least restrictive means" possible. The
government has a compelling interest in protecting innocent life, and no
less restrictive means are available than prohibiting abortion.

"Science, not religion, tells us that abortion kills a human being," a
spokesperson for Attorney General Todd Rokita (R) said in a statement.
"When a legislature outlaws abortion, it extends the same ethical
judgment embodied in laws prohibiting homicide. Making ethical judgments
about the treatment of human beings is a compelling function of
government. Indeed, the very nature of law is to make ethical judgments
about human actions and their consequences. Just because a legal rule
effects an ethical judgment does not make it 'religious.'"

In other words, even if there was a religion which expressly authorized
murder, the state could still pass a law making murder illegal; and
while it would substantially burden that religion, it is done in
furtherance of a compelling governmental interest (the protection of
innocent life), and it is done by the least restrictive means possible
(there is no less restrictive means available other than to make it
illegal).

Abortion laws follow the same ethical standards, and are not
religiously-based. But even if they are, the same philosophy applies.
