**Can crimes you commit as a minor affect you being able to purchase a
gun?**

The answer, as with all legal answers, is "it depends."

Each state is different when it comes to the handling of juvenile court
records. Some states automatically seal juvenile records when the
juvenile reaches a certain age, and other states require the juvenile to
petition the court to seal the records.

Some states will not seal records of juveniles who have committed
certain crimes, such as anything which would be a felony in the adult
justice system, and still other states will not seal former juvenile
records if the now-adult has a history of continued criminal activity.
Finally, not all states consider "juvenile felonies" a thing, as not all
states consider crimes which *could have been* prosecuted as felonies as
an adult as a crime for a juvenile.

So, to summarize all the possibilities:

- *If* you committed a crime as a juvenile, and
- *if* that crime would have been prosecuted as a felony in adult
  courts, and
- *if* the state in which you committed the crime judges "juvenile
  felonies" to be a prohibited category, and
- *if* your records could not be sealed because of state law, or your
  records were not sealed before you attempted to purchase a gun,
- ...*then* it is possible that your juvenile crime could generate a
  "deny" on a NICS check.

Off the top of my head, the only state I know of which even looks at
"juvenile felonies" is Virginia[\[1\]](#ZKJcB){#cite-ZKJcB
