The **driver** should be obligated to wear a seat belt. Just read all
the answers to this question to find out why. Primarily it is to keep
the driver in a position in the car so they can keep control of the
vehicle.

**Passengers under 18** should be obligated to wear seat belts anywhere
in the car, front or back. People are stupid, and parents are even more
so. Don't kill kids through parental stupidity. Sometimes we have to
mandate things to get past stupid parents.

But beyond those two restrictions, no one else should have to wear seat
belts. For everyone except the driver, it should be your choice as to
whether or not you choose to wear a seat belt. They force the front-seat
passenger to wear a seat belt in my state, but they don't force
motorcycle riders to wear helmets. I can't understand the lack of logic
in that. The only thing I can figure is that the front seat passenger
might fly around the interior of the vehicle in a crash and somehow
interfere with the driver maintaining control of the vehicle, but even
that's a stretch. They mandated front seat passengers wear seat belts
after that location in the car became known as the "death seat" because
so many front seat passengers were killed in auto accidents, and
legislators had to "do something" about that.
