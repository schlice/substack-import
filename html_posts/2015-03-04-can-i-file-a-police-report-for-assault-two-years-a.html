**Content:** [You can file a police report any time you like. It\'s
called an \"informational report\" and you can go fill one out at any
time.\
\
Criminally, most states have between a one and two year statute of
limitations on assault, so it\'s unlikely that your assailant will be
arrested. If the assault was a felony assault, some jurisdictions allow
up to three years for prosecutors to file charges, where misdemeanor
assault statutes of limitations expire, generally, within one to two
years. You will have to check the laws of your jurisdiction to see
whether or not you can talk to an attorney and pursue criminal charges.\
\
However, to bring a civil lawsuit for assault, the statute of
limitations is generally much longer. You generally will have more time
to file a civil suit than to pursue criminal charges.\
\
Bear in mind, regardless of what you intend to do with said report,
because the assault happened two years ago, memories will be fuzzy, and
it will be harder to make your case after such time has passed.\
\
As always, seek the advice of an attorney, especially one who offers
free consultations.]{.rendered_qtext}
