**Is it possible to gain control of my home phone number? AT&T
disconnected it and will not port the number without my paying a \$99.00
\"installation fee\".**

In general, you must port your number while your line is still active.
Canceling your phone line service generally implies releasing control of
your number. You're probably out of luck on that number unless you
restart service with AT&T. Looks like it may be time for a new number.

In fact, for most carriers, the "port out" process cancels your line
automatically. So there is no need to cancel your line; when you port
out your number, your line cancels pretty much the same day as your port
out.

Be sure you record the day your carrier approved the port out so that
you can complain later when they continue to charge you for the line.
