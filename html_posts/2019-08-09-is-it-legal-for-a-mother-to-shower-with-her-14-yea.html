**Is it legal for a mother to shower with her 14 year old son?**

Not sure why I'm seeing an A2A on a question with over 100 answers, but
since I was asked, I'll answer.

I'll provide the simple answer, since it seems that much of the morality
of such a scenario has already been discussed. I will not discuss the
morality of such behavior.

The specific question asked was "is it legal."

In most states, a mother and her son showering together (i.e. using the
shower at the same time) is not illegal. There are specific behaviors
while in the shower which *could* be illegal (if they stray into sexual
territory), but the simple act of a mother and son sharing a shower at
the same time is, by itself, generally not illegal.

Whether or not this behavior *should* be illegal is a matter for much
debate, as you can see by the wealth of varied opinions in this thread.

But it's not, at its most simple activity, illegal.
