**Can someone take legal action against you if mail is going to their
home? I have moved several times and every time I do I make a change of
address. I even contact my bill collectors, doctors, etc.**

As in, you're maliciously allowing your old mail to go to their address?
You are indeed a monster.

As long as you've filled out a change of address card and you've
notified your creditors and others who routinely send you mail of your
new address, you can't be held responsible for a company sending your
mail to your old address. You can't force companies to do things right.
They will make mistakes, and often do. It even takes time to process a
change of address, and some mail will still go to your old address.
Additionally, certain items are never forwarded, like periodicals or
circulars.

Besides, it costs the new addressee nothing to write RETURN TO SENDER -
NO LONGER AT THIS ADDRESS on an envelope and throw it back in the
outgoing mail but a few seconds of their precious time.

There's simply no cause for legal action there.
