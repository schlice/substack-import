I understand your point about heat intolerance I totally get that. I get
super tired when I'm out in the heat too long. I'll spend a day outside
and then go home and take a nap because I literally can't keep my eyes
open.

Just be cautious to not totally avoid the sun just so you can avoid the
heat.
