**The family of Breonna Taylor received 12 million in civil court. If
this event led to a cash settlement and law changes needed to be made,
doesn\'t it make more sense to charge the officers and force them to pay
rather than the uninvolved taxpayers?**

Maybe. But those investigations are still ongoing.

That's why most people say that this payout by Louisville was premature
and that the mayor's office does not support the officers who work
there.[\[1\]](#tkYGl){#cite-tkYGl .citation_link}

While the payout may still have been made, most people still believe
that the payout should have waited until the conclusion of the
investigation into the officers' conduct. Kentucky Attorney General
Daniel Cameron appointed himself special prosecutor to look into whether
criminal charges should be filed against the officers in the case. No
timeline has been released for that decision. The FBI also is conducting
a separate investigation in her shooting. And usually, it is the
Department of Justice which investigates shootings to see if the
victim's civil rights were violated.

None of this was allowed to complete before the city decided to pay.

While taxpayers are probably happy that the estate of Breonna Taylor
will have some financial compensation for her death, taxpayers are also
likely watching the results of the investigations to see if they should
have paid at all.
