Never cleaned floors with a toothbrush.

But my training NCO was not happy with the 5 o'clock shadow I had
developed one day, was convinced that I didn't know how to shave (or
that I was just lazy and didn't do it) and told me to report to his door
with a razor.

Which I did.

He then told me to shave. In front of his door, at attention. Yes, *dry
shave*.

After he was satisfied that I had shaved enough, I returned to my room.
I hadn't looked in the mirror, but my roommate was worried for my safety
when he saw all the blood on my neck.
