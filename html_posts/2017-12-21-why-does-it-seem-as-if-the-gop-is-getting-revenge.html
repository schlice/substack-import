**Why does it seem as if the GOP is getting revenge for the United
States twice voting for Barack Obama? Have they ever been this
bloodthirsty before?**

You answered your own question. It *seems* that way. It's your
interpretation of what you're seeing.

I'm going to link you over to another answer to a previous Quora
question: [[*What do you think happened to America to bring about a
President like
Trump?*](https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-happened-to-America-to-bring-about-a-President-like-Trump/answer/Anthony-Zarrella)]{.qlink_container}
This answer, I think, perfectly encapsulates what Republicans were
*feeling* after eight years of an Obama administration.

Many of the policies you see being implemented now are policies that you
would never see during an Obama administration. So while they are not
implementing these policies *in order to be vindictive,* the appearance
is that these policies are exactly opposite of how we were doing things,
but that's because the policies we are implementing now are in direct
contradiction to the last eight years of US policy, both foreign and
domestic.

And they are not *bloodthirsty*; they are *determined* to implement the
policies they believe will be helpful to this country, and to its
people. This is what they were elected to do, and they're doing it.
