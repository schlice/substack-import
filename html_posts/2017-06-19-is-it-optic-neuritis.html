The answer is it "might" be optic neuritis.

Even more ambiguous, if it is ON, it "might" be MS.

You should consult with an eye doctor (ophthalmologist) regarding the
eye pain, and if he/she believes it is ON, you should return to your
primary care doctor to be scheduled for a MRI of the brain. If your MRI
shows signs of someone with MS, you should find a neurologist in your
area who specializes in MS to continue the investigation.

Good luck.
