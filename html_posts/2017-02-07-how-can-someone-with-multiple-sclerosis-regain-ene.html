MS fatigue, also known as MS Lassitude, is one of the most common
symptoms of MS. It's estimated that 80% of MS patients have experienced
MS fatigue at one time or another.

Fatigue in people with MS can have many different causes. For example,
if your MS includes bladder dysfunction and you have to get up in the
middle of the night to use the bathroom, the lack of sleep can be a
cause of fatigue. Depression can cause fatigue. Certain medications can
induce fatigue as a side effect. Finally, there are other diseases such
as thyroid issues and anemia which can also lead to fatigue.

People who have MS and get stressed by heat also experience fatigue.
Over-exposure to heat, or over-exertion, can also bring on MS fatigue.

Because there are so many issues which could potentially be causing your
fatigue, **if your fatigue is interfering with your life, you should
first seek the advice of your doctor.** He should review your
medications with you, see if anything needs to be modified, and if all
other avenues are exhausted, perhaps prescribe a medication which has
demonstrated some benefit to some people with MS fatigue.

The National MS Society recommends the following interventions for
someone who experiences fatigue:

> - Occupational therapy to simplify tasks at work and home.
> - Physical therapy to learn energy-saving ways of walking (with or
>   without assistive devices) and performing other daily tasks, and to
>   develop a regular exercise program.
> - Sleep regulation, which might involve treating other MS symptoms
>   that interfere with sleep (e.g., spasticity, urinary problems) and
>   using sleep medications on a short-term basis.
> - Psychological interventions, such as stress management, relaxation
>   training, membership in a support group, or psychotherapy.
> - Heat management --- strategies to avoid overheating and to cool
>   down.

So my advice? First see your doctor, then think about some of these
other interventions to assist with regaining some energy. Will you ever
have enough energy to run again? It's hard to say. Fatigue, like MS, is
different for everyone who experiences it. It's important to continue
some exercise regimen while you can, so keep moving, even if it's just
walking and not running.

Good luck!
