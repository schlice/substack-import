There are no solid statistics, because most states do not require guns
to be registered. I wish I could make the answer a little more detailed,
but there simply aren't any good statistics related to registered
firearms because there are no standards requiring states to register
firearms.

But I might ask you, to what end would register a gun? Registration is
not necessary in order to track "stolen" guns. Most gun owners I know
keep meticulous records of the serial numbers on their own firearms so
that they can report this information to the police should the weapon be
stolen. I gifted a gun to my brother, and within a week of him owning
the gun, it was stolen from the house he was renting. Because I had the
serial number, I was able to provide it to the police. The gun was,
sadly, never recovered.

But what good would registration do? What benefit is there to register a
gun? We don't register other major purchases we make. We don't register
steak knives, but those kill more people in domestic disturbances than
guns do. We don't register chain saws or axes. We register cars, but
that's mostly to ensure that the vehicle has paid the taxes required by
the state to maintain the roads on which that car will drive.

So I ask again: why register guns?
