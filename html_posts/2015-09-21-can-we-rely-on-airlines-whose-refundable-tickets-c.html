**Content:** [Refundable tickets cover the airline for their cost of
holding a seat for you and then you not showing up. It costs them much
more when you book a ticket and then fail to show up than it does for
them to book the right amount of seats. It screws everything up, but
most importantly it screws up their planning, since all of their
planning algorithms are based on ticket sales.\

FYI, it\'s cheaper for you to buy a non-refundable ticket and pay the
change fee plus the difference than to buy a refundable
ticket.]{.rendered_qtext}
