<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [\> because it can work most effectively on a federal<br>level\<br>\<br>Untrue in a Constitutional republic like the United States. It works far<br>more effectively in the United States at the state level than the<br>federal level.\<br>\<br>\>Those with the most stringent gun control laws have less gun violence<br>than those with looser laws\<br>\<br>The most intelligent answer I can provide: Duh. Of COURSE you will have<br>less gun violence if you reduce the number of guns out there. If that\'s<br>your narrow goal, you will absolutely reduce gun violence by reducing<br>guns.\<br>\<br>But what happens with the corresponding increase in knife violence and<br>baseball-bat violence? It seems to me that the *violence* is the<br>problem, not the implement used to commit the violence. Granted, a gun<br>is purpose-built to kill, so a killer can do so with great efficiency<br>using a gun, but he can equally kill efficiently using a knife, or a<br>baseball bat, or a car. I\'m not sure that focusing on the gun will<br>reduce *violence*.\<br>\<br>If your goal is to reduce violence where guns are involved, removing<br>guns will definitely reduce that violence. But a violent criminal will<br>use whatever weapons he can get his hands on to commit violent crimes. A<br>killer is still a killer whether or not he uses a gun.\<br>\<br>I get your point, since a gun is so efficient, a killer can do more<br>damage with it (which is why we limit nuclear proliferation). But how<br>are gun laws going to keep guns out of criminals\' hands? They don\'t<br>buy them from the same place that I buy my guns. The whack-jobs do, but<br>if we can simply keep the guns out of their hands, then we\'ve solved<br>that problem. Violent criminals buy guns on the black market. There are<br>no amount of laws you can pass that will stem that flow. Look how well<br>it has worked for illegal drugs. The drug trade persists, despite the<br>laws. Outlaw guns and only the bad guys, buying them on the black<br>market, will have them.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Joe-the-Plumber-stated-Your-dead-kids-dont-trump-my-constitutional-rights-Is-he-right-Why-or-why-not/answer/David-Joyce-11<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
