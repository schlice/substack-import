**Content:** [\> because it can work most effectively on a federal
level\
\
Untrue in a Constitutional republic like the United States. It works far
more effectively in the United States at the state level than the
federal level.\
\
\>Those with the most stringent gun control laws have less gun violence
than those with looser laws\
\
The most intelligent answer I can provide: Duh. Of COURSE you will have
less gun violence if you reduce the number of guns out there. If that\'s
your narrow goal, you will absolutely reduce gun violence by reducing
guns.\
\
But what happens with the corresponding increase in knife violence and
baseball-bat violence? It seems to me that the ***violence*** is the
problem, not the implement used to commit the violence. Granted, a gun
is purpose-built to kill, so a killer can do so with great efficiency
using a gun, but he can equally kill efficiently using a knife, or a
baseball bat, or a car. I\'m not sure that focusing on the gun will
reduce ***violence***.\
\
If your goal is to reduce violence where guns are involved, removing
guns will definitely reduce that violence. But a violent criminal will
use whatever weapons he can get his hands on to commit violent crimes. A
killer is still a killer whether or not he uses a gun.\
\
I get your point, since a gun is so efficient, a killer can do more
damage with it (which is why we limit nuclear proliferation). But how
are gun laws going to keep guns out of criminals\' hands? They don\'t
buy them from the same place that I buy my guns. The whack-jobs do, but
if we can simply keep the guns out of their hands, then we\'ve solved
that problem. Violent criminals buy guns on the black market. There are
no amount of laws you can pass that will stem that flow. Look how well
it has worked for illegal drugs. The drug trade persists, despite the
laws. Outlaw guns and only the bad guys, buying them on the black
market, will have them.]{.rendered_qtext}
