*Maybe.*

As I understand it, when Ralph Yarl rang the doorbell (to the wrong
house), Andrew Lester fired two shots through the door, striking Yarl in
the head and the arm.

Lester's account says that he was awoken by his doorbell, and he went to
the door and found a large black male pulling on his exterior door, and
he thought his home was being broken into. He fired twice, and the man
ran away. He then called 911. Lester said firing his weapon \"was the
last thing he wanted to do, but he was \'scared to death\'\" because of
his age and the male's size, according to police reports.

Yarl's account tells a different story. He says that he did not pull on
the door, but instead rang the doorbell and waited. He says that a man
opened the door holding a firearm, and he was immediately shot in the
head, and he fell to the ground. He was shot again in the arm, and he
claims he heard a voice say, "Don't come around here."

Investigation is still ongoing, but Lester claimed that he was in fear
for his life (rightly or wrongly). If he truly believed someone was
breaking in to his house, and he truly was in fear for his life, he may
be protected by Missouri's "stand your ground" law. Recall that in
Missouri, if you are legally allowed to be in a place, then you also
have a right to protect yourself if you reasonably believe you're in
imminent threat of deadly harm. Personally, I'm not sure I could find it
reasonable to believe that a home invader would ring your doorbell, but
perhaps the case could be made that the invader was first checking to
see if anyone was home before attempting to break in.

He will not be charged with a hate crime, because he is currently being
charged with Assault 1 (Assault in the First Degree), which is a higher
level of charge than attempted murder, and is also four degrees higher
than a hate crime modifier could raise the charge.
