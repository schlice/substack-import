Chocolate and "crisps" (you must be from the UK, in America they are
potato chips) are fine to serve as "treats." Even daily. There's nothing
inherently "wrong" with either chocolate or crisps.

However, there are several reasons why you should delay the introduction
of sweets and high-fat, high-sodium, high-calorie foods as long as you
can. The main reason is that while you still have control over their
diets, you want to introduce healthy eating habits, demonstrate healthy
eating habits, and encourage those habits. If you can do this while
showing that chocolate and crisps should be eaten in moderation, and
only as "treats," then by all means, go ahead.

Also, while your children are developing (and 18 months is during the
"critical" development periods, while their brains are developing at the
most rapid rates), and since you want to give your kids the best
possible chance at a good, healthy life, giving them the most nutritious
meals you can give them is crucial. Giving them "empty" calories (foods
which are high calorie and high fat with very little additional
nutrition) is not beneficial to their growth and development. During
this period, they need the most nutritious foods you can give them, and
snack foods are not them.

Again, not to disparage chocolate and crisps as they are lovely, but
while you have the opportunity to set your kids on the healthiest, best
path, wouldn't you do so?
