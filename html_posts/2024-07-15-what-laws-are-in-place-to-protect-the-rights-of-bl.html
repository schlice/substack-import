There are two specific sets of laws in place: one for housing, and one
for employment.

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) applies to employment. It
basically says that you cannot discriminate in hiring based on
disability. Employers must list the physical requirements of the job,
and then can only ask the candidate if they can perform the essential
tasks of the job, **with or without reasonable accommodations**. They
must then provide those ***reasonable*** accommodations if the employee
requests it.

The Fair Housing Act (FHA) says essentially the same thing about finding
a place to live. A landlord cannot discriminate against people with
disabilities, and they must provide accommodations for the handicapped.
