**Content:** [*Yes I do have a right to be safe from other people. What
are you crazy? It not a matter of being offended, I have a right to know
who is packing and who isn\'t.*\
I was unaware that concealed carry records were public knowledge. How
exactly do you expect to know who is carrying a weapon? That\'s exactly
the point of concealed carry: no one knows! You\'ll never know if
someone is conceealing a weapon; chances are, many people you pass every
day are carrying, and you just don\'t know it. Chew on THAT for a
while.\
\
*I have a right to have a reasonable expectation of being safe in the
public square and just because you pass a background check doesn\'t mean
you could hit water if you fell out of a boat.*\
You have no such right. Please show me where in the Bill of Rights you
have a right to be safe in the public square. Who exactly is going to
guarantee your right? The police? If you get shot in public, are you
going to sue the government for not keeping you safe? The police don\'t
even have to keep you safe! Were you aware that the police are charged
with enforcing laws, which means that people have to violate the law
first before it can be enforced? We don\'t have the *Minority Report*
machine yet, so we can\'t know whether or not someone is going to break
the law before they do it, so police only enforce the law *after*
someone violates it. They are not mandated to protect you (unless you
are in their custody). The police are there to make sure that those who
break the law are brought to justice. It would be nice if they could
actually prevent crime from happening, but that\'s a pipe dream. And
with the miniscule number of police officers to citizens, good luck
getting one to help you within a reasonable amount of time after a crime
has been committed, anyway. Ultimately, in a free society, you are
responsible for your own safety.. The police are unable to stop crime
before it happens, so it\'s up to you to protect yourself.\
\
*You can keep you gun on you property, the second you go out in public
your ability to make decisions about how you use a gun is my business as
well as everyone elses and you you can\'t understand that then we simply
disagree.*\
If you live in a state which has open carry, this is mostly not true, as
there are no licensing requirements for open carry. For concealed carry,
of course you have to be permitted, but it\'s usually nothing more than
a half-day class that teaches you how to properly hold a gun, and even
still, that doesn\'t make their licensing \"your business.\" You have no
right to know that information about someone else. There is no state in
which the concealed carry permit records of the local police or the
sheriff are public record. And how I use my gun is my business, not
yours. If I choose to kill you with it, that\'s my business. I will
likely face consequences, but that\'s my choice. The government already
ran a background check on me, and that ensures that I\'m not a felon. If
that background check is not sufficient for you, you will need to lobby
to improve the background checks we already have. But to be honest, the
problem is not the background check, it\'s with the state of mental
health treatment in this counrtry, and deinstitutionalization was not
the correct answer.\
\
*So please go argue with someone else because frankly current law is on
my side on this issue. Most states require you a permit have you get a
permit to carry in public and those that don\'t are just foolish.*\
I\'m sorry, you have a poor grasp of current law. As I said, you only
need a permit if you wish to conceal a weapon. If you want to open
carry, normally no permits are required, and that\'s in nearly every
state where open carry is allowed. You don\'t need a permit to buy a
gun. In almost all states, you don\'t need a permit to own a gun (which
*Heller* found was unconstitutional anyway, so these ownership permit
states are slowly going away as their ownership permit laws are being
challenged). You need a permit to conceal a weapon, but that\'s about
it.\
\
I\'m not sure where you get this idea that what people do with their own
lives is somehow your business. If you feel threatened by someone else,
it\'s your responsibility to protect yourself and your family; it\'s not
their responsibility to assuage your fears. Time to grow up and learn to
defend yourself instead of waiting and hoping someone else will do it
for you.]{.rendered_qtext}
