**Content:** [It\'s not legal to force anyone to have sex, ever.\
\
The law says that all sex must be consensual, and anyone can say NO or
STOP at any time, even while in the middle of the act, and it must stop
immediately, or it is considered rape.\
\
Both parties to the sex must consent. Both parties must be of a mental
state in which they can consent (i.e. not high or drunk out of
coherence). If any of this is not true, it\'s rape.\
\
Both parties must be of the age of majority in order to consent. In this
situation, regardless of whether or not there is verbal consent, it is
considered \"statutory rape\".]{.rendered_qtext}
