**Can President Trump pardon his impeachment(s)?**

Impeachment is a political remedy and it is not related to whether or
not someone has broken a law. Pardons are for **federal crimes**. You
can't pardon an impeachment.

Impeachments are for "high crimes and misdemeanors" but since
impeachment is a political remedy, it doesn't necessarily have to be a
violation of law which triggers an impeachment. Even speech which is
perfectly legal, but unbecoming the office of the president (which is
exactly what he did), is impeachable.
