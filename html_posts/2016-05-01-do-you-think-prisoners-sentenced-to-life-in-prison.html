**Content:** [They do, in far greater numbers than you might realize.
It\'s called suicide.\
\
As for a convict converting his life sentence to a death sentence,
**never going to happen.** Where the death sentence is carried out, the
bar that must be hurdled is very high.\
\
As an example, remember James Holmes? He was the Aurora (Colorado)
theater shooter. He was 2/3 of the way through the process to be
sentenced to death and phase three found that he would be better served
by spending life in a mental institution. While my desire for
retribution is pretty high, the ruling was correct. Holmes is most
definitely insane. He shouldn\'t die at the state\'s hand because he is
mentally diseased. He also shouldn\'t get to opt in to his own death,
for the same reason.\
\
And also, suicide is technically illegal, so the state cannot condone
it.]{.rendered_qtext}
