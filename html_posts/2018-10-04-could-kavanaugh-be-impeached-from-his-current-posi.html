**Could Kavanaugh be impeached from his current position (Circuit Judge
of the U.S. Court of Appeals- D.C. Circuit) if he is proven guilty of
Perjury before Senate Committee?**

Kavanaugh can be impeached for any reason that Congress considers
impeachable.

Impeachment is a political process, not a legal one. He doesn't need to
be proven guilty of perjury (which is a virtual impossibility --- I'll
link one of my other answers explaining why below). If he is not
approved to sit on the Supreme Court because of these allegations, it
also stands to reason that he's not fit to continue to sit on the DC
Circuit because of them, and this alone can be grounds for impeachment.

But just as we've discussed with the President, the impeachment process
for other Federal officers is the same. The House must pass Articles of
Impeachment (which will be simple if they gain a majority in November).
Then, the Senate must have a trial at which the Chief Justice (in the
case of a Presidential impeachment) or the Vice President serves as the
judge. The Senate must then vote by supermajority (2/3 of the Senators
present) to remove him from office.

In our nation's history, one SCOTUS Justice and fourteen other Federal
judges have been impeached. Only eight of the Federal judges impeached
were removed from office by the Senate. The SCOTUS Justice, Samuel
Chase, was impeached in 1804 but was acquitted by the Senate.
