**What do you think about President Trump, signing an executive order,
to end family separations? \"We\'re going to be signing an executive
order in a little while... We\'ve got to be keeping families
together.\"**

Trump's in a tough spot. He won't refuse to enforce the law like
previous administrations did. He can't make Congress change the law (and
all indications are that Congress won't be able to do it because they're
too deadlocked).

So the best he can do is to get illegals with children out of the
country before the 20 days is up.

The current US law says that children cannot be detained for more than
20 days. So if an illegal who snuck across the border towing a kid
claims asylum (as the activists have coached them to do), they get
arrested pending a hearing by an immigration judge. If that delay takes
more than 20 days, the child must be moved to foster care, out of
detention. That's the law.

So either we release the illegal into the country and make them
pinky-swear to come back for their illegal immigration hearing (which is
what previous administrations did, allowing illegals of questionable
background into the country unfettered), or we relocate the child into
temporary care while the parent waits in a federal prison.

There is a third option: deport them faster.

This is the option Trump will be going for. He will find a way to make
deportations happen within 20 days to stay compliant with the law and to
keep families together. I suspect that he will make it policy that
illegals who claim asylum will simply be deported and told to come in
the front door not-illegally so that their family is never separated.
It's been a challenge when someone sneaks into the country illegally but
then claims asylum. That's the problem we need to fix quickly.

(EDIT) My prediction did not come true. Instead, Trump, unsurprisingly,
did exactly what he said he'd do, and signed an illegal Executive Order
actively defying the law and the court, allowing children to stay in
incarceration with their parents for more than 20 days. This is
definitely not the road I would have gone down, but someone is going to
have to challenge the Executive Order in order to change it. In today's
political climate, no one is going to challenge the Executive Order,
despite its illegality, because the optics of doing so are terrible.
