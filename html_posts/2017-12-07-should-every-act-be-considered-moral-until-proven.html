**Should every act be considered moral, until proven to be immoral? Or
should (can) an act be proven to be moral in absolute terms?**

The problem in modern society is the source of morality.

For religious people, the source of their morality is God. For
non-religious people, the ultimate source of their morality is
themselves. They infer their own morality.

Therefore, we can't make any absolute statements about actions and
morality, since we can all have our own morality. Clearly though, there
are some acts that we almost universally consider immoral. Beyond that,
we simply can't consider any particular act automatically moral or
immoral, because there is no moral standard across the whole of society.
