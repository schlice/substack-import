No.

Your job is to **love them**. I'm pretty sure Jesus said explicitly what
your job is.

That's it. That's your job. Love them. Nothing more, nothing less. When
we love, we display the love Christ has for us. God's love works
*through* us.

We are not to point at others and call them sinners, because every time
you point a finger at someone, three fingers point back at you (try it
and you'll see what I mean). We have no right to judge others, as we are
sinners ourselves.

We are to focus on our own journey. Let others focus on their own
journeys and make their own choices.

Unless they ask.

And if they *do* ask, I suggest you bring them to talk to a pastor.
Because that whole "fire and brimstone" approach you want to take is
very off-putting.
