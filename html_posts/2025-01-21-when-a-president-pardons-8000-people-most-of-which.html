Absolutely.

Don't believe me? [[Demorcats already said
so](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4c8e78&url=https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2025/01/21/adam_schiff_in_2020_presidents_dont_give_an_innocent_person_a_blanket_pardon.html){.external_link

Adam Schiff accepted a pardon for his actions while part of the January
6th Subcommittee.

But interestingly, just five years before, he said the following about
President Trump's pardons of his family (***emphasis*** mine):
