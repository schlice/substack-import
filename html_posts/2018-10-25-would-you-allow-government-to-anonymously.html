**Would you allow government to anonymously \"look\" through your emails
to prevent potential terrorism and other serious crimes?**

That's not the way our justice system works in the United States,
regardless of the altruism of your motive.

In this country, we have evidence of a crime **first**, and then we
obtain permission through the courts to "look" through emails. We don't
go fishing for evidence before we have it.

"Allowing" government to look through your emails is giving away your
rights without any reason. The government should be focusing on
gathering actual evidence of a crime, not going on fishing expeditions.
