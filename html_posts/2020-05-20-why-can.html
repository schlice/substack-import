**Why can\'t I set up my email on my phone?**

There are a couple of reasons why you may not be able to access your
email on your phone.

1.  You don't know how, or you're doing it wrong.
2.  Your email provider may not allow your phone to access your email.
3.  Your phone may be incapable of accessing email.

Not to worry though. Your phone carrier has a well trained customer
service group who can help you set up email on your phone. They may even
have some online tutorials you can walk through to do the same.

Alternatively, your email provider may also have directions for setting
up access to email on your particular device. You might check their help
section as well.
