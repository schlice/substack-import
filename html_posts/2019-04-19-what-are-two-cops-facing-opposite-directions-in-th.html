**What are two cops facing opposite directions in the middle of the
highway doing?**

Talking.

That's the only way you can get the two driver's side windows to come
together, otherwise one of them would be shouting through his car to the
other car.

When they face opposite directions, the driver's side windows are
together, and they can sit and talk as if they are sitting next to each
other.
