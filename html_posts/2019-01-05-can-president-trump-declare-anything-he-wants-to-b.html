**Can President Trump declare anything he wants to be a national
emergency to get funding and his way? Are there any limits to his power
in declaring a national emergency?**

Everyone here is correct, the President cannot spend money that has been
obligated somewhere else. This would be patently illegal.

However, if the President does declare a national emergency at the
border, he has another option. He can spend "un-obligated money" which
is present in the Department of Defense budget, because the law allows
the military to fund construction projects during war or emergencies.
Title 10 USC gives the military the authority to fund border barrier
projects under certain circumstances.

You can be certain that the President would face a legal challenge, as
has every step he has taken since the day he entered office. But if he
can justify his declaration of national emergency, it's likely that he
can use DoD money.
