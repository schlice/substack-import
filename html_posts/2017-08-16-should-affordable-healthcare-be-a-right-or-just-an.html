I am arguably someone who could benefit from free healthcare. The cost
of my healthcare is higher than most.

That said, I have to agree that **healthcare is not a right**.

Even if you decide on universal healthcare, you're not actually making
healthcare a "right." No one has a "right" to a commodity. For example,
look at the right to keep and bear arms. This doesn't mean you have the
"right" to a free gun. Because you have the right to free speech doesn't
mean the government gives you a free computer to connect to the Internet
for free. Just because we have a soup kitchen that provides free food
doesn't mean you have a "right" to food. We want you to have a house,
but the existence of the homeless shelter doesn't mean you have the
"right" to housing. These "rights" do not exist in the Constitution
because they are not "natural rights" which the government cannot take
away from you. They are commodities, which should rightly exist in the
free marketplace. Charity can assist the poor (and welfare is simply a
government-sponsored charity program), but charity does not solve
poverty. And before I get too far off-topic, that's a discussion for
another question.

Rights are not about giving you something for free. They are about
protecting natural liberties from entities which might seek to take them
away from you. A right to healthcare without charge (which would be the
only way it could be a "right," because if it's your right, you should
not have to pay to exercise it) means that someone else must labor for
free. That's called *slavery*, and we abolished that long ago.

Most people who talk about "free healthcare" tend to equate "free" with
"I don't pay at the time of service." But healthcare, like food or
shelter, is a commodity. One way or another, you do pay. And if it's
**government-run healthcare**, you pay through taxes. Let's not forget
that the places which have government-run healthcare have some of the
highest marginal tax rates in the known world.

But a "right?" No, healthcare is a service, not a right.
