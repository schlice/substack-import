**Given the recent mass shooting, is the government coming for my guns?
Should I bury them until it's safe to dig them up?**

No, not time to bury yet.

Wait for the 2nd Amendment to be repealed, along with the 5th and the
14th. Once those are all repealed, **then** it's time to bury your guns,
because then and only then will the government be legally permitted to
start coming door-to-door to confiscate all the guns they can find.
