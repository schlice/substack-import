Morals and ethics are relative. Unless we all share a common ultimate
moral authority (like God), which we do not, then each person's moral
authority is different, and therefore no one can be subject to the same
set of moral standards.

So rather than asking whether or not it is moral or ethical to do
something, let's ask whether or not it is ***legal***, and whether or
not it is ***appropriate*** for an able-bodied person to use a
handicapped restroom stall.

First off, there are no laws against able-bodied individuals using
handicapped stalls in restrooms, as far as I know.

This leaves us the question of appropriateness. Is it appropriate for an
able-bodied person to use the handicapped stall in a restroom?

The answer is yes. So long as there is not a wheelchair-bound individual
waiting for that stall, and if there aren't any other usable stalls
available, then it is appropriate to use the stall as you need. Do try
to do your business promptly and vacate the stall in case a
wheelchair-bound person is waiting, since that's pretty much the only
stall they can use. Please keep your Instagram and Facebook surfing and
your Flappy Bird playing to a minimum while you're in the handicapped
stall.
