The air rifle is absolutely quieter than the .22.

If your only concern is noise, go with the air rifle, but understand
that you\'re less likely to kill the pest every time; you may only wound
them, or just piss them off (most likely scare them away temporarily).

If you hope to kill the pests every time, the rimfire is the way to go.
38 grain copper-plated rimfire goes 1260 fps (and the slug itself is
heavier), so you\'re way more likely to kill with the rimfire than you
are with the air rifle.

My FIL uses an air rifle with a big-azz scope on it to scare off the
wolves from his land. He specifically doesn\'t want to kill them, so he
uses the air rifle with a scope at a lower air pressure to just piss
them off and hopefully scare them away. It does the trick pretty
effectively. He might wound them, but the air rifle doesn\'t kill them,
and this is at a distance of 50-150 yards.
