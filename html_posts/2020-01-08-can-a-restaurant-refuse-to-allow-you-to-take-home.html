**Can a restaurant refuse to allow you to take home the leftovers?**

Yes they can; however, they run into an issue with what food was paid
for. And we're not talking about buffets here, which clearly can post
signs saying eat as much as you want while you're here but you don't get
to take leftovers home.

If the restaurant serves the food to the customer, they cannot re-use
that food. Per health codes in the US, if it hits the customer's table,
it is spent. It cannot be re-used. So anything that doesn't get eaten
gets thrown away.

The issue arises if the customer wants to take the leftovers home (which
they've already paid for) and the restaurant refuses. In that
circumstance, the restaurant would need to pro-rate the meal based on
what portion the restaurant would rather throw away than allow the
customer to take. I'm not paying for \$20 worth of food and only getting
\$10 worth, and allowing the restaurant to throw away \$10 worth. If I
eat half of the meal and the restaurant doesn't allow me to take the
rest of it home, I won't pay for the half they wouldn't allow me to
keep.

The only exception would be if this policy were clearly posted somewhere
(no leftovers, no pro-rata) and it were clearly articulated and you
agreed before you ordered. I have never encountered a restaurant where
this was a thing.
