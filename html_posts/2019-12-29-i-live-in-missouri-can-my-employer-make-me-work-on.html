Yes your employer can make you work on your day off. However, if you
work more than 40 hours a week, you must be paid overtime. That\'s under
Federal law, not state law. There are some exceptions to the Federal
overtime law, but in general, this applies to everyone. For example,
some technical jobs are called *exempt* and are not covered by the
hourly requirements.

In Missouri, there is no minimum or maximum amount of time you can be
scheduled to work. Missouri follows Federal law when it comes to
employment and overtime.
