Because home values are not the only thing that homeowners are concerned
about. As others have said, homeowners are really only terribly
concerned about home values when they are planning on selling. They're
not overly concerned day-to-day with home values.

Homeowners like to keep their neighborhoods livable. Generally, this is
done through the use of restrictive covenants and rules/regulations
which govern home use, especially the exterior of the home. And also
generally, short term rental guests are not really concerned with
following the neighborhood rules. Short term rental guests are less
concerned with "pissing off the neighbors" because they don't live
there, they're just staying there temporarily. So it's not just the
NIMBY factor, it's the fact that short term rental guests do not
maintain the same pride of ownership as a permanent resident or
long-term renter. This means that home exteriors may suffer, and the
overall neighborhood aesthetic may change.

There's also the increase in traffic at a short-term rental, and the
fact that you never know who is in the neighborhood, a crucial part of
neighborhood security. Being able to identify an unknown vehicle in your
neighborhood would be important to neighborhood security; short term
rentals obviate the ability to do so.
