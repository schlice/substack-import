**Can I join the military if I was arrested for domestic violence? No
charges were pressed. It was just an overnight stay and I have no other
criminal history.**

The answer is a good solid "maybe."

The military has standards of "moral character" for enlistees. At a
minimum, they will perform a criminal background check, and your arrest
record will certainly be shown to them. Also the fact that you were not
charged and you were released will be shown (which works in your favor).
Even if you have a felony on your record, you can get a waiver to join
the military, so there's a fair chance that your one arrest (and
presumably, no further criminal record) won't immediately disqualify
you. You're going to be questioned about it, but like I said, if it was
one time and did not continue, you should be fine. Notice that it
disqualifies persons with *significant* criminal records. This means
that you will be evaluated on a case by case basis.

Here's what the military says about moral character:

> Persons entering the Armed Forces should be of good moral character.
> The underlying purpose of moral character enlistment standards is to
> minimize entrance of persons who are likely to become disciplinary
> cases or security risks or who disrupt good order, morale, and
> discipline. Moral standards of acceptability for service are designed
> to disqualify the following kinds of persons:
>
> - Individuals under any form of judicial restraint (bond, probation,
>   imprisonment, or parole).
> - Those with significant criminal records.
> - Persons convicted of felonies may request a waiver to permit their
>   enlistment. The waiver procedure is not automatic, and approval is
>   based on each individual case. One of the considerations in
>   determining whether a waiver will be granted is the individual\'s
>   ability to adjust successfully to civilian life for a period of time
>   following his or her release from judicial control.
> - In processing waiver requests, the Military Services shall require
>   information about the \"who, what, when, where, and why\" of the
>   offense in question; and a number of letters of recommendation
>   attesting to the applicant\'s character or suitability for
>   enlistment. Such letters must be from responsible community leaders
>   such as school officials, ministers, and law enforcement
>   officials.[\[1\]](#ZHBkk){#cite-ZHBkk .citation_link}
