**How do I hold this company accountable for gross slander and malicious
prosecution?**

Hire an attorney. It's really that simple. If you actually have a case,
your attorney will tell you.

Then you pay your attorney. They are not social justice warriors who
swoop in and right your wrongs because rainbows and kittens. They are
real people, working for a living. You'll need to pay them for their
trouble.

There's nothing on the internet that's going to hold anyone accountable
for anything without a lawyer. I mean, maybe you can stir up the
Twitterverse and get the blue check mob to fight on your behalf with a
well-crafted meme that goes viral or something, but that's a hollow
victory. Real accountability comes through the courts.
