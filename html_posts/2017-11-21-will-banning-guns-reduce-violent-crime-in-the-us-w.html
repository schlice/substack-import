I suppose if you're only worried about "gun violence," then logically if
there are fewer guns, there will be less gun violence.

But as has been clearly shown recently, you don't need a gun to be
violent. Criminals have used all sorts of tools to be violent, some of
which include box cutters, commercial airliners, trucks (on several
different occasions), cars, improvised explosive devices such as
pressure cookers, and of course, the oft-ignored knife which, much like
the gun, was originally invented as a killing tool.

The knife is an interesting case. It was originally a piece of sharpened
flint or obsidian, or possibly rock or bone. It was either used as a
stabbing hand weapon, or attached to the end of a long pike (at which
point it would usually be called a spear). However, with the advent of
metallurgy, we found that we could sharpen the side of the blade to a
much finer aspect, and the utility of the knife grew more as a cutting
and slicing tool than a stabbing weapon. However, this doesn't change
the fact that the knife is still an excellent stabbing weapon, as
evidenced by the number of stabbings worldwide, and also clearly
evidenced in places where strict gun laws exist (like in the UK), where
the leading weapon used in violent crime is the knife, and "hot
burglaries" (where the victim is home when the burglar enters) is **ten
times** higher in the UK than in the US. Hmm, I wonder if that has
anything to do with the fact that the burglars know that law-abiding
Britons won't have guns...

So if your goal is to make "gun violence" go down, then clearly yes, gun
violence would go down.

**But if you don't address the source of the violence, then other types
of violence will rise to take its place.**

You won't be shot, and I guess that's good. You can console yourself
with that knowledge when you get mowed down by a truck.

*I can remember his last words: "At least I wasn't shot..."*
