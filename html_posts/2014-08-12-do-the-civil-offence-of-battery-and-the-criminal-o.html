<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The crime of assault, in most jurisdictions, includes the<br>offense of battery, as the tort assault doesn\'t rise to the level of a<br>crime without the included battery. In some jurisdictions, the crime of<br>assault is actually called \"assault and battery.\"\<br>\<br>The tort \"assault\" and \"battery\" are still separate entities for<br>tort law and civil court. You can be assaulted without a battery taking<br>place (a verbal assault, for example). A \"battery\" in civil court<br>would be constituted as unwanted touching where that touch was<br>intentional. Generally, you can sue for assault and battery, but in most<br>cases, where the incident is both an assault and a battery, it is a<br>crime.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
