It\'s always okay to disclose your salary target to a recruiter.

It\'s ***NOBODY\'S BUSINESS BUT YOURS (and your accountant)*** what your
*current* salary is.

The bottom line is that **your current salary is not needed in order to
evaluate your suitability for employment.**

For any company, what good does it do you to judge your prospective
employee by what another company was paying them? What if they were
overpaying them? Worse, what if they were underpaying them?

When a recruiter asks your salary, you tell them that in this particular
job search, you are looking for positions paying in the \$120k range,
and you ask if this position is in that range. If it is, it makes sense
for you both to keep talking. If not, you can move on, no hard feelings.
Any recruiter worth his salt will be able to tell within 30 minutes of
talking to you whether or not you are a good candidate for the position
for which you are applying, and if your requested salary falls in the
range that the company is offering, all\'s the better.

Many companies do ask for your current salary, but as you know, that is
your private financial information, and at this early phase in the
hiring process, there is no reason that anyone needs to know your
private financial information. Just as the company does not share its
salary data with you, you are not under any obligation to share your
personal salary data with them. If the job in question pays in the
\$120k range, then you can keep talking. If not, then you can move on
with no hard feelings.

If the recruiter does not know the current salary range, you can safely
ignore that job. Why? Because the recruiter, or the company, is simply
not worth it. The days of \"employers make the rules, and job-seekers
follow the rules\" are over. You have worth! You have leverage in the
hiring process, or they wouldn\'t be talking to you in the first place.

Some recruiters may say, \"You\'re going to have to trust me if we\'re
going to work together.\" And that\'s fine, you shared your salary
target. If that\'s not sufficient, you should feel free to move on and
look at another company.
