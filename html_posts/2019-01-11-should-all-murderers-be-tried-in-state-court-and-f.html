**Should all murderers be tried in state court and federal court?
Wouldn\'t this be better for the offender so that they can do more time
if convicted of murder?**

If all you're trying to do is make longer sentences, why not just change
sentencing guidelines for murder rather than increasing the workload on
an already overburdened court system?
