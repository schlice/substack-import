The answer to any legal question is "it depends."

What kind of "friendly questions" were these? Did they want to know what
kind of music you like, or your favorite movie this year? Or did they
want to know whether or not you heard anything suspicious at your
neighbor's house last night? Or worse, where you were last night?

It really depends on the question.

Cops don't generally have the cycles to just randomly pop by someone's
house and ask random questions without a reason. They were likely
investigating an incident in the area and they were asking some general
questions to see if you needed to be investigated further.

You'll know soon enough whether or not you were selected for additional
screening.
