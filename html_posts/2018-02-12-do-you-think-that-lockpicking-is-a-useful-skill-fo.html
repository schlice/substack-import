**Do you think that lockpicking is a useful skill for a police
officer?**

No.

Lockpicking is a useful skill for a locksmith.

If a police officer needs to enter a locked room, he needs to have a
reason to do so (without someone unlocking the door for him). He might
be able to do so under what is known as **exigent circumstances.** If,
for example, he hears someone being beaten inside that room, entry into
that room is permitted under exigent circumstances, and the officer can
use whatever means necessary to enter that room. Picking the lock would
be too inefficient a use of time in such a case. He is better off
breaking a window and gaining entry that way, or breaking down the door
if need be (even though most main entry doors are fairly solid, and
breaking them down requires more force than a man can reasonably
achieve).

If an officer needs entry into a locked room, no one is available to
unlock the door, and exigent circumstances do not exist, he must get a
warrant to enter that room. Once he has warrant in hand, he has two
options: break the door, or hire a locksmith. But to be honest, if he
has enough time to get a warrant, he has enough time to get a locksmith.

Therefore, lockpicking is not a necessary skill for a police officer.

Additionally, an officer who does know lockpicking will always be
questioned as to whether or not entry into a locked room took place, and
whether or not searches were lawfully executed. Therefore, an officer
who knows lockpicking may be the subject of increased scrutiny.
Therefore, knowledge of lockpicking may be a *liability* instead of an
asset.
