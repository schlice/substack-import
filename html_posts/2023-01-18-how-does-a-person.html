**The more time you spend in the Word and in communion with Him, the
less likely you will be to sin.**

There really isn't a more complex way to put it. As you grow in your
faith, those desires for sinful acts will fade. It's not like a light
switch; they don't just turn off. But they do fade. The love of God
overpowers the lust for sin, every time. The process may be gradual, but
it is continuous. It's part of what we call *sanctification*, the
gradual process God uses to improve believers over time.

In other words, *Don't worry, it gets better.*
