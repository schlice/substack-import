**How does a State, with a strict anti-abortion law, like Missouri,
handle the following situation: a rape victim becomes pregnant. Is the
rapist liable for child support, as the father?**

Yes, because child support isn't about protecting the mother or
punishing the father (or the other way round, as the situation may be).

Child support is about supporting the child.

Since you made the child, and it can be proven that you are the
biological father, you are financially responsible for that child until
it turns 18.

If the mother chooses to keep it (and many rape victims do), the father
is responsible for child support.
