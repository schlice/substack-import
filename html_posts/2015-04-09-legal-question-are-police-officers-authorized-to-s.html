To answer your specific question, if a suspect is simply fleeing the
police but does not threaten anyone\'s safety (either the public or the
officer), then deadly force cannot be used. The recent case in South
Carolina shows the line which officers cannot cross. If an unarmed man
is not a threat to anyone, he cannot be shot.

If the suspect is a threat to the public or to the officer, deadly force
may be authorized. Any UOF will be reviewed in every case anyway.

The landmark Supreme Court case *Tennessee v. Garner* solidified use of
force: a police officer may not use deadly force against a fleeing
suspect unless \"the officer has probable cause to believe that the
suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury
to the officer or others.\" That's a pretty high bar to overcome, so in
practice, fleeing suspects can generally not be shot. The Court found
that use of deadly force to stop a fleeing suspect is an unreasonable
seizure under the Fourth Amendment, without probable cause that the
suspect posed a significant threat.

The only place in where this is different is on a US military
installation on which the installation commander has authorized the use
of deadly force. Those officers are indeed authorized to shoot you even
if you are not a threat to anyone. Simply fleeing from custody is
grounds to be shot if you are on a military installation. Military
police are allowed to shoot you if you are fleeing with classified
documents, fleeing with HE (high explosive) ordnance (or anything else
considered dangerous to the public), or simply fleeing from custody. If
you pose a threat to the installation or to anyone on it, you can also
be shot.
