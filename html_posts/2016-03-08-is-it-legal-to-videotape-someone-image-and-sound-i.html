Property owners are allowed to record nearly any activity that takes
place on their property. Property owners still must allow for privacy,
so generally recording people in bathrooms and bedrooms (where there is
a reasonable expectation of privacy even from the owner of the property)
is not allowed.

However the property owner has the right to record your actions on his
property in any and all shared spaces, with or without your consent.

You ***may*** have a claim if you signed a lease agreement and it does
not specify that shared spaces will be monitored. You would have to
consult with an attorney to see if you have a claim. I doubt you would,
as you would still have to show some harm was done before you could make
a claim.

But if you are just \"couch-surfing\" or staying in his house
temporarily without a lease agreement, you probably don\'t have much
standing for any sort of claim.

The only way you may have a claim is if he was publishing the video
online without your consent, or if he was obtaining private information
to use for his own gain (like listening to you speak a credit card
number over the phone and then stealing your credit).

If he was simply protecting his property through the use of a security
camera and he took care to safeguard the video, or the camera belonged
to a security company like ADT and the video was securely stored in
their cloud (as I have in my house), there\'s not much room for any sort
of claim.
