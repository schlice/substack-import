I've already answered a question similar to this, but unfortunately I
don't think they are similar enough to merge:

[[Bill Stein\'s answer to Can I legally refuse to be pulled over if I
suspect (on reasonable grounds) he was a \'fake\' police
officer?](https://www.quora.com/Can-I-legally-refuse-to-be-pulled-over-if-I-suspect-on-reasonable-grounds-he-was-a-fake-police-officer/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container}

Let me re-iterate the salient points:

1.  There is no legal provision in any state I know of that allows you
    to refuse to pull over, regardless of your reasoning. That means if
    you refuse to pull over, you can be charged with failing to stop.
    Any reason you may have for not stopping would be considered a
    defense to that charge.
2.  When you are illuminated by a car which you believe is not a real
    police officer, your first course of action would be to immediately
    get out your cell phone and call 911. Inform the dispatcher that
    there is a car behind you with red and blue lights but it doesn't
    look like a police officer. They will be able to tell you if it is a
    real police officer behind you. If the dispatcher tells you it is a
    real police officer, **you must stop immediately.** It's not up to
    you to determine whether or not the location is "safe" to stop. It's
    up to the officer to keep you safe during your traffic stop. There's
    no provision in the law to "second-guess" the officer's judgement on
    the location for the traffic stop. If you stop somewhere and
    something bad happens, it's on the officer, not on you.
3.  If you cannot call 911 because you don't have a cell phone or is not
    working, your only other viable option is to drive (safely, do not
    speed) to the nearest police station, and go inside. Tell the desk
    officer that there is a car following you and you are unsure whether
    or not it is a police officer. If it is, the officer will come
    inside and you will sort it all out together. If not, the car will
    likely drive away and you will be safe.

Failing to stop for any length of time beyond making a phone call to 911
is ill-advised.
