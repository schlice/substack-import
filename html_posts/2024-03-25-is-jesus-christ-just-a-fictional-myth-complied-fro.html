What evidence would you accept?

In order to determine what evidence you will accept, I will ask you your
question, but will change one thing. Here you go:

> ***Is Alexander the Great just a fictional myth complied from others
> and the surroundings? Provide evidence!***

So how would *you* answer that question? What evidence would you provide
that *you* would be satisfied with? I'm certain you will be able to
produce satisfactory evidence proving Alexander the Great actually
existed.

Now ask yourself: ***Why is that same evidence insufficient for Jesus
but it is sufficient for historical figures like Tiberius Caesar, Julius
Caesar, and Alexander the Great?***

I would also submit to you that *the amount of evidence which proves the
existence of Jesus of Nazareth is* ***greater*** *than the amount of
evidence we have proving the existence of Tiberius Caesar and Alexander
the Great.*
