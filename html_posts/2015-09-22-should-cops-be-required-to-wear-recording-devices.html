bios would be awesome, as this question intersects my civilian job at
EMC Corporation, and my passion for law enforcement)*\

[[Bryce
Christensen](https://www.quora.com/profile/Bryce-Christensen-1)]{.qlink_container}
has got it nailed.\
\
I would love to see every cop with a full time recording device (which
he can switch off in privacy situations), or a recording device which he
can switch on and off at will, and then be held accountable when he
doesn\'t record something he was supposed to. The problem, as Bryce so
aptly pointed out, is not the camera. It\'s the storage of the video.\
\
It\'s actually not as complex as he made it seem; every incident is
recorded separately, so every incident can be tagged with a video, and
since the reports are electronic, it\'s a simple matter to \"attach\" a
video to a report. The problem is the storage of this massive amount of
data. Departments simply don\'t have the funding to buy the increased
amount of storage.\
\
With the increase in storage, you will need an increase in the number
and complexity of your IT staff. You will need storage specialists on
your IT staff who are trained in the configuration and the
administration of large-scale enterprise storage systems.\
\
So not only do you need more money to buy more storage, but you\'ll need
more money to hire more IT staff, and apparently while everyone wants to
see every cop with a camera, no one wants to pay more in taxes to hire
more IT people or buy more storage.\
\
So while we\'d all like to see it happen, it\'s not very likely to
happen in the near future.]{.rendered_qtext}
