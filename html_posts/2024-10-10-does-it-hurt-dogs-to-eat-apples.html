Yes! It is safe for dogs to eat apples, **except for the apple core with
its seeds. Dogs should not eat apple seeds.** The seeds contain
amygdalin, which releases cyanide when chewed and digested. While
swallowing a couple of seeds is unlikely to cause problems, it\'s best
to be cautious.

Again, **do not feed whole apples to your dog**. Remove the core and
slice the apple before feeding to your dog. You can cut up apples into
chunks for easy chewing and to avoid choking, or you could feed your dog
applesauce if you choose to peel and stew your apples with a little
water.
