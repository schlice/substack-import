**Can you take an unlocked phone to any carrier?**

No. You can take an unlocked phone to any carrier *who supports that
phone's operating bands.*

If you want to ensure that your unlocked phone will work on your new
carrier, your best bet is to find out [[what wireless technology your
unlocked phone is
using](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cc0ae2&url=https://www.gsmarena.com/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"

support that
frequency](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1c8915&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_wireless_communications_service_providers%23Technologies_used){.external_link

carriers if you can use your unlocked device on their network.
