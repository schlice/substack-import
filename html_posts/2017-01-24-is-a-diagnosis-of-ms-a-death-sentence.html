***Absolutely positively not.***

Let's get this out of the way right now: **MS is not fatal**. You cannot
die from MS. You *can* die from complications surrounding MS, but you
cannot die from MS. In fact, for someone who has been actively managing
the disease with one of the approved MS therapy drugs, lifespans roughly
match that of people without MS.

MS changes the quality of your life. The approved MS therapy drugs can
improve your quality of life, almost to the point that MS may be a
non-issue.

For me, it's always in the back of my mind, but not to such a degree
that it prevents me from living my life. My plans have to include my MS.
Beyond that, I live my life normally.
