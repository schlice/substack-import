**How do I file a lawsuit against a city police agency for unlawful
practice, unlawful arrest, and unlawful search?**

Hire a civil rights attorney in your area. Police can be sued for
violating your civil rights. If you were charged with a crime, you can
ask the court to exclude any evidence gathered during the unlawful
arrest.

You can also file a complaint with the police department. Your lawyer
can help you do that, and having a lawyer help you makes the complaint
process worlds easier.
