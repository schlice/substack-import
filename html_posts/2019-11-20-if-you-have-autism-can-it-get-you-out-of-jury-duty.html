**Can autism disqualify someone from jury duty or not?**

Not automatically, but autism, as a disability, can be the basis for
disqualification.

Since every person on the spectrum is different, each case must be
addressed individually. If someone is so affected by autism that they
cannot speak and who needs caregivers to assist them with daily life
activities, they would most likely be excused from jury duty. But there
are plenty of people who have mild autism, like Asperger's, who are
perfectly capable of serving on a jury.

Check with the clerk's office where you have been summoned to jury duty
to inquire about being excused from duty due to disability. All of the
courts have different procedures for this.
