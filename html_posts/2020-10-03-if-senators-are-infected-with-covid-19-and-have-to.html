**Can Democratic senators get themselves infected with Covid-19 so that
they can enter quarantine and thus delay the vote to confirm a Supreme
Court justice?**

Nope. Nothing requires 100% attendance before a vote is taken.

The rule about which we are talking is regarding ***quorum***. What
constitutes a quorum of Senators? How do we know we have one?

The Constitution states that "a Majority of each \[House\] shall
constitute a quorum to do business\.... " That means that in order to
have a quorum, we have to have 51 Senators present out of 100 to cast
votes.

But how do we know we have a quorum, and when do we count? [[Senate
rules](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5c1415&url=https://www.senate.gov/CRSpubs/577d2a5e-2b47-4045-95fa-a76398e41461.pdf){.external_link

this topic. They state: "\[T\]he Senate presumes that it is complying
with the Constitution. Therefore, it presumes that a quorum always is
present unless and until the absence of a quorum is suggested or
demonstrated." So unless a Senator "suggests the absence of a quorum,"
the Senate presumes it has one. If a Senator makes such a suggestion
(which can be done so long as no other Senator has the floor), the
presiding officer can direct the clerk to call the roll. Once the clerk
calls the first name, the calling of the roll does not stop until either
quorum is determined, or "unless the Senate agrees by unanimous consent
to 'dispense with further proceedings under the quorum call.' While the
quorum call is in progress, no debate or motion is in order, nor may the
Senate act on any unanimous consent request except a request to dispense
with the call."

So sometimes, the suggestion of absence of quorum is used as a "brief
delay tactic" so that Senators may discuss a policy disagreement or a
procedural question, not necessarily because they believe that there are
fewer than 51 Senators present.

**TL;DR: You don't need 100 Senators to conduct business. The Senate has
a quorum of Senators when 51 are present to vote.**
