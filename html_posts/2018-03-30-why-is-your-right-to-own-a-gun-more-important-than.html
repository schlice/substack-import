**Why is your right to own a gun more important than my right to life?**

False dichotomy, or the logical fallacy of the excluded middle. The
question makes an either/or argument (either you have a right to own a
gun, or I have a right to life) and focuses only on the extremes. There
is a vast continuum between my right to own a gun and your right to
life.

In a comparison, in order for one to be more important than the other,
one must impact the other in some meaningful way. And as most of the
answers here have shown, my right to own a gun does not impact your
right to life. At. All.

The **only** time where the two rights might come into conflict is if
you use your right to life to attempt to remove my right to life, in
which case your right to life is forfeit. Then my right to own a gun may
be used to defend my life against your attempt to deprive me of my life.
