**Does Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick\'s idea about reducing the
number of entrances and exits in schools to prevent school shootings
have merit?**

He may have misspoken slightly, but he's absolutely right. We need to
limit the number of entrances into schools, and we need to limit the use
of all of the other doors. All of them. Make one teacher entrance
controlled by key fob or entry card. Other than that, all other
entrances are secured.

How many entrances and exits are there to the county courthouse (which
he also mentioned)?

There's one entrance you can use. The rest are there, but you can't use
them.

Of course, there are other exits, but have you ever heard of a **fire
door**?

Turn all other doors except for the main entrance and the secured
teacher entrance into **alarmed** fire doors. Post security guards at
the two doors.

This is really not difficult, people.
