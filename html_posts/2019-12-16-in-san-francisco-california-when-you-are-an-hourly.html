**In San Francisco, California, when you are an hourly employee and you
are off work, is it legal for your employer to send you text messages
and ask you work related questions? If not, how do you report them?**

In any state in the country, the Fair Labor Standards Act prevents
employees from working off the clock. It is illegal for your employer to
make you work (and work is anything you do for the company, including
text messages) when you're not on the clock.

Some of the suggestions mentioned here are good ones, such as when your
employer sends you a text message, responding immediately back to your
employer with, "I'm on the clock, right?" If it's email, set an OOO
every time you clock out that says that you are off work and you will
respond once you're back on work.

Remember that you can file with the US Department of Labor to recoup all
the back pay for all of the hours your employer made you work off the
clock. If it is significant, I would definitely file to get that money
back.
