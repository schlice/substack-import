**Why is it when I download an app to my cell phone or any cell phone it
doesn\'t have even a quarter of the features that that app would have on
my PC, it\'s like an extremely limited useless version?**

The fact that you're recognizing that there is a difference between a PC
version and a mobile version illustrates the problem we have of taking a
PC-based app and porting it to a mobile phone rather than designing a
mobile experience from the ground up.

Your phone is a computer. It's just a smaller, less-powerful computer.
It can't do nearly as much as your PC can do. Therefore, in order to
make the app actually functional on your tiny handheld PC, the app
designers have to make some, er, *trade-offs*. Will we structure this
page to look exactly as the PC app does, or do we have to trim some
stuff to what is barely needed in a mobile experience? Can we do some
remote processing and backend crunching in order to move the workload
off of the phone and into the cloud?

If the app starts off its existence as a mobile-designed app, you don't
notice any trade-offs, because it always was a mobile app.
