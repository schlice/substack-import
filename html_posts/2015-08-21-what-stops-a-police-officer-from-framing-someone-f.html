You don\'t have to be a cop to do any of the things you said. Bad people
do this all the time, and far more often than cops.

The only thing that prevents people from doing the things that you
mentioned is a conscience. Lose that conscience, and everything in life
becomes an exercise in moral relativity.

But if you're asking if there are anything preventing a police officer
from doing any of this, the answer is that there is nothing specific.
The same laws that prevent anyone from doing these things also prevent
police officers from doing these things. Basically, police officers are
not unique in this regard.

What makes police officers different here is that they have a great deal
of experience with these types of cases. They know how to "game the
system" and do the worst to you with the least likely backlash against
themselves. And it is true that the qualities which make a person a good
police officer also make a person a good criminal. The only difference
between the two is the moral strength of the person in question.

In other words, there is nothing structurally in place to prevent a
police officer specifically from doing any of these things. It's up to
police departments to hire people with good strong moral character to
prevent these types of abuses from taking place.
