Says who? Christian faith is not belief *without* evidence. Faith
bridges the gap between the *undeniable* and the *unknowable*.

For example, we know that the universe was created, because it had a
beginning, and if it had a beginning, it had a cause (see the Law of
Causality).

If you're a non-Christian, you might say that cause is *nothing.* Random
chance. But Christians believe that the cause is *something*, and that
cause is what we refer to as "God."

Faith bridges that gap between what we know (the universe had a cause)
and what we can never know with certainty (God created the universe).

But just because we can't know it with certainty, is that reason to
disbelieve it?

Which is more likely: *nothing created something*, or *something created
something?*

It takes less faith to believe something created something than to
believe nothing created something.

So while the Christian and the non-Christian both have faith, the
non-Christian has to have more faith to believe that nothing created
something.

\

Faith is not unique to Christians. Everyone has faith. The difference is
not that we have faith, it's *where we place our faith.*
