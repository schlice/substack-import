**What kind of democracy allows stimulus cheque's to have Donald Trump's
name on them! Using government money to campaign should be illegal in a
democracy! As a Canadian I find this horrible abuse of power what do
Americans think?**

The US Department of the Treasury is an Executive branch agency.

Trump is the head of the Executive Branch.

Trump can put whatever he wants on the checks. If he wants to put
unicorns and fluffy clouds on them, he can do that.

Instead, up in the corner, the check indicates "Economic Impact Payment"
and underneath that, it says "President of the United States Donald J.
Trump"

If the president is campaigning by simply printing his title and his
name, we're in deep trouble as a country.
