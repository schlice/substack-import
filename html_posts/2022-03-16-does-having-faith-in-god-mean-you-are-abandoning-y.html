I see this sort of question all the time. People have the fundamental
misunderstanding that *religion* is the opposite of *science*. Like, for
some reason, you have to throw out the scientific method in order to
have faith in a god. In actuality, this isn't *religion vs. science.*
It's *good science vs. bad science*.

Faith is not an absence of logic. Faith is belief in the facts that you
have. We all have faith. Even the atheists have faith that their
conclusions are correct.

Science is really a search for causes. So when we're answering the most
important scientific question around: **why are we here**, we are trying
to find our *cause*. What caused us? We know that the *something* which
caused us must be eternal, what we call the First Cause. Because if the
thing that caused us had a cause itself, then it is not the First Cause
(i.e. something caused *it*). There seem to be two possible answers to
that question: either an eternal universe caused us to come into
existence through random chemical interactions, or some other eternal
creator outside of the universe caused us to come into being.

Our analysis of the existing data shows us overwhelmingly that the
universe could not have been the cause of humanity coming into
existence. There are a variety of proofs we use to determine this (and
if you're interested, I can point you to some really great resources
which discuss these proofs) such as the Law of Causality and some other
proofs as well which show conclusively that the universe had a
beginning, and thus a cause, therefore it could not be our creator. But
this leaves us with only one other option: some other eternal creator
outside of the universe caused us to come into being.

And wouldn't you know it, the God of the Bible happens to fit the
attributes of such a creator perfectly. But that's a different
discussion, for another day.

**TL;DR**: In actuality, belief in an eternal creator is very logical
and is highly informed by science, reason, inference, and the scientific
method.
