No, the two are unrelated.

You still have to pay late fees if you are late on a dues or a fine
payment.

If the HOA failed to *even attempt* to have an annual meeting, you can
sue the HOA for violating state law. Usually though, they don't "fail"
to have a meeting, because the bylaws usually state that they have to
"attempt" to have a meeting, which means they have to send out meeting
notices and proxy forms to homeowners, who have the option of
participating or not. In many cases, they don't.

If the Board doesn't have enough attendance (both in-person and by
proxy) to lawfully hold an annual meeting with the percentage of
homeowners required in the bylaws, then they cannot hold an annual
meeting. Whether or not they try again, and how many times they try, is
also dependent on your individual governing documents.

So it could happen that no annual meeting takes place, but it is
perfectly legal.
