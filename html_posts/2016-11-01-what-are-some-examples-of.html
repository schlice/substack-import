OK, you're looking at someone with one.

[[Multiple
Sclerosis](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=042d09&url=http://www.nationalmssociety.org/What-is-MS){.external_link

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container} is an
[[**autoimmune
disease**](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0466d2&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_disease){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} in which the immune
system mistakes the myelin sheath surrounding nerve fibers of the
central nervous system as invading organisms and attacks and destroys
them. This process is known as *demyelination.* What's left in place of
the myelin are "scleroses" or scars. That's where the name comes from:
multiple sclerosis, "many scars." Nerve signals do not travel as well
through these areas of demyelination, which produces the various
symptoms of MS: fatigue, nerve pain, balance/coordination, gait,
bowel/bladder dysfunction, memory and cognition issues, and a whole
range of other symptoms. No two people experience MS in exactly the same
way, but there are some symptoms which are more common than others.

In most cases, people with MS show no outward sign of disability. I've
lost count of the number of times that someone has incredulously looked
at me and said, "You have MS? But you look so *good!"* I often want to
retort, "Well, how exactly is someone with MS *supposed* to look?" The
one time I did, they responded, "Well, I thought everyone with MS is in
a wheelchair, or walks with a cane, or something."

It's true, it is a common misconception that everyone with MS has some
form of visible disability. In fact, most people with MS will not show
any outward signs of the disease for many years. It's the great Ironic
Disease: how good you look on the outside has absolutely no relation to
how bad you feel on the inside.

**tl;dr: Multiple Sclerosis, for the most part, is an invisible
disease.**
