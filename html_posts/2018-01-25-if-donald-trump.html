**If Donald Trump's wife upset him, he might have had sex with a hooker.
If someone did not like Trump, would this be a beneficial scandal to
promote?**

I am steering WAY clear of the trap of trying to get into whether or not
this actually happened, or whether or not he allegedly did it because
"his wife upset him."

Let's just focus on the last part instead.

**If someone did not like Trump, would this be a beneficial scandal to
promote?**

In order to "promote" this "scandal," you have to hope your target
audience has a very short memory. It was just a few years ago that Bill
Clinton was having sex in the Oval Office, and then lied about the whole
thing. The House passed impeachment charges, but the Senate didn't think
enough of those charges to remove him from office.

So the message we heard from Washington was, "We know what you did, we
know you lied about it, but you can still be President."

Fast-forward to today. We already know what kind of a man Trump is. He's
a pussy grabber. Access Hollywood made sure we knew that, loud and
clear.

Here's the thing though: we knew about all of this before the election,
and we (collectively) elected Trump anyway.

So will this be a beneficial scandal to promote? I doubt it:

- Most of America (in fact, nearly everyone who voted for Trump), will
  probably just shrug. "We already knew he was a pig, so having an
  affair is like, 'meh, I could see him do that.'"
- Others will be relieved that it was a consensual relationship and not
  a sexual assault scandal as is being highlighted by the #metoo
  movement. So long as Trump doesn't plan on lecturing me about what a
  healthy marriage should look like, what happens between him and the
  First Lady should stay between him and the First Lady, unless they
  want to talk about it (and I'm not pushing them to do that).
- Democrats would probably want to stay far away from this, because they
  would have to own up to the double-standard of supporting Clinton's
  antics in the Oval Office while simultaneously deriding Trump for
  doing the same thing. They would also have to answer to what Hillary
  did as part of Bimbo Eruptions, destroying the women who had affairs
  with her husband to discredit them, and explain how attacking the
  women involved with her husband was okay while deriding Trump's
  behavior.
- Liberals will have to cope with the liberal media publishing stories
  saying that [[it's essentially okay for your spouse to have
  extramarital
  affairs](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=35ead0&url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/25/health/cuckolding-sex-kerner/index.html){.external_link

  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
  qt-tooltip="cnn.com"}]{.qlink_container}. By the way, that story was
  published today, 25 Jan 2018.

So is this beneficial? I don't really think so.
