**Does the Samsung Galaxy S8 support a 5G network?**

No.

You will have to purchase a 5G-capable phone, which contains the correct
network adapters to communicate with a 5G network, in order to operate
on a 5G network.

This isn't something that can be "updated" via a "software fix." This
requires a completely different radio, and a different modem. You will
have to purchase a phone which can operate on a 5G network in order to
utilize 5G technology.
