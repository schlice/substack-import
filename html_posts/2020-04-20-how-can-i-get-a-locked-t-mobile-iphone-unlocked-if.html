**How can I get a locked T-Mobile iPhone unlocked if I'm not the
original owner?**

You will have to contact T-Mobile. You will have to give them the IMEI
of the device (you can get it by typing **\*#06#** on the phone keypad)
and you will also have to provide them with the bill of sale showing
that you are now the rightful owner of the device (and that you didn't
find it or steal it).
