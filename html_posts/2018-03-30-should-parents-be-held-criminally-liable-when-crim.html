I\'m going to buck the trend, I guess.

**No one should ever be held criminally responsible other than the
criminal, and anyone else who commits the crime with them, for
committing a crime.**

If your area has safe storage laws, parents can be held responsible if
they fail to follow those.

Parents might also be held liable for a neglect charge, or something
similar.

But holding a party criminally responsible when they did not participate
in, know about, or otherwise knowingly facilitate the crime in question?
No.

If you want such a law, first you have to pass safe storage laws (and
deal with the Constitutional issues around that) and then make it a
crime to violate that law. Then you can charge them with reckless
endangerment or something like that, too.
