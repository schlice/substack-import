I can answer half of your question: I don't know enough about land use
theory and its application to rural and suburban crime, but I know about
the broken windows theory. This theory spawned the "Compstat" initiative
in New York City, and when it spread across the nation, resulted in the
longest and largest decline in felony crime in this nation's history ---
well over two decades of decline.

Brittanica has this definition of "broken windows theory" which was
originally written by James Q. Wilson and George Kelling in 1982. They
start by examining traditional crime prevention methods, which focus the
most resources on the most serious crimes.

The "broken windows theory" was directly tested in an urban setting by
Police Commissioner William Bratton in the 90's in New York City.

Between 1990 and 1992, when Bratton was chief of the New York City
Transit Police, he implemented "broken windows theory" policing in the
city subways. He stationed plainclothes transit officers at turnstiles
to catch turnstile jumpers. As arrests for misdemeanors went up, subway
crimes of all kinds decreased dramatically.

In 1994, Bratton was promoted to Police Commissioner, and applied the
same theory which worked so well in the subway to the entire department,
calling it the "quality of life initiative." He began cracking down on
panhandling, unsolicited windshield washing, D&D (drunk and disorderly),
and prostitution. When he retired in 1996, homicide was down 50%, and
felonies in general were down almost 40%.

Bratton's system, which tracks smaller crimes to reduce bigger ones, is
called "Computer Statistics," or "Compstat." Compstat was so successful
in New York City that it has been exported and employed in police
departments across the country, and has resulted in the longest and
largest decline of serious crime in this nation's history. Before
Bratton started his program in 1993, there were 1946 murders in New York
City. In 2015, there were 352.
