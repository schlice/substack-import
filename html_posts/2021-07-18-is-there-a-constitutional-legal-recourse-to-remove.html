First, let's get something out of the way right now.

- The states certified their elections.
- The Congress certified the results of the state elections.
- The president was sworn in lawfully, and power was transferred.

Therefore, **the president was Constitutionally elected.** Nothing about
the process by which he assumed power was unconstitutional.

THAT SAID, if these audits find that there was significant fraud in a
state election, so significant that *it would have changed the outcome
of that state's election,* we're going to take a very strong look at
what failed in that state to allow an election to be corrupted in such a
way. And the big question to the states from the Congressional
subcommittees which do the investigations will be: *How could you
possibly have certified an election with so much fraud taking place?
What are you going to do to fix it?*

Remember the 2000 election? Bush v. Gore? Two words: **hanging chads**.
Florida got a *huge* black eye over that one, and they fixed their
voting laws. 2020 was a very smooth election in Florida because of those
voting law changes. States which changed their voting laws through
emergency orders (due to COVID) instead of lawfully through legislative
action are going to get a very stern look and a mandate to fix their
voting laws before the next presidential election.

Except that some states, in trying to do just that, are being
disingenuously attacked for "limiting" voting rights, when the things
that they are "limiting" were only put in place as emergency executive
orders.

Anyway, the only way that Biden leaves office is if he actually knew or
participated in any of the fraud which took place in any of the states.
If this evidence ever comes to light, he can be impeached and removed
from office.

If not, and it still comes to light that there was such significant
state fraud that it could have changed the course of the election, then
the Biden presidency will be indelibly marred by the stigma of being a
president who was very likely not the people's true choice. This has
been true of other presidents in history, and it would be true again.
Any mandates he thought he had would be questioned even more strongly
than they are now, and the Biden legacy will be reduced to a footnote in
the pages of history.

Is there a Constitutional, legal recourse to remove Joe Biden from the
presidency IF it is proven through auditing processes, that he is not
the legitimate winner of the 2020 election, since an illegitimate
president is not Constitutional?
