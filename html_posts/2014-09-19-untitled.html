<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [The mere presence of weapons in the hands of the people is
enough to make the government, or anyone who seeks to deprive someone of
their God-given rights, think twice before they do so. Because it\'s not
a matter of how good my weapons are compared to theirs. It\'s a matter
of my mere possession that gives them pause. They cannot take my rights
without a fight. I have rights and I will defend those rights to the
death.\
\
The government exists to serve the people, not the other way around. If
we allowed the government to arm to such a degree that we cannot
overthrow a corrupt government, shame on us. Can the federal government
become corrupt to the point that it ignores the very rule of law that
placed it there in the first place? As soon as it does, it loses its
legitimacy, and the state government takes over.\
\
And ultimately, the people are the government.]{.rendered_qtext}
