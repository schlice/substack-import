<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [The mere presence of weapons in the hands of the people is<br>enough to make the government, or anyone who seeks to deprive someone of<br>their God-given rights, think twice before they do so. Because it\'s not<br>a matter of how good my weapons are compared to theirs. It\'s a matter<br>of my mere possession that gives them pause. They cannot take my rights<br>without a fight. I have rights and I will defend those rights to the<br>death.\<br>\<br>The government exists to serve the people, not the other way around. If<br>we allowed the government to arm to such a degree that we cannot<br>overthrow a corrupt government, shame on us. Can the federal government<br>become corrupt to the point that it ignores the very rule of law that<br>placed it there in the first place? As soon as it does, it loses its<br>legitimacy, and the state government takes over.\<br>\<br>And ultimately, the people are the government.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Is-the-2nd-Amendment-outdated-Is-it-necessary/answer/Chris-Craddock<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
