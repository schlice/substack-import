These are **fourteen books** that come in what we call the
intertestamental period between the Old Testament and the New Testament.
They are indeed recognized as canonical in the Roman Catholic Church,
but Protestants do not recognize them as canonical.

But how did we get here? Let me give you a brief history about how the
various Bibles came about in their current forms.

By the (roughly) 3rd century before Jesus, Greek was the most common
language. Hebrew had become sort of a "specialist language." The Torah
was in Hebrew, but most of the Jewish community at that time could not
read Hebrew. It was mostly the religious scholars and the rabbis who
could. And much like modern-day believers who wanted the Bible
translated into English (or German, or French), there was a strong
movement at the time to translate the Scriptures into a common language
that the people could understand. To that end, the Scriptures were
translated into Greek, a translation known as the **Septuagint** (in
Roman Numerals, LXX). It is what most people of that time understood by
"the Scriptures."

When the Roman Catholic Church canonized their Bible, they simply
accepted those Jewish scriptures without comment. They then translated
the entirety of their canonized scriptures into Latin, a translation
known as the **Vulgate**.

This is how things stood in the church until the Protestant Reformation.
Having rejected the authority of the Roman Catholic Church, Protestants
focused church authority in the Bible. But which Bible should they use?
Since Protestants decided that all things Roman Catholic were hereby
"bad," that meant that the Vulgate was out.

Thankfully, as it turns out, the Jewish community had their own
"revival" movement in about the ninth century, and produced the
"Masoretic Text," all in Hebrew. But there were some books in the LXX
which had always been in Greek, never in Hebrew. The books we now call
the Apocrypha *were too new to have originally been in Hebrew,* so the
Masoretic Text rejected them. Those reformers did not consider them as
part of the Torah. This version became the standard text of what the
Jews understood as Holy Scripture.

When Protestants canonized *their* Bible, they simply did exactly what
the Roman Catholic church did in the 4th century, and used the Scripture
that the Jews were using as canon. The Masoretic Texts were used as the
starting point for the Bible, not the Septuagint, and since the
Masoretic Texts excluded the books written only in Greek, so too did the
Protestant Bible.

In essence, both the Roman Catholics and the Protestants accepted as
"gospel" what the Jews of their time accepted as "gospel." It simply
resulted in two different groups of books, because the Jews reformed
their own Scriptures in the intervening period.

*(Note that there is a lot of history I am leaving out here. I am not
claiming this to be an authoritative reading of history. It simply is
enough to provide some background as to how the various versions of the
Bible were assembled, and what happened to the apocrypha. There is* much
more *to the story than just this, but this is a basic outline.)*
