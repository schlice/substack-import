**Why was private security fired after the 9/11/01 attacks when the box
cutters used were perfectly legal and they couldn\'t do anything if they
found the boxcutters?**

Security supplied by the airlines wasn't fired. Their business was shut
down (or that segment of their business was made no longer relevant in
airports in the US), and the vast majority of them were hired by TSA.
