**Content:** [Like [[Charles
Evans](https://www.quora.com/profile/Charles-Evans-14)]{.qlink_container}
said, it really depends on what your definition of \"common sense\" gun
control is.\
\
Libertarians fundamentally believe that all individuals are soverign
over their own lives, and \"no one should be forced to sacrifice his or
her values for the benefit of others.\"\

I think this says it all. Libertarians believe guns are not the problem.
Put the responsibility on the owner and user of the gun, not on the gun
itself. A gun is an inanimate object and by itself can\'t cause any harm
without an owner or a user interacting with it. Do not focus on the gun,
focus on the user of the gun. If someone has a gun and they hurt no one
with it, they have not committed a crime and they should not face any
penalty. But if someone commits a crime with a gun, the most severe
penalties available should be imposed.
