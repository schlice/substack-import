I think that if SCOTUS does decide to rule on this, it will come down on
the President's side.

First of all, Twitter is a private service. You do not have a 1st
Amendment right to be heard on Twitter. You don't even have a 1st
Amendment right to use Twitter in any way, because it is a private
service. Twitter can ban you from the service, and individual users can
block you. You don't have any 1st Amendment claim when it comes to using
a private service because it's really hard to argue that Twitter is akin
to a forum like a town hall, which is physically constrained. I think
the courts would hesitate to make such a claim, as it would put an undue
and Constitutionally-unsupportable position on private communications
platforms. Remember, the 1st Amendment was designed to prevent the
government from taking action against you for your speech, not to
guarantee you open access to private communications services. Twitter,
for all its openness, is still a private company offering a private
service.

Secondly, Trump has two accounts: \@realDonaldTrump, and \@POTUS. The
first is a private account, controlled by Trump himself, which he
arguably uses on his own, without any White House oversight. The second
is the official Twitter account of the President, controlled by the
White House, where all tweets are logged and all activity is officially
sanctioned and monitored. Trump blocked the individuals from his
personal account, not the POTUS account. Trump, as an American citizen,
has the right to use Twitter in the way it was intended. If this case
goes to the plaintiffs, then you are claiming that you lose your own 1st
Amendment rights when you become president, and that you essentially
lose control over your private interaction with a private company.
Remember, this is not about the public POTUS account, just about Trump's
personal account. Trump still remains an American citizen, even if he is
president. He does not lose any of his own 1st Amendment rights simply
by becoming president.
