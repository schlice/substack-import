**Content:** [Calmly. Understand that the initial approach to the
vehicle is the most tense for an officer. Here\'s a few good ideas for
you to follow:\
\
1. If it\'s not cold or raining outside, try to roll your window down.
If it\'s nighttime, try to turn on your interior lights.\
\
2. Put your car in park. When an automatic transmission is moved from D
to P, it has to go through R. This makes your reverse lights blink. This
is an indication to the officer that you\'ve placed your car into park.
Not seeing this and continually seeing brake lights usually indicates
that the car is still in D, and causes the officer to suspect you are
going to try a \"drive-off\". Don\'t do this, because it just puts the
officer(s) on edge.\
\
3. Be respectful. Being rude can only help to exacerbate the situation,
and can only make things go worse for you.\
\
4. Be honest. If you know you were speeding, say so. If you lie, or if
you say \"There is no way I was speeding,\" they\'ll simply give you the
ticket anyway because their RADAR/LIDAR unit clearly captured your
speed. If you fess up, some cops would be less likely to give you a
ticket. If you have a clean driving record, you may end up with a
warning.\
\
5. Try to keep your hands on your steering wheel. If the cop asks you to
get your registration, you should say, \"It\'s in the glove box, can I
get it now?\" rather than just reaching for it.]{.rendered_qtext}
