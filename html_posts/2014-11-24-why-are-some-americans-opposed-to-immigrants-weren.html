**Content:** [I don\'t know why Americans would be opposed to
immigrants. My grandparents were immigrants.\
\
I, however, as an American, am opposed to ***[ILLEGAL]{.underline}***
immigrants. Notice that I bolded, italicized, and underlined a missing
word from the question.\
\
Millions of Americans have come to this country and been naturalized
(i.e. made a citizen through a process overseen by the USCIS (US Customs
and Immigration Service). It is a long process, sometimes taking years
to complete. This is an issue. The administration needs to fix this. It
is fixable. We can improve the immigration system.\
\
However, millions of immigrants have **[chosen]{.underline}** to
***violate the law*** and come into this country ***ILLEGALLY***,
bypassing the immigration process and remaining in this country as
\"undocumented aliens.\" Notice that there are also \"documented
aliens,\" such as people who came into this country on a temporary visa
and then simply decided to stay beyond the length of their visa. THESE
are the immigrants I have a problem with.\
\
If your first act as a \"citizen\" of a new country is to ***VIOLATE THE
LAWS OF THAT COUNTRY***, I have a problem with your continued residence
in this country.]{.rendered_qtext}
