**Content:** [Narcolepsy is one of the major sleep disorders in which
the brain cannot adequately regulate sleep cycles. Narcolepsy is a
neurologic disorder, not an illness, and the course of the disease is
similar to the course of multiple sclerosis, except that the issues
within the brain causing narcolepsy originate from a different source
than MS. Narcolepsy is generally caused by gene mutations or other brain
abnormalities, where MS brain issues are caused by autoimmune damage to
nerve cells.\
\
However, it is not a stretch to see how damage to the brain caused by MS
could potentially cause sleep apnea or other associated sleep disorders,
should MS lesions occur on the brain stem. Sleep is a major issue for MS
patients, as fatigue (or MS lassitude) is one of the most prevalent
symptoms of the disease. MS patients also face restless leg syndrome
(RLS), which is a major disruptor to normal sleep cycles.\
\
There is a weak causation between multiple sclerosis and obstructive
sleep apnea. [[A 2014

\
While there is no direct causational link between multiple sclerosis and
narcolepsy, it is not difficult to see how a MS patient could easily
develop major sleep disorders and have a predisposition to obstructive
sleep apneas and other central apneas if their MS includes lesions on
the brain stem.
