There are two questions here, so we'll answer them individually:

> ***Did security checks at the airport start after the 9/11 attacks?***

No, security was in place at airports before 9/11. However, airport
security was administered primarily by the airlines. The argument after
9/11 was made that a national agency needed to set and maintain
standards on all US airlines, so the Transportation Security
Administration was formed as a department under the newly-formed
Department of Homeland Security, and all US airport security was placed
under Federal control.

> ***Why did they start after the 9/11 attacks when the hijackers
> didn\'t fly from an airport?***

We know from the first question that there was airport security before
9/11. But this part of the question says that the hijackers "didn't fly
from an airport," which is not true. All 19 of the hijackers boarded
their aircraft at major airports: Logan, Washington Dulles, and Newark.
