When you are stopped by the police, it is illegal to lie about your
identity.

You can lie to the police at any other time you choose (at your own
peril, of course), but you may not lie about your identity. This is a
separate charge in and of itself (obstruction of justice, or obstruction
of the duties of a peace officer, or barring justice, depending on
jurisdiction), but you can be jailed until the police can establish your
identity.

The reason for this falls under [[Scott

answer, that it is illegal to lie to a government official. For the
police, this clause only applies to your identity.
