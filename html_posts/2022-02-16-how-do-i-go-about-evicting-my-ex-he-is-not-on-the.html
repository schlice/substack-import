Laws regarding apartment rentals and tenancy vary wildly between states,
so you'll have to check your state's laws on who is considered to be a
tenant and after how long.

So you said he is your "ex." It makes a difference whether he is your
"ex-husband" or your "ex-boyfriend." Usually, a tenant is someone who is
on the lease, or who is related to you. In general, a tenant cannot
allow anyone to stay in the apartment *unless they are on the lease, or
are immediate family or transient family or friends.*

If it's an "ex-boyfriend," he's *probably* not considered a tenant. But
if he has stayed there for more than two weeks out of any six-month
period, most states consider him a tenant.

The reason why I am asking if he is a tenant is that if he is, he gets
tenant's rights, and needs to be formally evicted before he can be
removed from the apartment.

What's more, if you ever accepted rent payments from him, you may have
inadvertently created a landlord/tenant agreement with him, making him
automatically a tenant and giving him tenant's rights.

If he is not a tenant but a guest, he can be removed at any time. You
can call the sheriff to have them assist with his removal. You are under
no obligation to keep his stuff in your apartment; you can throw it
outside of your door and it would be up to him to figure out how to get
that stuff somewhere.

But usually, this all works out better if you are reasonable,
considering that you are at the complete legal advantage here. Give him
a timeframe to get out. Give him 30 days (or 60 days if you're feeling
generous) to find a new place to live and get his stuff out. If he isn't
out by the date you've given him, and he simply refuses to leave,
contact the sheriff's office to assist you with removing him physically,
and then get some friends together to move his stuff outside.

If he is a tenant, you will have to go through a more formal eviction
process to get him out, and it will require the court's assistance. In
that case, you'd probably be best served by engaging a real estate
attorney in your area who specializes in apartments and rental law.

Original question:

How do I go about evicting my ex? He is not on the lease, but has no
car, so he has effectively trapped himself here because all his crap is
here. What should I do about his stuff. I cannot afford to pay for a
moving truck or rental. HE HAS TO GO.
