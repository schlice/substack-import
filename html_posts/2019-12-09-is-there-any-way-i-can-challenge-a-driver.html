**Is there any way I can challenge a driver\'s license suspension for
refusal to submit to chemical testing? Not having my license is
affecting my ability to get work in my field.**

Unless the refusal was because of some reasonable excuse, it's unlikely
you will be able to challenge the suspension.

When you agreed to get a driver's license, you also agreed to be subject
to the state's rules about driver's licenses, which includes submitting
to chemical testing. The rules include the fact that if you fail to
submit to testing, your license will be automatically suspended. You
agreed to this when you got your license. What changed now? Why is it
now okay for you to refuse chemical testing, when it was okay when you
got your license in the first place?

As I said, without some extraordinary circumstance or reasonable excuse,
it's unlikely that the court would find the suspension unreasonable.
