That's the fundamental operation of belief in a belief system. If you
believe *your* religion, by default, you necessarily believe that
*other* religions are not true.

It also indicates that all these religions believe *contradictory
things*. In other words, religions generally don't all believe the same
thing. The idea that Americans hold that "all religions essentially
believe the same things" is gibberish. While most religions have a
similar moral code, nearly all religions disagree on every major issue:
the nature of God, the nature of man, sin, salvation, heaven, hell, and
creation.

Why is it with over 10,000 religions in the world, everyone who is a
part of any of these 10,000 religions, is 100% sure, their belief system
is the right one?
