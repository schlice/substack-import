Yes.

The process for changing your name varies by state, but to get a name
change outside of a marriage or a divorce, you will generally be
required to file a petition with the court.

The court will check a few things before granting your petition. They
will make sure that, for example, you are not changing your name to
avoid prosecution, or to avoid creditors. They'll also make sure that
you're not changing your name to the name of a famous person in order to
mislead people, or changing your name to a racial slur or a name which
includes "fighting words."

If the court approves your petition, they will enter a decree with your
new name.

You can then use the decree to get a new Social Security card, a new
driver's license, and with all three of those, you can correct your name
everywhere else it is recorded (mortgage, credit cards, etc).

But the bottom line is that if you want to legally change your name to
Lucifer or Iblis, you should talk to a lawyer in your area to ensure
that your name is legally valid.
