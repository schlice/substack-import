Your therapist, as a matter of practice, is bound by doctor-patient
privilege. He is only obligated to report you to authorities if he
reasonably believes that you may be a danger to yourself or to others.

However, let's stop for a second. How did you get to your therapist's
office? I hope you took the bus, because if you drove your car, that's
DUI. If your therapist believes you might be a danger driving yourself
home, he can call the police, and that is not covered under
doctor-patient privilege.

I think he would probably spend more time talking to you about the fact
that you are stoned in the first place than looking for ways to report
you for being stoned in public.

I'd cancel my appointment and take the penalty for doing it within 24
hours if I wasn't bright enough to control my weed habit to such a
degree that I could make my appointments without being stoned.
