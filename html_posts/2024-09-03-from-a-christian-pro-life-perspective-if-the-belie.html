This question is an example of the logical fallacy known as a **false
equivalence**.

Comparing Jesus' sinless life to a fetus in the womb is incorrect. Jesus
was created sinless; fetuses in the womb are created with original
(imputed) sin.

Secondly, pro-choice people do not care that fetuses are not guilty of
any crime deserving of the death penalty, because *they believe the life
of the fetus is less valuable than the life of the mother*, full stop.
Therefore, they readily and easily discard the life of the fetus in
accordance with the whims and wishes of the mother.

The issue in abortion is not one of **sin**. The issue in abortion is
one of **equal rights.** Pro-life people believe in equal rights;
pro-choice people do not.
