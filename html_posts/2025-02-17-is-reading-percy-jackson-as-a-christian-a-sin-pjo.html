Christian here. And I loved the Percy Jackson series. I read the books
and watched the movie.

**You can watch it, and you can read the books, but you must do so
carefully.**

Just remember that it is all *fantasy.* None of it is an accurate
reflection of the world we live in. It certainly *seems* plausible, but
it is not. And movie magic makes it *feel* real, but again, it is all
fantasy, contrived by people.

The truth of God's kingdom is much different.

So long as you can tell the difference, enjoy the books and the movies.
Just remember it's all a story.
