Any question like this gets answered primarily with "it depends." It
depends on the load the person was shot with, the composition of that
load, the power behind that load, distance away from the shooter the
victim was, and where the shots landed. Yes, people shot multiple times
can indeed survive. The chances are all dependent:

- All rounds will cause more damage at closer range, as they still
  retain much of their forward velocity. Rounds will slow down as they
  fly (somewhat), so will necessarily be less able to inflict serious
  damage at greater distances.
- Larger (heavier) rounds will cause more impact trauma than lighter
  rounds.
- Fully-jacketed rounds will cause less trauma than unjacketed rounds.
  The metal jacket on a bullet will prevent the bullet from deforming
  quite as much as it hits soft tissue, so it will pass completely
  through soft tissue and out the other side (i.e. a "through and
  through"). Softer, unjacketed rounds will deform as they hit soft
  tissue and make a much larger wound cavity, which leads to more
  potential injury and more possibility for the victim to die.
- Hollowpoint rounds will also deform more than fully-formed or jacketed
  rounds, again releasing more energy into the victim rather than
  retaining that energy in the bullet and passing clean through the
  body. This results in a larger wound cavity and a greater possibility
  that the victim will die.
- Rounds which land on extremeties are less likely to cause death than
  rounds which land in the center mass of the victim. That said, anyone
  who can get shot in the arm with a .50 BMG and not die is a superhero.
  Besides the fact that the arm would be instantly vaporized and turn
  into nothing more than red mist, the impact trauma alone would kill
  you, even if you're shot in the arm or the leg.

The .50 BMG is on the far left. That's a big bullet. The M-16 (or AR-15)
fires the 5.56 NATO cartridge (second from the right). My M-4 carbine
also fires .223 Remington, which is not pictured but is very similar to
the 5.56.
