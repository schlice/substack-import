The Tetragrammaton is the literal 4 letter word for the name of God from
the Torah. Transliterated, it comes out to be YHWH, which is most
closely pronounced "Yahweh," even though the Hebrew letters are
unpronounceable. Some sects transliterate it to YHVH, which would be
pronounced "Yehovah," or Americanized as "Jehovah."

Oirginal question:

Doesn\'t the name Yahweh sound like ancient Egyptian stuff as opposed to
the God of Gods?
