The Second Amendment does not specify weapon types. Laws would do that,
not the Constitution. The Second Amendment specifies what types of laws
government ***cannot*** write, namely any law that might infringe on a
citizen's right to keep and bear arms.

So to answer your question, no weapons are covered, nor are any weapons
not covered, by the Second Amendment. Only government is affected by the
Second Amendment, being specifically prevented from passing laws which
might restrict a citizen from keeping or bearing arms.

> **Am I guaranteed the right to own and use an RPG?**

The answer is, as with all legal questions, it depends.

Since the Second Amendment does not address any specific weapons
platform, there is nothing in the Constitution which guarantees you the
right to own any particular weapon. State law does that. And there are
some pretty stringent state laws when it comes to certain weapons types
(namely, anything covered in the National Firearms Act, colloquially
called "NFA weapons," under which your RPG would qualify). Most states
regulate, but not prohibit, NFA weapons. Many states require special
permits to own them. Some states require permits from the chief of
police or the sheriff where you live, and not all of those are "shall
issue" permits.

And in case you were wondering, using an RPG against a person is just as
illegal as using a gun against a person. Murder is still illegal
everywhere in the United States.
