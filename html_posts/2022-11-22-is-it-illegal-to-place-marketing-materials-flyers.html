Mailboxes are not controlled by the HOA, but by the US Postal Service.

And they have quite a bit to say about placing marketing materials
inside mailboxes. Section 508.3. 1.3 of the Domestic Mail Manual (DMM)
states the following:

> *No part of a mail receptacle may be used to deliver any matter not
> bearing postage, including items or matter placed upon, supported by,
> attached to, hung from, or inserted into a mail receptacle.*

So you can rest assured that you won't face the wrath of the HOA. You'll
instead be visited by a Postal Inspector.

It's also important to note that while it is illegal to put anything on
to or inside a *mailbox*, it is not similarly illegal to put anything in
a *mail slot*. So if individual homes have mail slots, placing flyers in
those is not illegal.
