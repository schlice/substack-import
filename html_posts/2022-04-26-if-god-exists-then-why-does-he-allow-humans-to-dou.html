Because God has given us the greatest gift of all (besides his son,
which was a pretty great gift): *free will*.

Free will is that ability to question everything, even the existence of
God. The ability to make choices, *even the ability to reject truth*, is
what makes us moral creatures, and allows us to choose our own destiny.

God has given us the choice to either accept or reject him. And in order
to make sure that our choice is **truly free**, he has placed us in a
world filled with evidence of his existence, *but without his direct
presence*, which would be so overwhelming and powerful as to override
our free will and force us to believe in him.

In other words, *God has given us enough evidence to convince anyone
willing to believe, but has left enough ambiguity so as to not compel
the unwilling.*

In this way, God gives us the choice to love him or reject him, without
violating our free will. Because if we would truly love him, that love
must be freely given; it cannot be coerced.

**TL;DR: If God didn't allow us to doubt him, we wouldn't truly have
free will.**
