No. They should be held to the same standard as anyone else with a
firearm. Either change the standards for everyone, or change them for no
one.

There is nothing special about a police officer's firearms that
distinguishes them from the firearms of any other citizen. Even their
rifles which may even be fully automatic, are not firearms which cannot
be owned by any civilian (at great cost, but still possible).

Everyone needs to practice good firearms safety at home, and the level
of security within the home needs to be tailored to the people in that
home who have access to those firearms.

Nothing special here for police officers.
