**Is it an impeachable offense to knowingly try to artificially create a
National Emergency, even if there is a process to stop you?**

There really isn't a definition of what constitutes an impeachable
offense. The Constitution says "high crimes and misdemeanors," but
that's not a specific legal definition.

When Gerald R. Ford was in the House, he said that "an impeachable
offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers
it to be at a given moment in history."

Therefore, if a majority of the House believes that the President is
abusing the national emergency power, they can indeed file articles of
impeachment.
