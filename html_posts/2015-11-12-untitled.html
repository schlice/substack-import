<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [Wow, I must work for one really freakin awesome
organization, because while we do have a few bad seeds, the good ones
don\'t put up with that crap. We have enough to deal with as it is. We
don\'t need to be putting our own careers on the line to cover for Joe
Schmuckatelli who can\'t get his crap together and is eventually going
to end up getting one of us killed.\
\
I find \"tons of bad ones\" to be anecdotal, and a terrible
misrepresentation of police around the country.]{.rendered_qtext}
