**How good is the Google Pixel 2 when compared to a similar iPhone or
Samsung device?**

There are two areas we can compare where it really makes a difference:
the camera, and the OS. There are other areas of comparison as well, but
I think the camera is probably the most noticeable difference.

**Camera**

As far as the *hardware* is concerned, the Galaxy S9 and the iPhone X
have better specs. The cameras are most definitely better quality, and
both the S9 and the iPhone X sport dual-camera setups for better
portrait mode support (the S9+ actually has a *physical variable
apeture* for better low-light shots).

Now, that said, the image processing software on the Pixel 2 is *second
to none.* Period. Full stop. Despite only having a single lens, the
Pixel 2 takes better actual pictures every single time.

In multiple side-by-side comparisons (you can find them all on YouTube),
the Pixel 2's image processing software handily beat all comers in the
vast majority of shooting scenarios. And in practice, you simply *cannot
take a bad picture* with the Pixel 2.

My oldest sold his S9+ and bought a Pixel 2 XL specifically for the
camera. He took it with him to Coachella and his pics actually looked
better than the pictures from his friend's DSLR.

If you're looking for the best camera hardware on the market, the S9+ is
the way to go. But if you want the *best pictures*, you cannot beat the
Pixel 2. Hands down.

**OS**

The ever-present iOS vs Android debate will rage on until one of the
platforms officially dies. For now, that doesn't seem like it's going to
happen anytime soon. Basically, pick the one you like. There are
advantages and disadvantages to both.

The Pixel has, arguably, the most *stock* Android experience of any
commercial phone out there, as there are virtually no overlays on top of
Android O. And Google will patch its Pixel phones *first* before any
other manufacturer, as the hardware developer and the carrier must all
test Google's updates with their hardware and network. So Pixel phones
will get Android updates before any other manufacturer.

However, TouchWiz has really *de-bloated* in the S9 experience. Granted,
Samsung still has its suite of apps (some of which may actually be
useful), but it has gotten much *closer* to stock Android than ever
before. And that's a very good thing.

Nevertheless, on Android, if you don't like TouchWiz or the stock
Android experience, you can always add your own custom launcher and go
crazy.

**Other**

Samsung phones still have expandable memory, while the Pixel and the
iPhone do not.

The iPhone X has completely removed the fingerprint sensor, relying only
on Face ID, while both the Pixel and the Samsung phones retain it,
albeit on the back.

The Pixel has a squeeze interface. The Samsung has the oft-maligned
Bixby button. The iPhone has neither of these "features."
