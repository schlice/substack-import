**Content:** [\<DISCLAIMER\> I think what has been happening to Jon is
terrible. I have come to the inevitable conclusion that people suck.
There\'s so many people that are just so stupid, it frightens me for the
future of our society. My reply is in no way intended to discount or to
disregard anything that Jon has said.\
\</DISCLAIMER\>\
\
I want to clarify a little for everyone\'s benefit. We all tend to throw
around the term \"racism\" very easily, but I think we should be
cautious in using the term. Rory Young\'s answer above is a prime
example of racism: a class system in which a ruling class and a subclass
exist, and the subservience of the subclass is ingrained in the laws and
culture of all the people. Someone who believes in racism believes that
the ruling class is genetically, socially, and racially superior to the
subservient class. It is possible that there were racist ideals that
drove the people with whom Jon interacted, but we cannot be sure.
\"Race\" itself is a fuzzy term; there is no scientific definition of
race. In the taxonomic structure, \"race\" is non-existent. The only
humanoid life on earth is the species \"homo sapiens,\" so
scientifically speaking, we are all part of the \"human race.\" Starting
in roughly the 1700s, \"race\" had started to be used to denote
differences in ethnicity, and so when we say someone is of a \"different
race,\" this generally means that they have different ethnic origins.
For the purposes of this discussion, we will use the term \"race\" in
the colloquial sense defining sub-species by ethnicity. It is more
likely that Jon was a victim of prejudice and bigotry than racism.\
\
Prejudice is the act of \"pre-judging\" someone based on limited,
superficial information such as race, ethnicity, sex, religious
affiliation, etc. Believe it or not, we all are guilty of one form or
another of prejudice. Not all prejudice is malicious, the vast majority
is not hateful. Pre-judging allows the human mind to \"fill in the
gaps\" when unknowns exist. Humans do not like uncertainty; the mind
will use what limited information it has and judge whether or not a
threat exists. It is a natural human defense mechanism. Prejudice allows
the mind to execute the \"fight-or-flight\" protocol. For example, when
looking at a creature, the brain asks \"Is that creature a threat?\" It
then uses the characteristics of the creature, which includes previous
encounters with the creature, propensity of the creature\'s species
towards violence, the current state of agitation of the creature, etc,
to determine whether or not the creature is a threat. It then makes the
\"fight or flight\" decision based on that. The prejudice that Jon
experienced, however, is hateful. People can, and do, prejudge based on
race.\
\
Bigotry is a narrow-minded, intolerant life perspective that doesn\'t
allow someone to see things from someone else\'s point-of-view. Like
prejudice, bigotry can be about things that have nothing to do with
race, such as sex, sexual orientation, or religion. Bigotry also
includes intolerance for the views or opinions of the bigoted person.
The bigotry that Jon experienced is clearly based on ethnicity.\
\
So we know that he experienced prejudice and bigotry. He likely did not
experience racism because, in the United States anyway, we have
de-institutionalized any racist practices which used to be in place
(i.e. Dred Scott). So we don\'t have a culture or a structure of racism
in this country, but prejudice and bigotry will always exist. It is up
to us to understand why they exist, and to curb or eliminate them
whenever we can. The best way to do that is through knowledge.\
\
Which is why I hate stupid people. So I would say that yes, I am bigoted
against stupid people. I need to work on that.]{.rendered_qtext}
