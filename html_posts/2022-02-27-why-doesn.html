Certainly sounds logical. If God knows all (omnipotent), why do we have
to pray? He already knows what we need! Why doesn't he just give us
everything that he knows we need?

There are a few reasons why.

1.  God doesn't give us what *we* need. God gives us what *he wants us
    to have.*
2.  God knows exactly what you desire, but he wants to hear from you
    anyway.

There is a very big misunderstanding about prayer. Prayer is thought to
be this sort of "vending machine" relationship: we say the prayer and
the gift pops out of the little door at the bottom. And if we *don't*
get what we prayed for, then God must not exist, or if he does, he's
unloving.

But this is a fundamental misunderstanding about why God is gracious to
us, and what effect prayer has.

God doesn't give us things *because we asked for them*. God gives us
things *because it's part of his plan.* If we get something which we
asked for in prayer, it's because God already wanted you to have that
something, because having that something is part of his plan. God
doesn't abandon his plan for you because you asked for something in
prayer. If that prayer comports with his plan, then he will give you
what you asked for. So just know that if you prayed for something and
you didn't get it, it's because that thing is not part of God's plan for
you.

I'm learning that winning the Powerball is not part of God's plan for
me. I'll still ask, and God knows my heart and knows that I'd certainly
be a good steward of that money, but that's just not part of his plan
for me. I'm also learning that he won't remove this thorn from my side
(MS) just because I asked, because having MS is part of his plan for me.
As he said, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made
perfect in weakness." (2 Cor 12)

And while God already knows what he wants you to have, he doesn't always
just give it to you, *because God created you for* ***relationship****.*
This is one of the reasons that the pandemic was so mentally trying on
people. We were created for togetherness. We were created for
relationship. And God desires nothing more than for you to love him and
be in relationship with him. *That's* what he wants. He wants to express
his love to you through his relationship. He wants to know you *in the
way you see your life!* He wants you to talk to him! He wants you to
tell him about your day. He wants you to tell him what was good, what
was bad, how you're feeling, what you're thinking; again, even though he
already knows.

Why doesn\'t God just give us what we need if he knows we need them?
