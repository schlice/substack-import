Our human bodies are flawed. They are sinful. They desire to do what is
easy, expedient, and pleasurable, not what is pleasing to God. In other
words, left to our own devices, we would live in sin constantly, because
that's what our bodies tell us they want. It's *easy* to sin. It's
*easy* to ignore God and how he wants you to live.

Our feelings can easily lead us astray. The Bible even tells us to be on
guard and not trust our feelings.

> He who trusts in his own heart is a fool, but he who walks in wisdom
> will be saved. --- Proverbs 28:26 KJV
>
> The way of fools seems right to them, but the wise listen to advice.
> --- Proverbs 12:15

Feelings are not evil *per se*, but they could lead us easily into
sinful behavior, and even into ignoring God.

Feelings are a good indicator of what's going on inside of us, and yours
are indicating that there is a struggle in you. Your feelings should
inform you of what's going on inside you, but God never intended your
feelings to ***lead*** you. That's his job. He wants that job; he never
intended your feelings to control you.

Living by faith means letting God lead you, not your emotions. Instead
of focusing on your feelings, focus on what you *know* is right:

> Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble,
> whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is
> admirable---if anything is excellent or praiseworthy---think about
> such things. --- Phillipians 4:8 NIV

Feelings are a *gauge*, not a *guide*. Live by *faith*, not by feelings.

> So do not fear, for I am with you;\
> do not be dismayed, for I am your God.\
> I will strengthen you and help you;\
> I will uphold you with my righteous right hand. --- Isaiah 41:10 NIV

Emotions are powerful, and can be amazing and terrifying. But living in
faith means understanding the source of our emotions, and not allowing
them to control us.

Original question:

**When I hear about god my body is like (yeah yeah god yuh) as if my
body dislike\'s him or doesn\'t care. I try to be like God is good and
loving but my body\'s feelings is just negative towards him. I\'m very
concerned?**
