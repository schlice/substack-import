Hopefully, it doesn't take a Christian to review the actual data. Even
non-Christians should be able to see that using a single data point to
make policy usually results in bad policy.

So let's flesh out the numbers and then you can much more easily see *if
anything* needs to be done, and if so, *what*.

Yes, it is true that in 2020, the CDC reported that firearms became the
leading cause of death in children and adolescents, surpassing
automobile accidents for the first time ever.[\[1\]](#xwuYE){#cite-xwuYE

But there are some details that this single data point leaves out.

First, we must understand that the CDC identifies "children" as people
between ages 1 and 19. So let's not forget that we are defining 19-year
olds as "children." Remember, we consider them adults at 18, so they're
including two years worth of adults in their figures. Keep a 19-year old
gangbanger in your mind when the CDC says "children."

Next, we must understand that the number includes self-inflicted gunshot
wounds, suicides being the largest percentage of the firearms deaths in
that CDC number. And when it comes to suicide, we must remember that
this was 2020. During the *pandemic.* When suicide rates among children
increased by 10% over the year prior.[\[2\]](#rNZWX){#cite-rNZWX

The point we're making here is that a singular data point doesn't tell
us *why* that data point is how it is. Just saying that firearms-related
homicides increased more than automobile accidents in one year doesn't
explain why that is happening.

\

I'm not really going to speak to it, but I wanted to acknowledge your
unsubstantiated assertion that Christians are somehow "fine" with
children dying. Please tell us where you got this information so that we
can review it. I can't seem to find it anywhere.
