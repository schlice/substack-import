**If Rush Limbaugh invited you to a posh restaurant for a nice dinner,
all expenses paid by him, would you accept and be there?**

Yep.

And even if your question read "Barack Obama" instead of "Rush
Limbaugh," I'd still be there.

I don't have to agree with someone's policies in order to enjoy a nice
dinner at a posh restaurant, especially when someone else is paying.

In either case, we'd have lots to talk about.
