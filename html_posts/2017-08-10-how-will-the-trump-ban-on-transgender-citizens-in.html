So this is mostly a misstatement in the question causing a lot of
confusion.

First, **Trump is not banning transgendered people.** Trump is reversing
an Obama-era policy which would have allowed transgendered people to
openly serve on Active Duty and in the Reserves. However, Obama gave the
military services a year to implement the policy, and the policy was
still in the planning stages; it was never implemented. Trump is
reversing Obama's reversal of an original transgender ban which has been
in place for as long as we've had a military.

That said, what will happen to transgendered individuals in the military
is **nothing at all.** The only difference: they will not be allowed to
"come out" as transgender. They will have to continue serving in exactly
the same way they are serving today. They will not be allowed to wear
the uniform that matches their gender identity; they will have to
continue wearing the uniform that matches their biological sex. They
will not be able to get gender reassignment surgery paid for by the
military. If they have already "come out" as transgender but have not
received surgery, my guess is that they will be allowed to remain under
the current rules. If they choose to continue to serve under those
conditions, they certainly can. If they haven't "come out" yet, and they
decide to come out after Trump's reversal takes effect, they will be
honorably discharged after they come out.

The policy will "keep the door closed" to new transgendered individuals
joining the military, but since the question didn't discuss new
recruits, we will stick to what will happen to existing transgendered
troops.
