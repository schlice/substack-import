It's not a system of *fairness*. It's a system of *justice*.

Did your friend who became a felon simply because he had no money to pay
child support try to work with the court and/or opposing counsel to work
out a payment plan? Or did he claim IFC (indigence for costs)? Did he
declare bankruptcy?

If he did not do any of these things, then it's likely that he still had
the ability to pay, but chose not to. Did he have a \$1000 cell phone in
his pocket? Probably. Did he own a car? Probably. Did he have enough
money to pay for rent? Maybe. But it's likely he has money, but he's
spending it in the wrong places.

He probably didn't claim IFC because he's not indigent. If he would have
claimed indigence, he would have not become a felon. You can't get blood
from a turnip; if you truly have no money, you can file for bankruptcy
or claim IFC and you won't be charged with felony failure to pay child
support.

Is it *fair*? No, it definitely is not fair. But is is *just*? The court
seems to think so.

THAT SAID, I still support non-violent felons not losing their 2nd
Amendment rights. We paint too broad a brush when we say that all felons
lose their 2nd Amendment rights.
