Because abortion advocates think they're talking about this

:::: ui_qtext_image_outer
::: qtext_image_wrapper
![](images/qimg-17d9943b311bdc1aa6f54c637e4cfe06){.landscape
.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed
master_src="images/qimg-17d9943b311bdc1aa6f54c637e4cfe06" master_w="400"
master_h="400"}

When in reality Ted Cruz and pro-life advocates mean this:

:::: ui_qtext_image_outer
::: qtext_image_wrapper
![](images/qimg-c7f2aa1f7efb591f3f029b855f8861c6){.landscape
.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed
master_src="images/qimg-c7f2aa1f7efb591f3f029b855f8861c6"
master_w="1000" master_h="1000"}

It's simple, really. There are two lives involved in abortion, not one.

It is whether people believe the small life in the second picture is a
life or not that is the one and only difference between the pro-life and
pro-choice advocates. That's it, nothing else. It's not about
controlling women or being anti-choice or anything else you can concoct.
This is it.

Original question:

How can it be that Sen Ted Cruz (R) TX who has used the hashtag, \"your
body, your choice\" referring to the COVID 19 vaccine, yet he doesn\'t
have that same opinion for Pro Choice advocates who have long used that
very saying, \" YBYC\" themselves?
