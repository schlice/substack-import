**If we used the same standard for Trump\'s impeachment, should other
living former Presidents have been impeached?**

If we apply the standards of this impeachment to ***every other
presidency in history***, then any president could have been impeached
for abuse of power and obstructing Congress. Every president has
committed these impeachable offenses.

What's interesting will be what happens to Democrat presidents under a
Republican House as we move forward, using these new standards for
impeachment.
