**Can I go to USAFA and then become a USMC fighter pilot?**

Short answer: yes.

Longer answer: There are a certain number of "cross-commissions" that
take place between the service academies at graduation. Maybe you
weren't able to get an acceptance at the academy of your choice. Maybe
some other circumstance made you change your mind after you started at
your academy. Regardless, cross-commissioning is a thing.

It is a one-for-one swap; only an equal number of people may accept a
commission in the opposite service. For example, if there are twenty
USAFA grads who want to accept a Navy commission (and work in the Marine
Corps), but there are only ten USNA grads who want to accept a USAF
commission, then only the top 10 USAFA grads would be able to
cross-commission.

Becoming a USMC pilot after that is up to the Marines.
