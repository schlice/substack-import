**Did Trump even see Pelosi put out her hand? He didn\'t shake with the
VP.**

Your point is well-made. You would think that if it was an intentional
snub, he would have shaken Pence's hand to prove the point.

But it's okay, she jabbed right back when she broke protocol and
improperly introduced him. Traditionally, the House Speaker introduces
the president by saying "Members of Congress, I have the high privilege
and distinct honor of presenting to you the President of the United
States." Instead, she just said "Members of Congress, the President of
the United States."

So in the game of one-upsmanship, did anyone really win here?

Thomas Sowell said, "How are children supposed to learn to act like
adults, when so much of what they see on television shows adults acting
like children?"

Acting like children, indeed.
