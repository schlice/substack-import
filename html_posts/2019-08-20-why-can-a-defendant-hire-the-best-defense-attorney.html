**Why can a defendant hire the best defense attorney he can possibly
afford, but the plaintiff basically gets a public prosecutor basically a
public defender, something every defendant dreads?**

Sounds like you're talking about criminal cases. And in a criminal case,
who is the "plaintiff?"

The answer: **the state**. The crime victim is not the plaintiff. So the
state does not become the victim's "public prosecutor" because the
victim is not the plaintiff. The people as a whole are the plaintiff.
The people are represented by the District Attorney's office.

In a civil matter, each party represents themselves, or has an attorney
to represent them (depending on the size of the claim). Under a certain
dollar amount, parties represent themselves in *small claims* court.
