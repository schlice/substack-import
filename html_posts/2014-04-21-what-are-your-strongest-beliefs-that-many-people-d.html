**Content:** [I have deep convictions that conflict with my own
emotions, as well as others\' beliefs.\
\
The one that gets me in the most trouble: I believe that gay people
should be allowed to marry. I believe that gay people should find a
church that believes the way they do and get married. I also believe
that states should be allowed to decide for themselves whether or not
they want to recognize gay marriage, and whether or not they want to
issue marriage licenses to gay couples. Finally, I believe that the
Federal government (not state governments), if they are going to allow
states to behave this way, should not tie any benefits whatsoever to
marital status. Whether or not states do is up to states. Where people
choose to live can then be based on the state that is most accepting of
them.\
\
That\'s a tough one when you truly believe that gay people should be
allowed to marry, but you also truly believe that states should have the
right to choose whether or not they accept that marriage. It isn\'t fair
to tie any benefits to marital status, especially at the Federal level
if the states are going to decide for themselves. Federal benefits must
be decoupled (no pun intended) from marital status.]{.rendered_qtext}
