**Is there some arcane parliamentary term for not delivering the
impeachment charges to the Senate?**

No, there is not. This is unprecedented in the history of the United
States.

A House drafting and passing Articles of Impeachment, yet failing to
deliver them to the Senate? Unheard of.

This essay discusses impeachment and the duties of the two houses. Note
that when they say "republican form of government" they are referring to
the fact that we are a representative republic, not a democracy.

In fact, Pelosi discussed this, as did Nadler and Schiff, as this
process was ongoing. They mentioned several times that it had no bearing
on them whether or not the Senate would convict, considering that it was
virtually assured that they would not. They felt it was their duty to
proceed with "deal\[ing\] with the miscreant's offenses, irrespective of
whether their bill of impeachment may or may not lead to a conviction in
the Senate."

That's why this new development is so unusual. They all said that it
matters not whether or not the Senate will convict, it's their
responsibility to pass articles.

How is it not their responsibility to let the Senate do its job too?
