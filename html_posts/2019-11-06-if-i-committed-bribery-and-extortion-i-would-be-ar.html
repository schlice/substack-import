**If I committed bribery and extortion I would be arrested. How is it
that Donald Trump can use these tactics without any repercussions? Why
are Republicans saying they do not care?**

Bribery and extortion are not "tactics." They are **crimes**.

If evidence of bribery and/or extortion is present, that evidence should
be taken immediately to the FBI so that it can be investigated.

So if someone had actual evidence that Trump had committed the crimes of
bribery or extortion, that evidence should go to the FBI and the US
Attorney's Office for action.

The lack of these actions indicates that there is no evidence that
either of those two crimes has taken place.
