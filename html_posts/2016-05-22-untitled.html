First of all, this is a specific legal question which is not allowed
under Quora policy. But I think the points you raise are important, so
I'll see what I can hit within the confines of the policy. Keep in mind
that this is not legal advice; if you have legal questions, including
"do I have a case" type questions, find a disability attorney in your
area. There are numerous websites which can help you locate an attorney
who specializes in ADA cases.

*Is there any way to legally collect on this?*

There is always a way. The question always remains just how successful
you will be, and you have an uphill climb ahead of you. You are going to
have to prove that you had the exact same job performance as your
contemporaries, you were equally rated, and you were equally regarded,
but for some unknown reason, you didn't get \[ raises \| promotions \]
and they did. Also, there needs to be something that tells you that they
specifically did not pay you more because you had a disability. Were you
passed over for promotions? Did you not get assignments because they
believed you couldn't handle it because of your disability? Did they
ever say as much? Did anyone else at the company besides your
supervisor(s) know about this treatment?

You start that process with your local EEOC (Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission) who will review your case and clear you to file
a lawsuit. They will issue you a "Notice of Right to Sue" which means
you can proceed with a lawsuit. Your attorney will assist you with all
aspects of your claim, including your EEOC filing.

*What is the statue* \[sic\] *of limitations?*

Depends on the claim. Remember that the whole purpose behind statutes of
limitations are to prevent stale claims. Memories get fuzzy, details
become less clear, and people generally forget things, making witnesses
harder and harder to find, and less reliable. Title I complaints
(employment discrimination) must be filed with the U.S. Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission (EEOC) within 180 days of the date of
discrimination, or 300 days if the charge is filed with a designated
State or local fair employment practice agency. Individuals may file a
lawsuit in Federal court only after they receive a \"right-to-sue\"
letter from the EEOC. Charges of employment discrimination on the basis
of disability may be filed at any U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission field office. Field offices are located in 50 cities
throughout the U.S. and are listed in most telephone directories under
\"U.S. Government.\" You said you were involved in potential
discrimination "several years ago," so it's likely that you cannot
proceed with your particular case.

You can see this process in action today, as Disney is being sued by the
families of autistic children over their new Disability Access System
(DAS) which replaced the Guest Access Card (GAC) system which was widely
abused. The Florida Commission on Human Relations (FCHR) ruled that
Disney did not provide appropriate accommodations and that the families
could proceed with their lawsuit, which has already been ruled in
Disney's favor at the municipal court level. The attorney for the
families is appealing. Most recently in the news, another family of an
autistic child was cleared by FCHR to be added as a plaintiff to the
lawsuit. The new Disability Access System, while providing some
accommodation to disabled guests, provides less accommodations than the
former system, and provides little to no assistance to autistic families
who still have to struggle with meltdowns because of the extended wait
times. This is incongruent with the provisions of ADA which require all
public facilities provide reasonable accommodations to their guests.

On a related but side note, I would also note that it provides little
assistance to those of us with MS, as the heat of the day saps our
energy, effectively cutting our day short. Without the assistance
provided by systems like GAC, my family enjoys a full day, while I enjoy
2/3 of a day. I will also note that a very friendly Guest Relations cast
member at Hollywood Studios assisted me on my last trip, providing me
with two additional Fastpass+ passes for each day of my trip which,
combined with my existing pre-selected Fastpass+ passes and my DAS
return times, really helped me enjoy my time much more. Plus, some
smarter scheduling of my time helped me to avoid the heat of the
afternoon (when lines are longest anyway).
