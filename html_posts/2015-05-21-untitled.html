**Content:** [Not for the officer. The officer has to get it right the
first time or he can face charges. Just look at Baltimore. Arrested
someone incorrectly and you face prosecution by the very state that
employs you.\
\
I suspect that the grand jury indictments of these officers will cause a
chilling effect across all departments, and more departments will simply
detain people (which they can do for up to 72 hours without pressing
charges) instead of outright arresting people. They will then take the
time to investigate thoroughly to ensure that the charges are valid.\
\
For the citizen, if an officer is arresting you, you must let him.
Failing to do that is resisting arrest.]{.rendered_qtext}
