Because she is a lying liar who lies.

She doesn't have any consistent policy. She will tell anybody whatever
they want to hear so that they will vote for her. You hate Israel? Sure,
I hate Israel, too! You hate Palestine? Sure, I hate Palestine, too!

She has no spine. She has no positions. She has no morals. She will do
anything to get elected and stay elected. Anything. Just ask Willie
Brown.
