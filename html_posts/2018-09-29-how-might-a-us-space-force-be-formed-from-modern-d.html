**How might a US Space Force be formed from modern-day elements of the
military?**

In 2018, when President Trump signed the [[John McCain National Defense
Authorization
Act](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=48fc8b&url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/5515/text){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="congress.gov"}]{.qlink_container}, it re-established
USSPACECOM as a Unified Combatant Command (UCC). USSPACECOM was merged
with USSTRATCOM when USNORTHCOM was established in 2002, because the
Unified Command Plan directed that there be no more than ten UCCs. When
NORTHCOM was established, one had to go.

Under the 2018 NDAA, USSPACECOM will be a sub-UCC under USSTRATCOM, run
by a 4-star, until it can become a full UCC.

I suspect that full UCC could easily be re-organized into the US Space
Force and assume all of the assets under it, which would suck in all
those component command assets. USSPACECOM consists of Air Force Space
Command, the largest component, headquartered at Peterson AFB in
Colorado, along with Army Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC) out
of Redstone, and Navy Space Command out of Dahlgren.
