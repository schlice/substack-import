I'm going to assume that you're talking about Larry Nassar, who used to
the the team doctor for the US Women's Gymnastics team.

So perhaps you are unaware, but [[Nassar was sentenced to 40--175 years
in
prison](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9ec41d&url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/24/us/larry-nassar-sentencing/index.html){.external_link

spend the rest of his natural life in jail.

I think someone did something about it.
