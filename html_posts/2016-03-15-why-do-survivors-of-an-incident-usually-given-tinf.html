It is a [[Heat Reflective Emergency
Blanket](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e86994&url=http://www.amazon.com/Reflective-Emergency-Blanket-Survival-blanket/dp/B000FNQ7A4){.external_link

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}, sometimes called a survival
blanket. It folds down to about the size of a deck of cards, so it\'s
very convenient to carry and keep with you in an emergency pack. Rescue
crews can carry lots of these in small amounts of space.

It would be silly if it didn\'t work, but it actually does keep you
warm! It reflects about 90% of your own body heat back to you, even in
temperatures below freezing. It\'s waterproof and thus rainproof.

In the heat, if you use it to create a small lean-to, it reflects solar
heat away from you, thus keeping you cooler underneath it than any
traditional covering could. Plus, with such a large reflective surface,
it\'s perfect for signaling rescue craft as to your location.
