**Is a concealed weapon the answer?**

It depends on the question.

If the question is, "How can I *(meaning me specifically)* best defend
and protect my own family?" then it is absolutely the answer. I have the
training and the requisite mindset and demeanor to handle the
repercussions of using a firearm in self-defense (or in defense of
another) and I'm fully prepared to face the gravity of that decision.

If the question is "What's your favorite ice cream flavor?" then it is
definitely not the answer.
