**What kind of surveillance camera (only 1 needed) can I get that
records 24/7 and can be mounted on high and still have good
zoom/resolution that I can install myself at my single family home?**

I think the one requirement that really limits the kind of system you
must buy is the requirement to "record 24/7."

We need to define what you mean by "record 24/7." If you mean that it
will always be watching and will record motion when it sees that,
virtually any camera system out there will do "event recording" where
the camera senses an event and records it. If "record 24/7" means that
you want to save *all* of the camera's feed, even if nothing is
happening, you need something backed by a larger hard drive, or the
cloud. I will assume you mean the latter: you want to record
*everything* the camera sees, all the time, 24/7.

If you want something backed by a hard drive, you need a local "DVR"
solution. Any of these with a DVR would be easy to install. Just make
sure that the camera system you choose will record 24/7:

If you want something backed by the cloud, you need Nest. Nest is the
only cloud-based service which will allow you to record and keep video
24/7 (as far as I know --- if anyone knows of another service which will
record and keep 24/7 video, let me know).

I have a system which records true 24/7 video. This works very well for
me as I can go back and review footage which often is outside of my
camera's "trigger" zone for events, but I want to see it anyway. I don't
want to miss something because my camera didn't choose to trigger on
that event.
