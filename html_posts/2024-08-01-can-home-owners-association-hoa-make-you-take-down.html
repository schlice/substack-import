**Yes.**

Even if there was no rule against it, the HOA can make you take it down.

The reason is in the very beginning of the rule which establishes the
HOA and (secondarily) the Architectural Control Committee (or
Architectural Review Committee or Architectural Review Board in some
HOAs). For now, I'll call it the ARC.

The charter of the ARC is to approve only changes which will enhance the
look and feel of the neighborhood and keep the neighborhood looking much
the same way as it did when it was designed. **ANY** change to the
outside of your home, **REGARDLESS** of whether or not it was listed as
an allowed or prohibited change, can be disallowed by the ARC (and by
extension, the Board).

So yes, if the ARC, ***in its sole discretion***, sees the change you
made and does not approve of how it makes your house (and by extension
the neighborhood) look, they can make you take it down. If you refuse,
they can fine you, and if you refuse to pay the fines, they can place a
lien against your house for the unpaid fines, late fees and (eventually)
attorney's fees, and if this goes on too long, they can foreclose on
that lien, selling your house out from under you to recoup their money.

Besides, there are other options to keeping sunlight out of your windows
in order to keep your house cool:

- Blackout curtains
- Low-E coatings on your glass which are not reflective from the outside
- Window tint (not reflective)

These changes would not make the windows appear unacceptable from the
street, but would still reduce heat transfer across the windows.

Because there is more than one option available to you, and the one you
chose is unacceptable visibly from the outside, the ARC (and by
extension, the Board) can tell you to take it down.

\

So how do you avoid making changes that the ARC and the Board will later
make you take down?

***Get approval for your change BEFORE you do it!***

So if you would have put in an ARC Request Form (all HOAs have them,
check your Governing Documents to find yours, or ask your Board for it)
before you put up aluminum foil on your windows, you would have found
out quite quickly that the ARC would have rejected that change. Then,
rather than wasting all that time putting up aluminum foil that you're
now going to have to take down, you could have investigated other
changes which would accomplish something similar for you but would not
unacceptably change the exterior appearance of your home.
