**Trump has put tariffs on steel and aluminum. Most Senate and
Congressional Republicans oppose him on this. Which side is wrong, and
how ought the wrong ones be punished?**

Congress has the ability to levy tariffs. However, over the years, they
have given that ability over to the President, because (they reason)
tariffs are a function more closely related to foreign relations
(Constitutionally in the President's wheelhouse) than to spending
(Constitutionally in Congress' wheelhouse).

Therefore, Congress can be as upset as they want to be with the
President, **but it was they who abrogated their own Constitutional
authority and gave it to the President.** They have even ceded control
of tariffs which don't demonstrably relate to foreign policy (like the
steel and aluminum tariffs). But they did it anyway.

For a more in-depth review of what has transpired over the years which
drove Congress to make these changes, [[this

In other words, *Congress has no one to blame but themselves.*

If they are that upset, perhaps they should rescind the orders they
signed which gave tariff control to the President.

But isn't this the current issue with our government? No one is actually
looking to Congress to fix anything anymore. Has anyone bothered to look
at Congress' approval ratings recently? No! Because they're too busy
looking at the President's ratings, which are historically 2--4 times
higher than those of Congress.

But because Congress is unable to do its job, it cedes power to the
Executive, whose branch is largely unelected (and therefore
unaccountable directly to the people).

*How should this be punished?* Congress should be fired and replaced
with representatives who will actually clean up Washington, and make
Congress an organization which is responsive to the people again.
