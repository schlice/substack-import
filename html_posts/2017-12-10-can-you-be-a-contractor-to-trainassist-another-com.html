In general, a non-compete agreement applies to any work you want to do
with a competitor, either as an employee or a contractor.

The key, of course, is it has to be a competitor, and the work would
have to fall under your current non-compete clause.

You can check with your current HR department to see if the company who
wishes to contract with you is a competitor, and to see if the work you
wish to contract would fall under non-compete.
