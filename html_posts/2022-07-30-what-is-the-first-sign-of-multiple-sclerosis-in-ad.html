It's difficult to say, since the "first" visible sign of MS varies from
person to person.

We can say that the most common "first symptom" is usually a vision
problem. And the most common vision problem is optic neuritis, which is
a swelling of the optic nerve behind the eyeball. It produces pain when
the eye is moved, along with blurry vision and sometimes a change in
color vision. Other possible vision issues associated with MS are
nystagmus ("dancing eyes") and diplopia (double vision).

Vision problems are just the most common first symptom of MS; they are
not the only one. Any MS symptom can be the "first" symptom.

The other problem with "first symptoms" is that you may actually be
experiencing symptoms before you are diagnosed, and you may not know it.
For example, I was experiencing mood and cognitive issues at least six
months before I had my first bout of optic neuritis, which led to my
diagnosis. The degree of degradation on my MRI is evidence that the
disease process was at work well before I was diagnosed, and sometimes
the symptoms are hard to distinguish from other causes.
