Extremely unlikely.

There aren't any states attempting to challenge the precedent set by
*Obergefell.* What we do see is that states have strengthened their
religious and conscience rights, and have made it so that the individual
cannot be *compelled* to marry a same-sex couple.

This could come to a head if someone is forced, in violation of their
conscience or religion, to perform a same-sex marriage ceremony (so
either a religious organization or, more likely, a government official
like a county clerk). The former is an easy 1st Amendment issue, so is
unlikely to make it back up to the SCOTUS. The latter, however, in terms
of conscience protections, would likely see states doing even more to
either protect the conscience of the individual, or to protect the
rights of the same-sex couple.

But *Obergefell* was not like *Roe* in that it was not decided on the
basis of poor jurisprudence. *Roe* was decided on a right which does not
exist in the Constitution, which left it ripe for overturn. *Obergefell*
suffers no such poor basis: it was decided based on the Due Process
clause and the Equal Protection clause of the 14th Amendment, not based
on a vapid "right to privacy" like *Roe*. It is a solid legal precedent
and is unlikely to be overturned any time soon.
