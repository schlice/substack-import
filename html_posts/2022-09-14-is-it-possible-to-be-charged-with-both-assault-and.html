Assault and battery are two separate offenses. But you don't get
"charged" with assault and battery, you get "sued" for assault and
battery.

Criminal assault includes both the assault (the threat of physical harm)
and the battery (the actual physical harm). "Assault" and "battery" (in
the jurisdictions which have these torts) are *civil* crimes, and so you
can be sued separately for assault, or for battery, or for both together
(which is where the term "assault and battery" comes from).

Remember, these crimes are state-level crimes, and they are not defined
equally across all of the states. This definition is only applicable to
the states which have assault and battery as separate torts, and don't
call their criminal assault crime "assault and battery."
