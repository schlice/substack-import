**If Trump offered to end his re-election bid in exchange for an
uncontested approval of his SCOTUS pick, would you take the deal?**

Why would he do that? He already has enough votes in the Senate to
confirm his SCOTUS pick.

Democrats do not want to support his SCOTUS pick, whether he ends his
re-election bid or not. Their dissent of his pick is not rooted in his
re-election campaign, but in the views of his pick. Those views won't
change based on his re-election campaign. Democrats will continue to
oppose his SCOTUS pick, whether he's running or not. But he doesn't need
them to agree; he has enough votes to confirm his pick without them.

It would be horrible to take away the opinions of Democrats simply
because Trump decides not to run.
