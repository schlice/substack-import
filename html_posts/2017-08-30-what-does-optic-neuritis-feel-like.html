I add to the body of evidence my ON story.

I woke up one morning to find that I "couldn't rub the sleep out of my
eye." My eye, specifically the lower part of my field of vision, was
blurry. My eye hurt any time I looked away from center. When I walked
into the darkened closet, I saw sparklers (รก la the 4th of July kind)
around the outside of my field of view. Thinking that it was just
pressure from allergies, I figured it would get better in the shower,
but it got worse. When I got out, it got better again. When I went out
into the bright sunlight or under fluorescent lights, my whole field of
view got washed out. Remember the "Brightness" and "Contrast" knobs on
old-style televisions? The image from my right eye looked like someone
had turned the Contrast knob way up. Also, my depth perception was
slower from my right eye than it was from my left, so when my son threw
the baseball, I couldn't catch it because I saw the ball in double while
it was flying at me.

The ophthalmologist knew right away that it was optic neuritis. The pain
was caused by pulling the optic nerve as the eye turned away from
center. The blurry vision and sparklers were effects of the swelling,
and the lower speed of image transmission was caused by the reduced
speed of image transmission through the area.

In people my age (at the time), it was about half of the time that the
issue was caused by Multiple Sclerosis, and the other half of the time,
it was not (the ON occurred on its own and resolved on its own).
