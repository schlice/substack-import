**Do I have a good chance or getting this speed ticket dismissed? A cop
pulled over for going 66 mph in a 65 mph zone and this seems incredibly
silly. I don\'t even think radar guns can be this accurate.**

Unfortunately, they are. And if you're thinking of the ***cosine
effect***, the net effect of this would *not* be that the gun would read
higher than your actual speed, but that the gun would read slower than
your actual speed by a mile or two.

radar?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-margin-of-error-of-police-radar/answer/Miles-Gordon-3)]{.qlink_container}

So unless you're going to argue that the gun was miscalibrated, it's
unlikely that you could say that the margin of error of the radar gun
caused it to read faster than the car was actually travelling.
