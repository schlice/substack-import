**Should you take note of the license plate number of a vehicle that
speeds past you on a double line (no passing zone)?**

You can. You can take that license plate to the police agency which
covers that stretch of road and file a citizen's complaint. Yes, you
will have to do it in person. But if the passing was egregious enough to
you, then you can go and file.
