These are actually good questions. Let me answer them:

> When will we outgrow religion?

When we figure out where we came from. Because we certainly didn't
spontaneously generate from goo in the ocean. In other words, the
universe didn't create us, because it makes no sense how a purposeless,
meaningless, random universe would birth creatures (us) filled with
purpose and meaning and with an inbuilt sense of right and wrong. The
Law of Causation says that this is simply impossible. Our DNA is
"specified complexity," meaning it is complex, but it is specifically
tailored to deliver a message, and only intelligence creates messages.
Nature, in all of its randomness, never produces messages.

So until we find our creator (assuming our creator is not the God of the
Bible), there will always be a place for religion.

So let's address the first part, how belief in the divine acts as a
crutch. It seems like you believe in the "god of the gaps" theory of
religion, wherein God just fills the space of "things we don't yet know"
until we know them.

So let's turn this back on you: your religion is what is called
***Scienceism*** (I'd call it Scientology, but someone took that name
already). You have *faith*, just as the theists do. You, however, have
faith that *someday*, science **will** answer all those tricky unknown
questions of the universe, like how did we form here, where did we come
from, and how did nature create specified complexity when it has never
done so ever, with anything else.

To me, that's a lot of faith. You really have to have a ton of faith to
believe that non-life produces life, randomness produces fine-tuning,
chaos produces order, unconsciousness produces consciousness; and
non-reason produces reason. Those leaps of faith are certainly too big
for me to take, especially in light of the affirmative case for God\'s
existence.

In other words, in my assessment the Christian worldview accounts for
the totality of the evidence much better than the atheistic worldview.

Now, let's address the second part of your statement: "Religion has
caused untold grief and misery on this planet and continues to do so." I
wonder if you can illuminate exactly the grief and misery you're talking
about, especially since you said that religion has caused "untold"
amounts of it.

I won't say that all religions are good. I also will not say that all
religions are right. That makes no sense. We can't *all* be right.
Christianity teaches that Jesus raised from the dead. Islam teaches that
Jesus never died. We can't both be right. One of us has to be wrong. So
the whole "all religions are right in their own way" is BS. In the
analogy of the blind men and the elephant, it is said that no one has
the full view of the elephant. They all see their little piece and
presume they're looking at something not an elephant. Except for one
small problem: there is one person who has the full view: *the
narrator*. Someone always has *the one right answer*. Someone has the
correct box top that will allow us to solve the puzzle of life. But only
one religion has that.

Is it because religion promotes *tribalism*? Either you're in, or you're
out. You're either saved, or you're damned. Is that why? I'd agree with
you, except for that belief is your choice. No one is forcing you to
believe. God *wants it that way.* I mean, if he descended from the
heavens and raised the dead and healed the sick and zapped the bad guys
and killed Satan and made all wars cease, you would have ***no choice***
but to believe in him, right? Because if you spoke out against him, he'd
zap you away, too. **But that's exactly the opposite of free will**. God
wants you to see what he's offering, put it up against what Satan is
offering, and freely choose him. No pressure, no demands, just choose
him. That's what he wants. You're never going to be forced to be a
Christian. God does the hard work of conversion, not man.

But atheism has a fatal flaw. *What if there really is a God?*

What if there really is an afterlife? And what if it is eternal? The
truth is, eternity is an awfully long time to be wrong.

I'll leave you with this: all world religions require some task of the
believer so that they can earn their salvation...

...except one. Only one religion teaches that God has given us our
salvation as a gift, through his grace, and by his mercy. All we have to
do is *accept that gift.*

Yes, that religion is Christianity. And I believe that the Christian
worldview fits the evidence better than any other worldview, including
the atheistic worldview.
