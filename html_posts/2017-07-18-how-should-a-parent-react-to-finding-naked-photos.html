*(For this answer, I'm assuming facts not in evidence, your honor. I'm
assuming that she willingly took the pictures of herself, and I'm
assuming she gave them to someone. If she did not, you should clarify in
the comments so we don't answer the wrong question)*

For your sake, I hope this has not happened to you.

Once an image has hit the Internet, it's forever. It's really hard to
get images off of the Internet once they're out there. There are
services which purport to do this for you, but they are not free, and
they are not cheap. I'd look at
[[DeleteMe](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5d8f4b&url=https://www.abine.com/deleteme/landing.php){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="abine.com"}]{.qlink_container} because Abine is a reputable
company, but there are others.

How should you respond to your underage daughter?

- First, you sit her down and explain that the Internet is forever, and
  those photos will now appear any time someone searches for her online.
  Employers routinely search potential employees before hiring them. She
  may have hampered her future employability.
- Second, explain why the criminal defense attorney is also sitting with
  you. He's there because he may have to defend you against charges of
  *distributing child pornography.* Yes, if you distribute in electronic
  form pornographic images of someone below the legal age of consent,
  this is distribution of child pornography, and she can be arrested.
  Work with the lawyer to prepare to defend yourself in case the police
  come knocking.\
  (EDIT) I recognize that she may not have distributed the pictures,
  which makes the conversation with the police a little less awkward,
  but to be fair, the pictures did not take themselves, unless they were
  "hidden camera" photos, which I am assuming they are not. If they are,
  then **you** should be calling the police, not the other way round.
- Next, explain to her why she will be going to counseling. The need for
  acceptance and the need for validation are obviously so great that she
  would seek to demean herself to such a degree to gain it. And you as
  the parent should also seek your own counseling to figure out what you
  may have done in your life to encourage and/or fail to prevent such
  behavior. You all have a lot of work to do.
- Finally, explain why she's going to be home-schooled and lose access
  to all electronic communications media until she turns 18. Why
  home-schooled? The entire school will have seen her pictures. Even
  most of the teachers, the pervs that they are. Either that, or
  consider relocating your family to another state.

Sound kinda doom-and-gloom? ***Teenage girls have*** ***killed
themselves for less than nude photos.*** The stress that continuing to
live in the community will place on your daughter will be immense, and
she needs to be prepared for that. Counseling will help, but she's got a
long road ahead of her.

You need to get out in front of this *now.*
