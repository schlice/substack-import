As with most states, the left lane is called the "passing" lane. This
means the left lane is designated for traffic that is desiring to
"pass." If you are not passing the car ahead of you in the right lane,
you should move back to the right lane, which is known as the "travel"
lane. On three-lane roads, the right and center lanes are travel lanes,
and the left lane is a passing lane.

So when they say "driving" in the left lane, what they are actually
referring to is "traveling" in the left lane without passing someone.

Generally, this provision of the traffic code goes unenforced unless the
person in the left lane is causing a traffic hazard by impeding traffic
so badly that it is forced to pass on the right, which is more
dangerous.
