**Has anyone experienced this? I already have an approved moral waiver
to enlist but was told my waiver needs to be sent up to MEPS first so it
could be OK'd and I'd have to wait another two weeks for MEPS.**

Yes, this is common for some moral waivers.

You've passed the biggest hurdle --- finding a recruiter who was willing
to process your waiver. In general, recruiters won't even file a moral
waiver if they don't believe it has a chance of being approved.

But bear in mind, MEPS can still deny the waiver. Your recruiter
approved your waiver, but more serious offenses have to go higher up the
recruiting chain before they are approved, so that may be what's going
on here.

The waiver process is *very* subjective, so don't be surprised if it
gets denied at MEPS. For example, if the waiver goes up to a Colonel at
MEPS who had his house burglarized, and you have a burglary waiver, do
you think he's going to approve it?

If it does get disapproved, you might think about trying a different
service. The Army has the reputation of approving the most moral
waivers. The Air Force and Coast Guard approve the fewest. The Navy and
Marine Corps fall somewhere in between. In that event, it would be worth
checking with another recruiter.
