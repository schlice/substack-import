Funny, I went to KissAsian .com and look what I found:

:::: ui_qtext_image_outer
::: qtext_image_wrapper
![](images/qimg-22153ea3bb17e8cbf5673e805608e4c8){.landscape
.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed
master_src="images/qimg-22153ea3bb17e8cbf5673e805608e4c8" master_w="962"
master_h="733"}

So to answer your question, yes, it appears that KissAsian .com was
operating illegally.

In case you were wondering, [[ABS-CBN
Corporation](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=15f769&url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="abs-cbn.com"}]{.qlink_container} is "the Philippines'
leading media and entertainment organization. Primarily involved in
television and radio, the Company has since expanded and now owns the
leading cinema and music production/distribution outfits in the country
and operates the largest cable TV service provider as well."
