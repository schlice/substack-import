**How plausible is Mr Trump\'s suggestion that covid-19 originated in a
Chinese lab? It seems that the US\'s virus labs have very sloppy
procedures too (see link) and may well have posted live virus in a cheap
jiffy-bag to their colleagues in Wuhan.**

"Mr. Trump's suggestion"? Like he came up with the idea on his own? Like
he was sitting on the can one day and thought, "Hmm, I bet those Chinese
baked up this coronavirus in a lab."

No, someone told him that "suggestion."

In fact, it was a whole lot of "someones" who told him that
"suggestion."

True, it is not definitive, until investigations reveal the truth:

And yes, I have to quote the center-right Fox News because no one else
is carrying this. This is a Fox News exclusive.
