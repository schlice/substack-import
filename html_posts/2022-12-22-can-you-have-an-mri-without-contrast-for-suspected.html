Yes, you can have an MRI without contrast.

The contrast dye, along with a specific type of MRI scan, will show
***current disease activity***. So in order to show whether or not the
disease is ***active right now***, we use an MRI scan with contrast.

Without contrast, we will still be able to see the effects of the
disease, and performing multiple MRI scans over a period of time will
show disease progression when the scans are compared side-by-side.

If you cannot use contrast, a scan without contrast will still be very
useful, and will add to the body of evidence in diagnosing MS.

There are other tests which can be added to enhance the body of evidence
showing MS. Besides blood tests which can show other diseases and
conditions which produce white spots on an MRI (which we call the
"little white spot panel"), we can do things like lumbar punctures
(spinal taps) and visual evoked potential tests to add to the evidence
indicating MS. The physical neurological exam is not to be discounted
either, as a trained neurologist can detect the signs of the disease
during a physical neuro exam.
