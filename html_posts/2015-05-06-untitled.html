<h2>Answer Comment</h2>
<div>

**Content:** [You\'re correct, almost every jurisdiction requires
compliance with the lawful order of a peace officer.\
\
The key word there is \"lawful.\"\
\
If I don\'t have the authority to stop you, then my order for you to
stop would be \"unlawful.\"\
\
Clearly, this wouldn\'t be something you would sort out at the scene,
but your lawyer would get your entire case thrown out even if you had
the smoking gun in your pocket from a recent murder. It\'s called the
\"fruit of the poisonous tree\" doctrine. Because the stop was unlawful,
everything that follows from the stop is also unlawful and inadmissible
in court.\
\
So in summary: do what they are telling you, and let your lawyer sort
the rest out; that\'s what you pay them for.]{.rendered_qtext}
