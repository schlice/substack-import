The Fourteenth Amendment\'s Equal Protection Clause guarantees that no
state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal
protection of the laws.

In the context of transgender athletes, Federal law (backed now by
Executive Order and Supreme Court rulings) recognizes that
**discrimination on the basis of sex does not include those who identify
as transgender. Discrimination on the basis of sex refers specifically
to biological sex.**

Therefore, the Equal Protection Clause guarantees that states may not
discriminate against people due to their ***biological sex***.
