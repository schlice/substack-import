**What happens if humans no longer have an emotion of embarrassment so
100% surveillance will prevent more problems and there will be no more
privacy and secrets?**

Humans develop a sense of what is public and what is private at
somewhere around age 3 to 4. Not long after, they begin to develop a
sense of modesty about that which is private. Granted, some of the
modesty is dictated by society, but even children innately know the
difference between what is public and what is private.

There is no evolutionary shift that will "deprogram" the fact that some
things are public and some things are private.

We would simply have to nurture the idea that even private things are
not private from the government before a 100% surveillance state could
ever be workable. This is not something that would happen overnight.
