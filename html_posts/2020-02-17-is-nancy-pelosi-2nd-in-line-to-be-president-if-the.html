**Is Nancy Pelosi 2nd in line to be President if the President and Vice
President could not be for some reason?**

The Vice President is first in line in the [[Presidential Succession
Act](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c34707&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Succession_Act){.external_link

is second in line, and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate is third.

So if the President and Vice President were killed simultaneously, the
Speaker of the House would become President, and would finish out the
term.
