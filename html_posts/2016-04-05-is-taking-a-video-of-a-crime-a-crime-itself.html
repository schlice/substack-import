In the United States, it\'s not really illegal to record much. The
general rule is **if you can see it, you can shoot it**. If it is
occurring in a place where there is no reasonable expectation of
privacy, and where there is no specific exclusion on video recordings
(i.e. certain government buildings, etc), it\'s perfectly legal to
record anything, including the commission of a crime. What\'s more
important about recording a crime is not the act of recording the crime,
but what is done with the video afterward.

If you are, truly, a bystander, meaning you don\'t know what they are
about to do, you never encouraged them to do it, and you are not a
participant, but you record the commission of a crime, what is most
important is what you do with the recording.

The law enforcement side of me says you should immediately take the
video to the police. If the police can use the video and find the
victim, they can arrest the perpetrators and charge them with the crime.

The friend side of me would say that you should tell your friends to
turn themselves in along with the video. Prosecutors will tell you that
there is a lot to be said for voluntary compliance, especially when the
crime would have otherwise been very difficult, time-consuming and
costly to solve. Prosecutors will work with you if you work with them. I
would convince my friends that it\'s in their best interest to take the
video down to the police station themselves and turn themselves in.
Anything else would be worse for them. If they don\'t turn themselves in
and they get caught, they will face much harsher penalties than if they
voluntarily come forward. They will get off with a much lighter sentence
if they turn themselves in.
