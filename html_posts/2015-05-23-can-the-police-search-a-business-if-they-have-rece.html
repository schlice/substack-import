**Content:** [They can use the call (known as a \"tip\") to open an
investigation. If the investigation reveals enough information to get a
warrant, a judge will issue a warrant allowing the police to search for
something specific. The police can then execute that warrant, looking
for the items detailed in the warrant.]{.rendered_qtext}
