The free will isn't for Him. The free will is for **you*.*** Just
because He can see what you chose even though you haven't gotten there
yet doesn't mean that the free will itself isn't important.

Free will permits you to be accountable for your own decisions

This makes no logical sense. If you didn't want to make the choice, then
why did you make the choice? You have free will. You could have freely
chosen the other choice. Hardly anyone chooses something they did not
want to choose.

You chose the desire of your heart at the moment of choice. You desired
that more than anything else, and that's what you chose. Nearly everyone
chooses in this way.

Therefore, since you are free to make any choice at the moment of
choosing, the choice you make indicates what your greatest desire is at
that moment.

**TLDR: We are all responsible for the choices we freely make**
