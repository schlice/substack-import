**What is the best (legal) way for Trump\'s administration to stop the
caravan from crossing Mexico into the United States?**

They can go so far as to close the border to all non-citizens.

The President has the sole authority to close the border at his
discretion, to any individual or group, for any reason he deems
appropriate for national security. All legal, part of Federal law.

They will probably just have Border Patrol watch them at the border.
Anyone illegally entering the US will be arrested. Everyone else will be
handled at the border crossing.

I have no doubt that the group will not be illegally crossing in to the
US.
