**Content:** [There\'s an old adage in media:\
\
\"If it bleeds, it leads. If it thinks, it stinks.\"\
\
The reason mainstream US news agencies focus so heavily on violent
crimes is because that\'s what draws viewers/readers. Intelligent
discussion and discourse, logic, reasoning, etc. are not what draws
viewers/readers, and are relegated to the back pages.\
\
Ultimately, news agencies are for-profit businesses, and they have to do
whatever they can to increase their viewer/reader base. If violent crime
increases the number of eyeballs on your news program (and, by
extension, your advertising), that\'s what you run. You run what people
\"want,\" and people determine what they want by the number of eyeballs
looking at your content.]{.rendered_qtext}
