The woman has several options:

1.  Carry the baby to term and deal with the "serious problems" after
    the baby is born, assuming the baby survives the birth.
2.  Go to a state which allows abortion for any reason and get an
    abortion. Planned Parenthood, the nation's largest abortion
    provider, can't provide abortions in states which ban them, but they
    have resources to connect you to agencies which can help you find a
    provider in an abortion-friendly state, as well as helping you pay
    for gas, flights, travel, meals, and childcare expenses.
3.  The riskiest option (and the option that is *potentially* illegal,
    depending on your state): apply for and get abortion pills through
    the mail. However, this is extremely risky, especially if you are at
    the point in your pregnancy where you could identify "serious
    problems." Usually, abortion pills are only medically safe in
    pregnancies up to 10 weeks. But major fetal abnormalities can
    usually only be detected after roughly 10 or 11 weeks of gestation.
    Some anomalies, such as spina bifida, heart defects, or
    diaphragmatic hernia, cannot be reliably detected before 13 weeks of
    gestation. The CDC recommends a first trimester screening between
    weeks 11 and 13 of pregnancy to look for certain birth defects, such
    as Down syndrome or chromosomal disorders. Therefore, abortion pills
    may not be appropriate, and if you take them, you could be placing
    your own health at serious risk, and it may be illegal in your
    state.
