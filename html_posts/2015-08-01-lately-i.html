**Content:** [Let\'s play a hypothetical game. Let\'s say you could
communicate with a baby in the womb. How would you describe the things
it is going to see when it is born? Would you say, \"Hey, baby, there is
this stuff called air, and it smells wonderul, except when it doesn\'t,
and there are these things called trees, and they\'re fun to climb on,
but I know you don\'t understand fun, or climbing, but it\'ll all make
sense when you get out here. And don\'t get me started on chili dogs.\"\
\
Could you imagine how difficult it would be to try to explain concepts
like this to a baby in the womb? The baby would literally have no
understanding of anything you\'re talking about. Similarly, Isaiah 55:9
explains God\'s dilemma when trying to explain concepts like Heaven to
us: \"As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher
than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.\" God\'s mind is so,
so far greater than ours that we can\'t even begin to hope to understand
His ways.\
\
So with that understanding, how can we possibly know what God is
thinking? How can we even hope to know what His plans for us are? He is
so much higher in thinking than we are that we can\'t even comprehend
the plans he has.\
\
Who are we to say that God is unfair? By whose standards? Ours? Are we
in charge here? Are we to be so presumptuous that we say, \"God, you are
totally unfair, I want you to fix it!\" The thought borders on the
blasphemous.\
\
We don\'t run the show, God does. We\'re not in charge here, He is. We
can never hope to understand His plans until we see Him face to face and
He enlightens us.\
\
The best we can do is to pray for more understanding. It reminds me of
when Kennedy quoted Phillips Brooks and he said, \"Don\'t pray for an
easy life, pray to be better men.\" Don\'t get angry with God because
you don\'t understand His plan; you can never hope to. Pray for more
tolerance and understanding of His ways.]{.rendered_qtext}
