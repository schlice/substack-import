*Every bullet you fire has a lawyer attached to it.*

Every time you fire your gun in self-defense, you are risking jail time.
Doesn't matter if you were fully justified. That's a question of *law*
to be decided by a *court*. When you fire your gun outside of the range,
expect to be arrested and expect to spend at least the night in jail.
Expect to be charged with a crime, and even if you are justified, expect
to be sued for wrongful death by the estate of the deceased (if your
target died).

If you carry a gun, you had better have a lawyer on speed-dial.
Thankfully, organizations like the [[US Concealed Carry
Association](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=40afa4&url=https://www.usconcealedcarry.com/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="usconcealedcarry.com"}]{.qlink_container} (USCCA) (not a
sponsor...yet...call me) exist to provide concealed carry training and,
more importantly to this discussion, legal protection to concealed
carriers who use their firearms in self-defense. They have a network of
attorneys ready to assist you should you be arrested following a
self-defense incident. Membership in USCCA is a must if you are going to
carry in public. No one tells you this.

Just as important to the legal representation is appropriate training.
Not everyone who knows how to use a gun should be carrying one in
public. Specific, tailored training for concealed carriers is essential.
