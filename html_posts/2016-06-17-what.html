I personally am a fan of [[Alien Gear
Holsters](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=793d4c&url=http://aliengearholsters.com/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="aliengearholsters.com"}]{.qlink_container} as they are very
adjustable and very comfortable, both IWB and OWB. All of their holsters
are fully adjustable, including the tilt, ride height, and retention.
They are also made to facilitate multiple guns. Their holster shells
allow people to easily swap out their holster shell with a new one to
match whatever gun you wish to carry.
