As usual, the esteemed senator from Texas is a bit hyperbolic and was
actually joking when he made that comment.

But all good jokes are based, at least in part, on a little bit of
truth.

It has been revealed that Disney executives [[support a
"not-at-all-secret gay
agenda"](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d04ed7&url=https://nypost.com/2022/03/30/disney-producer-cops-to-adding-queerness-to-animated-shows/){.external_link

Disney video products.

Support for Florida's measure has been both vocal and overwhelming.
Disney is finding itself on the wrong side of Florida parents' wishes.
But now, parents aren't sitting idly by. They are [[cancelling their
Disney+ subscriptions, as well as Disney
vacations](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6254ee&url=https://thepostmillennial.com/people-canceling-disney){.external_link

company's not-so-secret shift left.

Original question:

What do you think about Ted Cruz saying that Democrats opposition to
Florida\'s \"don\'t say gay\" law is going to lead to Disney showing
kids cartoons of Mickey and Pluto having sex on Disney channel?
