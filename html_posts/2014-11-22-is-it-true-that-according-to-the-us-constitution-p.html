**Content:** [Obama did not change how an existing law is being executed
as there is no current law that allows for what he has done.\
\
Presidents can change how an existing law is executed. They can even
invoke *prosecutorial discretion* in how we prosecute violators of the
law. He did not do this. Every other decision that other presidents have
made were in the spirit of, in keeping with, the spirit of an existing
law.\
\
In contrast, what he has done is in direct contradiction with existing
law. He made new law. no existing law allows for what he did. Making new
law is clearly unconstitutional.\
\
Also, to answer the original question, the Constitution does not
authorize the president to make law if Congress does
not.]{.rendered_qtext}
