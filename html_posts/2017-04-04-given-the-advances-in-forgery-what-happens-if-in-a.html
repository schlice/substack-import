Given the advances in forgery is not a necessary qualifier. For the
moment, let's remove that part.

Let's just discuss the other part: *What happens if, in a court of law,
I say that I didn\'t sign an agreement even if I did?*

You are committing *perjury*, which means you are lying under oath.

It is up to the prosecution to present evidence that you are lying. In
other words, it's up to the prosecutor to prove that you actually did
sign the agreement (i.e. witnesses who observed you sign the agreement,
testimony regarding statements you may have made about the agreement,
etc).

If you are found to have committed perjury, you can be held in *contempt
of court* and the local prosecutor can charge you.
