First of all, what the HOA has the power to do is in your Governing
Documents.

Second, you may have a provision about "nuisances" somewhere in your
Governing Documents, usually in your Rules and Regulations document. If
your smoking can be considered a "nuisance odor" to your neighbors,
especially if you're smoking something particularly pungent (i.e.
cigars, marijuana, etc.), they can tell you to not smoke on your patio,
and they can fine you if you continue to do it.
