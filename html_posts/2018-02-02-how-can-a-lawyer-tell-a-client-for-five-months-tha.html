Your question doesn't make sense, as a judge issues a court order, not a
lawyer.

A lawyer can't request a court order. A lawyer can file a motion, but
depending on whether or not you have already gone to court, there are a
limited amount of non-hearing motions that can be filed.

You may be waiting for your lawyer to file a motion for summary
judgment, but there would have to be no genuine issues of material fact
which must be litigated. If there is at least one genuine issue of
material fact, motions for summary judgment will be denied and the issue
will be moved forward to trial.

Without more supporting detail, we don't really know what your lawyer is
waiting for.

Perhaps it would be worth a second opinion. From another lawyer.
