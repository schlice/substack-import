**Designing a downtown streetscape. Is the city responsible for building
ADA accessible ramps into businesses if none currently exist and would
technically be in the right-of-way, or is it the responsibility of the
business owner?**

The business is responsible for building ADA accessible ramps into
businesses if they are required.

The city is tasked with designing a streetscape which is capable of
accepting ADA accessible ramps if they are needed. If the design can be
accommodated, perhaps the design could obviate the need for a ramp at
all (i.e. building the sidewalk at threshold level).
