**If the Senate trial were to proceed with witnesses and evidence, do
you believe Donald Trump would resign to prevent whatever he is hiding
from becoming public knowledge?**

If the Senate trial were to allow witnesses, Trump will laugh all the
way to victory in 2020.

Because if Democrats call John Bolton, Republicans will call Joe Biden.
If Democrats call Mick Mulvaney, Republicans will call Hunter Biden. And
so on.

If we're going to re-litigate and re-investigate what the House already
investigated and voted on, then Republicans will use the opportunity to
investigate what the House failed to investigate: whether or not Trump's
motives were indeed truly corrupt, by investigating Hunter Biden and his
ties to Burisma. Republicans will also want to know whether or not Trump
had a legitimate reason to call for Ukraine to investigate whether Joe
Biden used his influence in the Obama administration to block the
investigation into Burisma, by withholding US aid.

It is House managers who opened this door, referencing Hunter Biden in
their *opening statement*. If Hunter Biden is in scope in this trial, we
want to hear from him.
