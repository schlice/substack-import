<h2>Answer Comment</h2>
<div>

**Content:** [Latest estimates from real reliable sources estimate that
almost 50,000 were issued in 2005, and between 1999 and 2005 there have
been about 40 that have gone wrong. So even if it was 40 in one year
(which it is not), that would still be only one in every 1,250, or
0.08%.\
\
If this qualifies as \"often\" to you, then I believe you are correct.\
\
To me, this is not even close to often. Yes, mistakes happen, and they
are tragic when they do. I don\'t deny that people make mistakes. I just
disagree with you as to frequency.]{.rendered_qtext}
