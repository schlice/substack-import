A Qi-capable device (Qi is pronounced \"chee\") is a device that
supports \"wireless charging.\" Wireless charging uses a theory of
magnetism called \"induction\" whereby a current is \"induced\" in an
electrical wire by a magnetic field nearby.

If you have an electric toothbrush, it uses inductive charging when you
set it on its base. No contacts are exposed because of the waterproof
housing, but the battery is charged anyway.

In mobile phones, the standard is called \"Qi.\"

Generally, a mobile phone is not designed to be both a Qi-capable
receiver **and** separately a Qi-capable charger. No phone that I know
of has a charging circuit that can provide a charge to another device.
It adds too much bulk to the phone in a period of time when
manufacturers are striving to make phones slimmer and lighter.

(EDIT) Now, devices can both charge themselves wirelessly, and use their
batteries to charge other wireless devices wirelessly as well. Samsung's
version of this is called "Wireless Power Sharing." I use it on trips to
charge my watch while I charge my phone with a cable. I only need one
cable and I can charge my phone and my watch at the same time.
