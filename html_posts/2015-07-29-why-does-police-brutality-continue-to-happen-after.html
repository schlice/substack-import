**Content:** [*Don\'t those burglars know that burglary is unacceptable?
If so why do some burglars still act unlawfully?*\
\
*Don\'t those rapists know that rape is unacceptable? If so why do some
rapists still act unlawfully?*\
\
This is not a silly conflation. If someone is going to break the law,
they are going to break the law. If someone is going to violate policy,
they are going to violate policy.\
\
The question you **should** be asking is when are police departments
going to get tougher on officers who continually engage in behavior
commonly referred to as \"police brutality,\" or what the department
calls \"excessive use of force?\"\
\
The answer is when public opinion sours enough that the department is
forced to change its policy regarding UOF incidents.]{.rendered_qtext}
