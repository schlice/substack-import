China has taken on a very strict "Covid-zero" policy to try to eradicate
the virus. Because there is a not-zero chance that your cat or dog can
transmit the virus to a human (even though that risk is really, really
small), once the pets were found to be Covid-positive, they were
euthanized.

The US doesn't recommend euthanizing Covid-positive pets. They instead
recommend the more commonsense approach of isolating the pets in a room
and wearing gloves when handling or interacting with them, until they
test negative.

You know, kinda like you do with Covid-positive *people*.

China has never been known for proportionality, so this doesn't surprise
me at all.

Original question:

What are your thoughts on people\'s pets being euthanized in China
because of COVID-19 precautions?
