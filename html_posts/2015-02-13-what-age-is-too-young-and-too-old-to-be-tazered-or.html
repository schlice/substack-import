is correct. Age is generally not a factor; level of threat is a factor.
If an 80-year old woman was running around downtown wielding a machete
hacking people up, my first thought would not be \"Gee, I hope she\'s
not too old for me to deploy the TASER against,\" it would be \"I hope
the TASER stops her or I\'m going to have to shoot her.\" Because of her
advanced age, it\'s possible that the TASER could have unintended side
effects such as exacerbating a pre-existing heart condition, but we
either stop her from hacking people up, or we worry about whether or not
the TASER is going to hurt her more or less than a bullet. I vote for
stopping her. The same would hold true if it was a 10-year old boy
hacking up a mall with a samurai sword.\
\
Now, if an 80-year old or a 10-year old were simply being belligerent
and resistant, would the TASER be appropriate? Probably not, and we
would, as always, start at the lowest level of the force scale and work
our way up as required. Pepper spray might be a better option here than
a TASER. But each situation is different and has to be judged on its own
merits.\
\
When employing any method of force, as I just alluded to, we have
what\'s called a *continuum of force* which includes hand-to-hand,
pepper spray, baton, TASER, and finally ends with a firearm. We have
lots of options here, and we have to use the lowest level of force that
will safely stop the aggressor, regardless of age.\
\
The TASER is only shown to be harmful against people with pre-existing
medical conditions, such as heart conditions or asthma. However, since
we can\'t know someone\'s pre-existing medical conditions before
deploying the TASER, we don\'t judge whether or not we will employ a
particular level of force based on the age or relative health of the
aggressor, we judge what force is used based on the threat the person
poses.]{.rendered_qtext}
