**How does the government get away with so many illegal taxes that they
impose on us?**

I suppose first you'd have to identify what taxes you consider to be
"illegal." I wasn't aware that the government had a restriction on what
taxes they can legally levy and what taxes are "against the law" to
levy. I know that poll taxes are specifically restricted, but I haven't
seen a poll tax in a long time.

There was a time when the courts said that taxes which were regulatory
in nature (rather than revenue-producing) were not Constitutional, but
they reversed that position. Taxes which are purely regulatory (i.e.
designed to get you to behave in a certain way) are legal, and several
court decisions provided for the legality of those taxes. Most recently,
the court ruled on *National Federation of Independent Business v.
Sebelius (2012)*, which found that a purely regulatory tax (the
"individual mandate" portion of Obamacare) was Constitutional
specifically because it operated as a tax.

Anyway, if we assume that the government is actually taxing citizens in
violation of the law, they get away with it because no one challenges
it.

To challenge it, here's what you have to do:

1.  Get taxed with an "illegal" tax. This gives you *standing* to
    challenge the legality of the tax. If you aren't actually taxed with
    an illegal tax, you can't challenge the tax in court.
2.  Refuse to pay the tax.
3.  Receive some sort of fine for failing to pay the tax.
4.  Challenge the fine in court, claiming that the tax is illegal.

If they find that the tax is actually not illegal, you will owe the tax,
the fines, and any interest on the tax and the fines.
