*Avoid conflict with Israel?* **THEY WANT CONFLICT WITH ISRAEL!**

It's their stated goal.

Before you ask silly questions like this, you should check out Hamas'
stated goals. They want the complete and total destruction of Israel.

It's even in their chants. "From the river to the sea." The "river" is
the Jordan, the eastern border of Israel. The "sea" is the
Mediterranean, the western border of Israel. That means they want
***ALL*** of Israel to be "free." From who? Israelis. They want a new
caliphate across all of the Middle East, and they can't have it with
those pesky democratic Israelis in the way.
