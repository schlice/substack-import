**Content:** [There are two parts to this answer: Yes, Americans have a
right to know the laws. In a nation of laws, the citizen has not only
the right to know, but the responsibility to educate themselves on the
laws they are required to follow.\
\
However, a lack of knowledge of the law is not an excuse for violating
the law. The same penalties are applied to someone who violates the law
whether they knew the content and meaning of the law or
not.]{.rendered_qtext}
