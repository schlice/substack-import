**What is a good alternative to pepper spray that I can take to school
(high school)?**

Thank you for clarifying that you mean high school.

The answer is "whatever your high school does not already prohibit." And
it's a fair bet that they prohibit quite a lot.

Take a look through the list of items that [[Bryan

posted and see if there is anything in there you might be able to use.
Part of the problem is that any time you use a "something" to defend
yourself, you face civil charges based on your own use of force, even if
you were justified in doing so. So if you spray someone in the eyes with
ammonia cleaner and they go blind, you could be sued for excessive use
of force. You must be really, really careful when using anything to
defend yourself. That's why pepper spray is such a good alternative: it
provides very good stopping power without causing permanent damage to
the target.

But as some of the other answerers hinted to, the fact that you have to
ask this question in the first place is worrisome at best. You're
essentially saying that you do not feel safe in your school, and that's
a problem.

What you *really* need to be doing is taking this feeling to your
school's administration. When the school does not provide a "safe and
nurturing" environment for their students, they have essentially failed
at their mission. It can't just be an environment in which you are
physically safe, but one in which you feel safe.

Talk to your parents and bring this up with the school. If you get no
joy with the school, have your parents help you to take this above the
school's head to the District level. Go as high as you need to in order
to make sure someone addresses your concerns about safety.

If you tried to get relief from the school and they refused to help, my
next best advice is to break the rules and bring pepper spray with you
anyway. That's right, I'm advising you to break the rules. If you are
going to use a self-defense spray, pepper spray is the one to use. It's
powerful enough to stop a high schooler without causing permanent
damage. And rather than facing legal trouble from excessive use of
force, you'll only be facing school disciplinary trouble for bringing a
pepper spray to school. Meh, if the school can't help you feel safe, I'm
sure their punishments are anemic too. Make sure your parents are fully
on board with this, so that when the school calls and says you were
given two weeks of out-of-school suspension for bringing a pepper spray
to school, they won't freak out. But remember, this is only after you've
tried to get the school to fix their problems first and they didn't
listen.

Good luck!
