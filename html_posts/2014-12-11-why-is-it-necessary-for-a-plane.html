**Content:** [It isn\'t \"necessary\" in the fact that the plane will
crash if the wheels aren\'t stopped. But leaving the wheels spinning
creates excess friction on the axle, especially when the wheel is
rotated 90 degrees sideways. So braking the wheels reduces the
wear-and-tear on the axles and hubs of the wheels. It also creates
unnecessary noise and vibration inside the aircraft when the wheels
continue to spin.]{.rendered_qtext}
