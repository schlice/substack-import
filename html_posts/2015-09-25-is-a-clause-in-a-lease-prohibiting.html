**Content:** [The wording you provided from the lease basically says
that your kids can\'t have parties unless you\'re there. As long as you
or any other cosigner on the lease is present, social
gatherings/meetings/parties are permitted.\
\
If your landlord verbally told you that you can\'t have guests, I\'d
point him to the lease and tell him that the lease agreement doesn\'t
prohibit social gatherings or guests. It only specifies that a lease
cosigner be present.\
\
If he\'s trying to add conditions to the lease, I\'d ask him to file an
amendment to the lease agreement so that you have his current conditions
in writing.]{.rendered_qtext}
