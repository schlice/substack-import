<h2>Answer Comment</h2>
<div>

**Content:** [We live in an ordered and free society. We all have
individual rights. We submit that in order to have an ordered society,
there have to be laws that govern our interactions so that your free
exercise of your rights doesn\'t interfere with my free exercise of my
rights.\
\
This means we **voluntarily cede** that control to the government, and
we voluntarily follow laws. Anyone who lives in a civil society must
follow the laws to keep it that way. Disagreements with the laws are, of
course, possible, but that\'s a matter for lawmakers, not an excuse for
lawlessness.\
\
Every law is only imposed on those willing to live in a free society,
which involves compliance with the law.]{.rendered_qtext}
