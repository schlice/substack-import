**Content:** [You must be prepared to give real, honest information. The
department will respond in kind.\
\
You will be seated in an interview room with someone from the
department. It may be an officer, it may be a civilian in HR. Each
department is different, and depending on why you are filing a report, a
different person from the department will take your statement. You will
have to give your real name, address, phone number, and (in many cases)
Social Security number or driver\'s license number. These must be real.
Failing to give real information (anywhere during the process) leaves
you open to charges of filing a false report.\
\
You will be read your Miranda rights and you will be advised that
anything you do say can be used against you in court. You will also be
advised that you are making an official statement and everything that
you\'re about to say is true and correct to the best of your knowledge,
and that filing a false police report is a crime.\
\
Once the \"administrivia\" is out of the way, they will basically ask
you to recount everything in as much detail as possible. They will
usually ask you to think of the who/what/when/where/why/how of the
incident, and add as much as you can remember. Once your report is
filed, you will be contacted by the investigating group in the
department where you filed the report.\
\
If you are filing a report about officer misconduct, you will be
interviewed by a supervisor, in an interview room. Usually it will be
the officer\'s supervisor, but it can be any supervisor in the
department. If any dash cam or body cam video of the incident exists,
you will review it with the supervisor. Depending on the department,
they may offer to give you a copy of the video on DVD. They may not.
Department policies differ on how non-evidentiary video is treated. If
the supervisor agrees with you that misconduct took place, the
supervisor will take the information to the chain of command, who will
determine any appropriate actions to take. If there was possible
criminal misconduct, the supervisor and the chain of command will take
the evidence to the district attorney, who will decide whether or not
charges will be pressed. If there are no charges filed by the DA\'s
office, the chain of command will proceed with its own internal
disciplinary process.\
\
Be aware that you do not have a right to know what happened to the
officer. You can know that the chain of command received your report and
is determining appropriate actions to take, but what those actions are
is a matter of internal department procedure, and the officer\'s privacy
and confidentiality of his training and disciplinary records is taken
seriously.\
\
If you are filing a report about something other than police misconduct,
the appropriate reviewing agency will get back to you to let you know
what they\'ve done with your report.\
\
In any case, you can always call the department to ask them what the
status of the report is and who owns that status.]{.rendered_qtext}
