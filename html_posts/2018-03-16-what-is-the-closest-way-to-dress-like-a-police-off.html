**What is the closest way to dress like a police officer without it
being illegal?**

As with all legal answers, the actual answer is "it depends."

In the United States, your particular choice of fashion is protected by
your First Amendment freedom of expression. Want to dress like a
military vet? Want to dress like a cop? Go ahead. You can even slap on a
fake(ish) badge and a plastic gun if you like.

The **line** (because there's always a line between what is acceptable
and what is not) in most jurisdictions:

- when you start *doing the job* of the person you are dressed as
  without being lawfully appointed or licensed into that job
- when you attempt to profit or extract some monetary gain from your
  outfit

The first bullet should be fairly obvious. You can dress like a doctor,
but as soon as you start treating patients, you are practicing medicine
without a license and you can go to jail. Similarly, you can dress like
a cop, but as soon as you pull someone over in your car, you are
impersonating a peace officer and you can similarly go to jail.

The second bullet should also be fairly self-explanatory. Let's say you
dress in full military garb. Perfectly legal. But as soon as you try to
get a 10% military discount at Starbuck's, you're guilty of theft of
service.

Of course, local laws may vary, check your local laws before dressing as
your favorite cop, your mileage may vary, not available in all
locations, side effects may include nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, hair
loss, etc.
