I'm going to take a guess and say that you haven't told her, in no
uncertain terms, that you no longer want to communicate with her. That's
okay, you are not obligated to.

But if you haven't made your communication preferences known, how do you
expect anyone to abide by them? In other words, *it's difficult to
expect someone to do something you haven't told them you want.*

So tell her that you appreciate her outreach but you really aren't
interested in communicating with her any longer, as you've both already
moved on.

If she doesn't stop, block her number.
