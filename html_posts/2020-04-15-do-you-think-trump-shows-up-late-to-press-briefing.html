**Do you think Trump shows up late to press briefings to demonstrate his
power?**

No.

Trump shows up late to press briefings because his last meeting ran
long.

And if you think that there's enough flexibility in the President's
schedule that he can delay going into a briefing to "demonstrate his
power," you've never seen the true operations of the White House in
action.

He doesn't have gobs of time just waiting for him. He doesn't sit around
with nothing to do in between meetings.

His calendar is **full**, from start to finish. And he frequently works
in his off-time. He has to build off-time into his schedule. By the way,
when you have to build free time into your daily schedule, you know you
have a busy job.

Every minute of the day is meticulously scheduled. There is no time
available to casually show up late just to prove you're the man in
charge. I think he's already pretty effectively done that.
