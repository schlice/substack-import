The thought problem goes like this:

*If Hitler, on his death bed, mere moments before he died, had a true
epiphany and was truly repentant for what he had done and asked God for
forgiveness, would he be saved? Would he be in Heaven right now?*

As you work through the thought problem, you may say, "Hitler was so bad
during his life, he killed so many (or so many died at his command) that
there is no way he could be saved."

But then you ask, what makes someone "saved?" When is someone truly
saved? At what point?

Christian theology teaches that someone who truly repents and accepts
Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior, and asks for forgiveness and
salvation, will have that granted, right then and there.

Even Hitler, on his deathbed, could have asked for salvation, and if he
was truly repentant, it would have been given to him. Remember,
salvation is a gift. Gifts are not given with strings attached. Gifts
are offered without request by the receiver. The gift of salvation has
already been bought and paid for through Christ's death and
resurrection. All you have to do is take it.

But don't wait too long. The gift offer may never expire, but I'd hate
for you to be the person who waits too long to accept the gift. If
you're already dead, you're going to have a hard time accepting that
gift.

What if you are offered the gift, reject it, but later come to your
senses and realize you were wrong about what that gift actually meant,
or what it could mean for your life or your future? Will you still be
saved? Again, we teach that yes, you can be, if you have truly changed
in your heart. But what if you live your life *knowing that the gift is
there, ready to be accepted,* you know what it means and what it will do
for you, and you believe it to be true, and you then *willingly*
*reject* it? How are you living your life at that point? Are you living
like a person who is saved? Do you think this is what God had in mind
when He gave you free will?

So while it's not a "one-time offer," once you *know* that the gift is
there and what it means and you *choose* not to accept it, aren't you
living your life knowing that salvation is being offered to you and you
are consciously turning your back on it, choosing to not accept it? If
you were giving someone a gift and they chose to not accept your gift,
how would that make you feel? Do you think God feels any better about
your conscious decision? Do you think He does not *grieve* for you? He
*wants* this for you, but He has also bestowed free will on you. He
allows you to make your own decisions, including whether or not to
accept His gift of salvation, and then live like a person who has been
saved.
