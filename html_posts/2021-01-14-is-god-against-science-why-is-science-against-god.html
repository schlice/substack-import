**Is GOD against Science? Why is Science against GOD?**

God is not against science. God IS science. God created the universe and
everything in it. So studying the universe is studying God's creation.

In fact, it was in order to enhance the study of God that modern science
developed.

These early Christian "scientists" tried to prove that the Christian God
was, in fact, the author of the universe by using scientific inquiry to
understand it. Indeed, early scientists like Descartes, Copernicus,
Galileo and Mendel actually created the foundation of the scientific
method in order to prove that God created the universe, and not some
pagan gods being bandied about during their time.

To wit: if science originally existed to prove God's existence, how can
science be against God?

The truth is that science is not against God. ***Scientists*** are
against God.

Remember the story of the Tower of Babel from the Bible? Man became
quite haughty in his existence, believing that he had mastered the
universe. Man decided that he could be "like God" by building a tower to
the heavens so that he could congregate with the gods.

That same level of self-aggrandization has happened with modern
scientists. Science has become, essentially, its own religion. You can
call it "scienceism." Scienceism believes that it understands *pretty
much* everything about how the universe runs, except for the things
that, you know, it doesn't understand. But for all of the things which
still remain unknown, Scienceism believes that it is only a matter of
time until science learns these things. Things like "how did DNA evolve"
and "how did organisms reproduce before DNA" and "what existed before
the Big Bang" and "how did an amoral universe create beings imbued with
moral sense from birth." They have ***faith*** that science will learn
the answers to these questions, in time. This is the foundation of the
religion of Scienceism.

The answer, therefore, is not that science is *against God*. Science has
created its own religion. In other words, for the Scienceists, science
has *supplanted* God.
