**No.**

Rights are exactly that. They are the opposite of **privileges** in that
they do not require action of any kind in order to gain them.

**Rights** are granted based on membership in a group. Human rights are
granted because of membership in a particular group: the human race.
Therefore, human rights are universal to all humans simply by *being
human*.

**Privileges**, on the other hand, are *granted* by an entity, be that a
government or a company (i.e. the privilege to drive granted by the
state, or the privilege to enter a club based on membership). You
absolutely can be required to pay something or own something in order to
be granted a privilege.
