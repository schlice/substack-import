It's actually pretty simple. There is an [[online
form](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2b8957&url=https://afreserve.com/how-to-join){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="afreserve.com"}]{.qlink_container} you fill out, and a
career adviser will reach out to you to talk further.

If you'd rather call, you can call the Air Force Reserve recruiting
office directly at +1 800--257--1212, and a career adviser will talk to
you about your options.

The Air Force Reserve is open to current military personnel who are
transitioning from active duty, former members of any branch of the U.S.
military, as well as candidates with no prior military experience.

If you have no prior service, you must:

- Be 17 to 38 years old
- Be a U.S. Citizen or legal permanent resident
- Have a high school diploma (or GED with 15 college credits)
- Be in good health

If you meet these minimums, you may be eligible to join the Reserves.
