**Content:** [Laws do not dictate morals or ethics. Morals can dictate
law, but laws based on morality often make bad law. Morality is borne of
the whole of society, so what is morally or ethically acceptable to one
may not be ethically acceptable to another.\
\
For some, all illegal actions are unethical. Some people may never break
the law even if the situation dictated that a law may need to be broken
in order to fulfill an ethical requirement. Their own moral code tells
them that it is wrong to break the law in any situation, so therefore,
for them, their ethical code is violated every time the law is broken.
Others will break the law if it is morally right to do so in that
situation, because following one\'s moral and ethical code is more
important than following the law at that particular moment. In order for
this to happen, your personal moral code has to tell you that the law is
not all-encompassing; the law is breakable if it meets a moral
imperative.\
\
The example that was given was speeding (or safely bypassing a red light
after coming to a full and complete stop and clearing for cross-traffic,
which I may have done once or twice in my life) when racing to the
emergency room with a critically ill or injured person (I have
transported one of each in my lifetime). Can you be cited for breaking
the law? Yes, absolutely. The law does not provide exceptions for
speeding to a hospital. But ethically, it\'s the right thing to do to
save someone\'s life, so when you break the law, you accept the
consequences of doing so.\
\
If ethically, you can accept the consequences of breaking the law in
order to meet a moral imperative, then the morality wins. For those who
are guided by a solid moral compass, these decisions, while painful to
make, can be made easily.\
\
Concealing a handgun on school property is one that would probably evoke
more emotional responses from people. It is currently illegal for anyone
with a concealed handgun permit to conceal their weapon in a school. But
that\'s exactly what the \"active shooter\" wants: a place where no one
is armed and they can kill as many people as possible before they are
killed or kill themselves (active shooters are mentally unstable and
have severely impaired judgement). If I carried my concealed handgun
into a school and was able to stop an active shooter bent on killing as
many people as he could, would I be wrong? Legally, I would be
absolutely wrong for concealing my handgun on school property. But
morally, I would have saved potentially many lives by breaking the law.
I would have to accept the consequences of breaking the law in order to
meet a moral imperative. Some would tell me that the moral imperative
doesn\'t matter; breaking the law is unethical, period. Others would say
that you do what you must to meet the moral imperative and you accept
the consequences. It would be up to a judge to determine whether or not
the moral imperative was enough of a mitigating circumstance to overcome
the violation of the law. It may not, it may simply provide for a lesser
consequence. But I would be responsible for my own actions and the
consequences of those actions.\
\
This is the quandary we face when trying to balance following the law
(which we know is important for a properly-functioning society) and
following our moral and ethical code.]{.rendered_qtext}
