**Is it possible to provide untested (therefore illegal) methods of
holistic health care to cure disease, by using a waiver to remove burden
of legal liability?**

Actually, the physician faces more legal liability for potential
mistakes than the holistic practitioner.

Now let's correct a misunderstanding. You said "untested (therefore
illegal)" and that is incorrect.

**Untested does not equal illegal.**

In the United States, if a holistic health provider wants to sell me oil
of oregano for my "leaky gut" he can do so. But it's outside of the
realm of regulated Western medicine, and the diagnosis and treatment
plan is not approved by the American Medical Association, and the
supplement is not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.

That does not equate to "illegal." It equates to "untested by a
government-approved body" and therefore not able to print on a bottle
that it treats or cures any specific disease or condition. That's the
only thing that would be illegal.

Basically, if you believe that the only way you can stay safe is to have
AMA-approved doctors prescribing you (using a Federally-protected
prescription) a drug which has been approved by the FDA to treat the
condition diagnosed by the AMA-approved doctor, then holistics is not
for you.

The downside, of course, is that you could get in bed with a "snake oil
salesman." He may be selling you a supplement which hasn't been tested,
hasn't been proven to actually help your condition, and may possibly
contribute to making you worse. You have far fewer legal protections
when dealing with unlicensed holistic therapists.

But there is far less legal liability in going to a holistic doctor. You
do so knowing that it might help, or it might not. On the outside, it
might make you worse. That's all on you, and you generally do sign a
waiver indicating that the diagnoses are not endorsed by the AMA and the
supplements are not regulated by the FDA and at the outset it could make
you worse. When you visit a licensed, regulated physician in the United
States, you expect that the treatment will help you, not make you worse,
and the physician can be held liable if his treatment makes you worse.
