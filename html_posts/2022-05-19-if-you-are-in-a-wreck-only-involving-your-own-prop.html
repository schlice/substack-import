So if your accident caused no damage to property other than your car (so
like, for example, let's say you drove into a drainage ditch at the side
of the road and damaged your own car but that's it) and no one else was
injured, you would not have to report that.

If there was damage to property and you *didn't* report it and you just
left, you could be charged with leaving the scene of an accident, so
don't do that.
