Everyone should have to pay taxes. No one should not have to pay taxes.
That said, laws are designed so that you can have write-offs. No one is
alleging that Trump did anything illegal. They're simply alleging that
if Trump is such a master businessman, how did he incur a \$916 million
loss?

We all know that Trump took a \$916 million loss in 1995. In 1995, the
New York Times even reported on it.

One billion in the red by 1991, and he has recovered to be what he is
now. That\'s a pretty significant comeback, and the Times was writing
about it in 1995. They called him "the Comeback Kid," and it prompted
him to write his book, "The Art of the Comeback."

Again, no one is alleging that Trump did anything illegal. The IRS is
not alleging that Trump violated federal tax law. People are simply
shocked to find out that Trump took a \$916 million loss in 1995. It's
hard to imagine because we don't think in terms of numbers that big.
Also, the New York Times and President and Mrs. Clinton have used the
same provision in the tax laws as Trump has. Nothing to see here.

What really surprises me is that **the media (the New York Times, to be
precise) does something so** ***illegal*** **and no one cares.**

It just makes me laugh. Does anyone remember the emails from the
University of East Anglia which showed that global warming was a hoax?
The New York Times refused to publish the emails because they were the
fruits of a hack, and since hacks are illegal, it would be unethical to
publish the emails.

But now, someone drops a manila envelope with three pages of Trump tax
returns (p.s. it was an IRS employee) on the Times' front door and they
happily publish it, even though they were obtained **illegally**. Just
ask Trump; he never agreed to release those tax returns. But because it
benefits the Democrats, the Times jumps to publish them.

There's no more pretense; this is literally the most corrupt media we
have ever seen.
