is, as ever, spot on with her comments. There is nothing "predictable"
about this disease.

I had "double vision" as your friend calls it. It's actually one of the
most common first symptoms of MS, [[optic
neuritis](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=185d9b&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optic_neuritis){.external_link

own, even without steroids, within a few weeks to a few months. Since
that bout of ON, I've never had another relapse on that eye. And I've
been diagnosed for more than 10 years.

I started on Copaxone within six months of my initial bout of ON. It
worked for seven years, until it stopped. I experienced my next symptom:
weakness on the right side of my body. My MRI confirmed the new lesions
on the left side of my brain, right where you'd expect them. So I
switched medications, and I've been stable since then.

MS is like flying a plane in many respects. As you go along, you measure
your location with respect to your flight path. When you get off-course,
you make a course adjustment, changing your heading ever so slightly so
that you get back on course. These minor course corrections continue
throughout the entire journey, keeping you on track. MS is very much
like that. We monitor our progression throughout our lives, and as we
find ourselves drifting off course, we make minor corrections. Sometimes
we hit a big bump and have to make a major correction, but we try to
keep ourselves on course as much as possible.
