**Content:** [I certainly hope not, because I take them for my MS.\
\
I suppose it comes down to how the fatty acids are \"processed.\" If the
processing changes the nature of the oils, then their incorporation in
the body could create an inflammatory molecule, rather than an
anti-inflammatory molecule, which would clearly be counterproductive.\
\
I would think that most \"cold-pressed\" fish oils are not similarly
compromised in terms of molecular structure. Make sure you buy a
reputable brand of fish/krill oil. Don\'t buy a generic brand just
because it\'s cheaper. The oil is more expensive because they use the
right process to extract it, to preserve the oil in its most natural
state.]{.rendered_qtext}
