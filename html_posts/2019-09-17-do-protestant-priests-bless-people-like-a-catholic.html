**Do Protestant priests bless people like a Catholic Priest will?**

First of all, Protestants in general do not have "priests." They follow
the Bible much more closely in this regard, and they have positions as
you'd find in 1 Timothy, such as "elders" and "deacons." Deacons in
Protestant churches would be closer to Pastors today. Catholics have the
Magisterium, which includes priests, bishops, cardinals, and the Pope.

Anyway, more accurately asked, **do Protestant pastors bless people?**

Kinda.

Protestant pastors follow the traditions in the Bible and will perform
the "[[laying on of
hands](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6fb1a7&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_laying_on_of_hands){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}" (Acts 6:5--6) in order
to bless people who are leaving on missions, or who are undertaking some
other spiritual calling. The laying on of hands also tends to be a more
community-oriented function; Protestants tend to do this as a community
rather than by themselves.

They certainly don't bless people with the regularity that Catholic
priests would bless people.
