Rather than link these two answers, it makes more sense for me to just
quote this question:

[[Prisons and Prison Life: What are some last meals ordered by
inmates?](https://www.quora.com/Prisons-and-Prison-Life-What-are-some-last-meals-ordered-by-inmates)]{.qlink_container}

These are some examples of last meals ordered by inmates. As you can
see, some of them are fairly extravagant, and some are fairly basic.

In nearly all cases, the prison attempts to comply with the "last
wishes" of the prisoners, but in all cases, the rules for executions are
exceedingly well detailed, including the details about last meals.

Of course, it varies by state (and sometimes by prison), but in general,
there aren't limits to what a convict can order, so long as it is within
reason. Requesting Kobe beef *from Japan* might be unreasonable for a US
prisoner, but simply requesting Kobe beef that you can get from your
local specialty butcher might be a more reasonable request.
