**How has treatment for Multiple sclerosis changed over the past 10
years?**

Treatments for MS have changed more in the last 10 (and even 20) years
than they have in the previous 200 years.

The disease itself was officially identified and given a name in 1868,
but its existence was documented long before that. St. Liduina of
Schiedam is said to have had MS[\[1\]](#MMZbT){#cite-MMZbT
.citation_link}, and this was in 1396. Her symptoms were documented in
her biography, written after her death in 1433, and include relapses and
remissions. Her bones were discovered in the 1970s and show signs of
limited mobility in her right arm and her legs, but whether or not it
was actually MS is debatable.

From that point through the late 20th century, treatment of MS was
limited to management of the symptoms. However, the treatment options
literally exploded in the 1990s. The 90s are known as the "drug
explosion" decade.[\[2\]](#fIfGf){#cite-fIfGf .citation_link}
Interferon, an injectable drug to treat cancer, was approved for the
treatment of MS in the early and mid 90s. For the first time since the
1800s, we could actually *alter the course* of the disease by actually
addressing the disease itself, and not just its symptoms. We were no
longer slaves to symptoms. This was **revolutionary** in the treatment
of the disease.

Since then, our treatments have become more specific, more targeted, and
more effective. Our medicines have continued to improve efficacy, and
routes of administration have improved from injection-only therapies to
infusion and most recently, oral administration.

Since the 90s, our treatments have been "evolutionary" instead of
"revolutionary." We continue to improve our treatments so that they more
effectively slow down the progression of the disease, reduce the
severity and duration of relapses, and increase the amount of time
between relapses.

I have often said that there is no better time in history to get MS than
right now. I knew of people with MS as a child in the 80s, and it wasn't
pretty. It was going to progress, and there was nothing we could do to
stop or slow down the juggernaut that was MS, *but there is today*.

We've also made great strides in understanding the disease and its
progression, and our diagnostic tools have improved immensely, but that
elusive "cause" is still missing. However, our therapies have improved
so much that lifespans for people with MS, who take an approved therapy
drug, have nearly matched lifespans of those without MS.
