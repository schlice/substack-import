**Did Trump sign his executive order in Charlotte in order to have
taxpayers not campaign funds pay for it?**

Indeed, the administration was asked about why Trump came to North
Carolina to sign the executive order, since he combined a campaign stop
with the signing. Some thought Trump was using the EO signing to make it
an official trip (paid by taxpayers) to cover the costs rather than
having the campaign pay for the trip.

It's certainly possible, but it's highly unlikely.
