What do you do? Nothing.

When you need to do something is when you get a real violation letter
from the real HOA, who you can actually contact and actually talk to
about whatever rule they are accusing you of violating.

Which, by the way, is how you determine whether or not a letter from the
HOA is real. Contact them. If they sent it, they'll have record of it,
and they will be able to discuss it with you.

Remember, HOAs aren't about punishing past deeds. They're simply about
*compliance*. So if you come into compliance, you're good. So if it's a
real letter, find out what behavior is violative, and stop it. If it's
vague accusations about some nuisance behavior, ignore it. They would
never be so bold as to try to fine you for behavior that they did not
have photographic evidence of you committing, because it would be too
easy for you to defend against in court, and they don't want to spend
any money on their lawyers.

And just as a piece of general life advice, if your roommates have
stooped to creating fake HOA letters about you, maybe it's time to find
better roommates.
