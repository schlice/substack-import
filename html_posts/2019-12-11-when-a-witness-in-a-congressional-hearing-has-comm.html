**When a witness in a Congressional hearing has committed wilful
perjury, what is required to ensure that witness is punished if the
chairman is biased? Can the chairman be sanctioned?**

When a witness in a Congressional hearing has committed willful perjury,
the Congress must bring the evidence to the US Attorney's Office, who
will file charges of Lying to Congress, which is a Federal crime.

Whether or not Congress presses charges is dubious; not everyone who
lies to Congress is charged with Lying to Congress. In fact, people seem
to lie to Congress with great regularity.

The Chairman cannot be sanctioned when a witness lies. The lie is all on
the witness. Charges are not required, so the Chairman is not derelict
in his duty if he does not press charges.
