It's not easy, but the process is similar for a recruited athlete as
well as a non-recruited athlete. Even recruited athletes have to go
through this process (although the Academy's acceptance rate may be
somewhat different for recruited athletes than it is for others).
Approximately 40% of cadets are recruited athletes for one of the
Academy\'s 27 NCAA Division I teams. On average, 34% of student-athletes
receive athletic preference during acceptance.

As far as USAFA's general acceptance rate (11%), it's roughly on par
with a school like Georgetown (12%). So you need to be very academically
qualified to go. The average high school GPA of students who are
accepted is 3.78, and as of the last class who entered, they averaged in
the top three percent of their high school classes. Strong performance
in your high school core classes (i.e. strong understanding of algebra)
is more important than exposure to college-level curriculum (i.e.
calculus).

But what makes it *really* challenging is that in addition to USAFA
acceptance, you need a *nomination*. Even recruited athletes need
nominations. In order to attend a Service Academy, you have to be
nominated by a member of the House of Representatives, a Senator, the
Vice President, or (in special cases) the President. The method with the
least amount of competition is your Representative for your
Congressional District. When I was nominated, there were roughly 100
students from my district who also applied. You had to go in front of a
Nomination Board assembled by the Representative, and you had to put a
package together for that Board, which was fairly similar to the
application to USAFA: academic transcripts, letters of recommendation,
essays discussing extracurriculars, etc.

The Academy (and the Nominating Board) uses the "whole person" standard.
Being talented in just one area is not enough. You need to show some
talent in all areas: academic, athletic, community service, etc. Your
letters of recommendation should span all of those areas. So just having
a high GPA but never participating in sports or doing any work in the
community is not going to cut it.
