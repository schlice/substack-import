**Content:** [Since the base is located on soil within a city, county,
and state, those entities have jurisdiction on the base. It\'s called
concurrent jurisdiction, and it means that the local police as well as
the military police, both have jurisdiction. However, the local police
usually defer to the military police on matters which occur on a
military base.\
\
Legally, because of concurrent jurisdiction, since both the state and
the Federal government have jurisdiction, someone committing a crime on
a base can be charged twice, once by the base and once by the locals. He
can be convicted twice, and serve two separate sentences, and this is
not covered by the \"double jeopardy\" rule where you can\'t be
convicted for the same crime twice. In this case, you can. It\'s the
only loophole in the \"double jeopardy\" rule, but it would only be
exercised when something really serious happened.]{.rendered_qtext}
