<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Since the base is located on soil within a city, county,<br>and state, those entities have jurisdiction on the base. It\'s called<br>concurrent jurisdiction, and it means that the local police as well as<br>the military police, both have jurisdiction. However, the local police<br>usually defer to the military police on matters which occur on a<br>military base.\<br>\<br>Legally, because of concurrent jurisdiction, since both the state and<br>the Federal government have jurisdiction, someone committing a crime on<br>a base can be charged twice, once by the base and once by the locals. He<br>can be convicted twice, and serve two separate sentences, and this is<br>not covered by the \"double jeopardy\" rule where you can\'t be<br>convicted for the same crime twice. In this case, you can. It\'s the<br>only loophole in the \"double jeopardy\" rule, but it would only be<br>exercised when something really serious happened.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
