In 100% of mass shootings, the gun stopped firing when the person
holding it stopped pulling the trigger. When they put the gun down, it
did not continue shooting anyone.

America has had a Second Amendment for 231 years, but mass shootings for
only the past 30 or so.

This should show you that the gun is not the problem, the person pulling
the trigger is. To that end, mental health in the United States is
woefully pathetic and needs a major overhaul.

Original question:

Is Donny Jr. mentally ill when he declares that guns are not responsible
for the Uvalde mass shooting? Will he blame fire ants, wild boars, or
flying pigs as being the culprits?
