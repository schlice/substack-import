I think the 18-wheeler is infinitely more difficult than "flying" a
Cessna.

I think "landing" a Cessna is more difficult than driving an 18-wheeler.

So in order of difficulty, based on how much instruction one would need
to accomplish each task:

- Flying a Cessna straight and level
- Performing a turn or a climb or descent in a Cessna.
- Driving an 18-wheeler, meaning starting, stopping, and making it move,
  including a gear change or two.
- Landing a Cessna.
