**If an atheist can have a bigger positive impact on the world than a
Christian, doesn\'t that disprove God?**

Well let's try to follow that logic and we'll see where the gaps are.

1.  An atheist has a bigger positive impact on the world than a
    Christian.
2.  ???
3.  Therefore, God does not exist.

So let's see if we can address some of these issues.

For statement 1 (an atheist has a bigger positive impact on the world
than a Christian), which atheist? Which Christian? There are lots of
atheists, and there are lots of Christians. Is it a specific atheist who
has this bigger positive impact on the world than a specific Christian?

And how do you quantify "bigger positive impact on the world?" By whose
standard? How do you measure who has a bigger positive impact?

Once you determine how you're going to quantify "bigger positive impact
on the world," to have some meaningful logical statement in statement 2,
you must show the Christian doctrine (presumably from the Christian
Bible) which states that in order to prove that God exists, all
Christians must have the biggest positive impact on the world, bigger
than anyone else in existence.

In fact, Christianity says ***exactly the opposite***. It says that the
world will reject Christians. The world will hate them. And looking at
modern culture and history, that has most definitely been true.

From the Bible, the words of Jesus:

> "If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. If you
> belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do
> not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That
> is why the world hates you. Remember what I told you: 'A servant is
> not greater than his master.' If they persecuted me, they will
> persecute you also. If they obeyed my teaching, they will obey yours
> also. They will treat you this way because of my name, for they do not
> know the one who sent me. If I had not come and spoken to them, they
> would not be guilty of sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.
> Whoever hates me hates my Father as well. If I had not done among them
> the works no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin. As it is,
> they have seen, and yet they have hated both me and my Father. But
> this is to fulfill what is written in their Law: 'They hated me
> without reason.'" John 15:18--25 NIV

The world rejected Jesus (they crucified him), so the world similarly
rejects and hates Christians as well.

So it's entirely possible that a Christian won't have a bigger impact on
the world than an atheist.

And none of that disproves God's existence.
