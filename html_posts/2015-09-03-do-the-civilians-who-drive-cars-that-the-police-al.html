**Content:** [I have loved the Dodge Charger since I was little. I have
always wanted a Charger. That will probably be my mid-life crisis car.\
\
When the police started adopting the Charger, I told my youngest son (a
gear head himself) that if I was ever going to be pulled over, I wanted
it to be a Charger.\
\
The fact is, I liked the Charger long before it was used as a police
vehicle, and I\'ll still like it long after police departments stop
using it.\
\
I often rent Impalas. I used to own at least one Explorer.\
\
The question you asked was do people who drive these cars feel more
respect or empowerment? I don\'t think so. For most of us, even an
unmarked police car is easy to spot: the aerials on the roof, the strobe
lights on the rear deck, the push bar on the front of the car, the dark
tinted windows, etc. I also know that police in my area have a general
agreement to not perform routine traffic duty in unmarked cars. Now, if
an officer in an unmarked car saw you do something egregious, they\'d
stop you, even in an unmarked car. I watched this happen. My neighbor
(who at the time was a Sheriff\'s Detective) was driving his unmarked
County car a few cars ahead of me, when a nominee for the Darwin Awards
decided he didn\'t want to wait for the red light to change, so he
rolled up on the shoulder, bypassing all the traffic (and my neighbor)
and proceeded through the light. My neighbor also pulled out of traffic,
the same way the Darwin Award nominee did, turned on his lights, and
stopped the vehicle. What he likely did was to call a marked unit to
assist (I was already through the light at that point), but he could
have just as easily written the citation himself.\
\
For the most part, that doesn\'t happen.\
\
So I don\'t really look at unmarked cars as something I need to be
worried about, and drivers of similar models are probably much more
thrilled at the fact that they own a car that is so popular amongst so
many groups.]{.rendered_qtext}
