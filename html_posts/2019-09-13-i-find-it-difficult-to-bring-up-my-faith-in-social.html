**I find it difficult to bring up my faith in social situations which I
feel bad about. How do I do it without making others uncomfortable or
should I just do it unapologetically?**

You can live by faith without having to ever say a single word about it.

Mahatma Gandhi said, "Be the example you want to see in the world." So
instead of proselytizing, you can instead live the life that is an
example of the kind of behavior that does work.

You don't have to accuse anyone of anything. You don't have to open any
religious text. You don't have to quote verses from the Bible. You
simply have to live the example taught by your faith in a gentle, loving
way. That's it.

Being unapologetic and "preachy" just makes you come off like a jerk,
and turns people away from your faith instead of guiding them towards
it.

Remember too that when it comes to witnessing and bringing people to the
faith, it is God that does the real work of conversion. You simply guide
people to the right place and get them in the right frame of mind to be
receptive to such work. You don't actually convert people or change
their hearts. Only God has that kind of power.

The best way you can get people into the right frame of mind is by using
your own life as an example. Live your life in a way that people will
want to know what makes you so hopeful for the future. Be the example
you want to see in the world.

Then when people ask you what your source of hope is, ***then*** can you
start to discuss your faith.
