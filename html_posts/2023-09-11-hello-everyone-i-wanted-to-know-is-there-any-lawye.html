You have to explain what "harassment" is. In Florida, harassment has a
specific legal definition.

> Fl. Stat. 784.048 Stalking; definitions; penalties.--- (1) As used in
> this section, the term: (a) "Harass" means **to engage in a course of
> conduct directed at a specific person which causes substantial
> emotional distress to that person and serves no legitimate purpose**.

So while the HOA fulfilling its duty may cause you substantial emotional
distress, in order to qualify as harassment, what the HOA is doing must
serve no legitimate purpose.

If the HOA can claim that their actions are in furtherance of the
execution of their duties, and those duties are found to be lawful, it's
unlikely you will prevail in a harassment lawsuit.

But if you really believe you have a case for harassment, contact a real
estate attorney in your jurisdiction who specializes in HOA law. That
would be the correct way to not only find out if what you are
experiencing is actual harassment under Florida law, but what you can do
about it.
