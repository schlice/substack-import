It is, but it shouldn\'t.

Senators are not jurors. They are not impartial. They are partisan
actors, all of them, on both sides, voting in the interest of their
constituents. No one in that Senate chamber is, or can be, impartial.

They can, at least, give the evidence a thorough review as it is
presented by the House. They should swear to do that, not to be fair and
impartial. They should not swear to that, since there is no way they can
logically keep that oath.
