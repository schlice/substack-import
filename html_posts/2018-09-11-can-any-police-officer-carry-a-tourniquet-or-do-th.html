**Can any police officer carry a tourniquet, or do they need training?**

Every police officer carries multiple tourniquets. They usually have
shoes with laces (there's a tourniquet). They usually wear a belt
(there's another tourniquet). And since they get first aid training in
the police academy, they usually have a specialized tourniquet in their
first aid kits. The law only requires training on the items carried on
their duty belts, but they do get first aid training.

Everyone, not just police officers, should know what a tourniquet is,
when to use it, how to use it, and what items from which they can
fashion a tourniquet. You don't need to carry a specialized tourniquet,
although you can.
