First of all, don't panic.

Second, if any of you had actually cared to read the order itself, you'd
have seen that the "buyout offer" actually doesn't lay them off.

*What? But the talking heads on the pretty light box keep telling me
that it does!?!?!?!*

Nope. Read more carefully. The plan actually keeps them on as employees
until September 30th, but removes their work responsibilities. It
essentially puts them on a paid furlough. After that time, they will be
disenrolled from the employee roster. The memo also states that this
plan is "subject to the availability of appropriations" dictated by
Congress, which must approve a new budget by the time the current one
expires on March 14.

And there's the rub.

If the government doesn't have funding to continue operating (or, in
other words, if Congress doesn't approve a federal budget on time), then
*no one gets paid,* including furloughed employees. But some duplicitous
attorneys have used a federal judge to successfully interrupt the plan,
claiming that because the memo says they'll be paid through September
30, that may not happen since the plan is subject to Congress passing a
budget, so the "buyout" plan must be paused.

But there are two problems with their argument:

1.  The memo already indicates this fact
2.  If the employees stay and Congress doesn't pass a budget, *no one*
    gets paid.

And the more glaring problem: all throughout human history, in nearly
every endeavor from school assignments to family vacations to work
projects, people have a tendency to put the work off until closer to the
deadline. Because a federal judge has paused the deadline, fewer people
are going to take the deal, because the deadline is indeterminate.

But if they don't take the deal, and the deadline for doing so
*expires*, then they risk losing their jobs due to restructuring and
cuts, and if they are fired due to that workforce reduction, they leave
with *nothing*.

It's a gamble. Personally, I'd rather have a "guaranteed" salary through
September 30 and have all that time to find a new job rather than
getting WFR'd and have nothing.
