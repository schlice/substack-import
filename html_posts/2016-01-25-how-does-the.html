\"Well-regulated\" does not mean \"an abundance of good laws and
regulation.\"

Think of regulation in terms of a grandfather clock. A
\"well-regulated\" grandfather clock will keep time accurately for
years.

Similarly, a \"well-regulated\" militia has all of the proper equipment,
in good working order, ready to be used at any time. The Virginia Plan
originally called for inspections of militias on a regular basis to
ensure their equipment (i.e. their guns) were \"well-regulated.\" This
means \"in good regulation\" or \"in good working order.\"
