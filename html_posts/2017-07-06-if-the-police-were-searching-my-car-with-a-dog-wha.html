**TL;DR: There are virtually no limits to where they can look once the
dog is legally searching the car.**

The police don't need reasonable suspicion to use the dog on the outside
of the car, so probable cause or consent are not required. If the dog
hits, this constitutes probable cause to search the vehicle. The
reasoning is that the dog only hits on illegal items, which you do not
have a right to possess, and therefore the 4th Amendment does not apply.

What they *cannot* do is detain you for longer than the normal amount of
time it takes to conduct a traffic stop in order to bring in a drug dog
to establish probable cause.

Nevertheless, if they already established probable cause (or they have
your consent) and they are searching your car with a drug dog, and the
dog hits on a trim panel, they can look behind that trim panel. If the
dog hits under a seat, they can take that seat out and search. If the
dog hits on your headliner, they can take down your headliner. At that
point, wherever the dog hits is fair game.

The caveat: the place where they look must reasonably be able to contain
the object for which consent was given to search. With drugs, they can
be concealed anywhere within the car, so the whole car is fair game.

For example (a poor one, but I'm trying to make a point), if they were
searching for a stolen baseball bat, they couldn't open the glove box to
do it, even if the "baseball bat sniffing dog" hit on the glove box,
because it can't possibly contain a baseball bat.
