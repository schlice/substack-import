I'll skip "laws which are elitist" because "elitist" is an opinion.
We'll focus on laws which may "reduce access to guns for the poor."

Any gun law that requires any outlay of money in order to access guns
reduces access to guns for the poor.

For example, let's say you make a law that says you have to have a
permit to own a gun. But to get that permit, you need to pay a permit
fee, an administrative fee, a background check fee, and you need a
training class (which you also pay for). "No big deal," you think, "guns
are pretty dang expensive; if you can afford a gun, you can afford the
administrative fees to get the permit."

What if your gun is gifted to you? You would now have to lay out all
that money (which many not seem like a big deal to you), which may be
too much for a poor person to lay out. Therefore, you are *de facto*
restricting guns from the poor. The 14th Amendment says that laws must
apply equally to all citizens. If a law favors the rich, it's in
violation of the 14th.
