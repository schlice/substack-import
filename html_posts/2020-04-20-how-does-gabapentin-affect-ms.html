**How Does \"Gabapentin\" affects for MS?**

Gabapentin does not affect MS. It does not alter the disease process. It
does not reduce the time between relapses, and it does not reduce the
severity or duration of a relapse.

What Gabapentin does is to manage a possible symptom of the disease, and
no, it's not seizures. It's highly unlikely that an MS patient would be
suffering seizures as part of his disease.

Gabapentin is an *anticonvulsant*. It was originally used in epilepsy to
control seizures. The downside to Gabapentin was that it was not
long-acting. It is broken down in the body fairly quickly, and new
anticonvulsants have been released (since Gabapentin was approved as an
anticonvulsant) which work much better and control seizures for a much
longer period of the day, so it isn't used much for its on-label primary
use anymore.

Gabapentin has shown some benefit for people who suffer from the "MS
hug," as that is a nerve misfiring issue which sometimes responds
positively to Gabapentin.

However, Gabapentin has one big side effect: *drowsiness*. Gabapentin
makes you tired. It makes you tired quickly, and it clears out of your
body within about four hours. So in some cases, it is effective as a
*sleep aid* when other sleep aids are contraindicated.

Gabapentin also has some fairly complex dosing.

Therefore, make sure you only use Gabapentin exactly as it was
prescribed for you. Do not take more or less of it because you think it
will do something else for you. Always use your medication exactly how
it was prescribed, for exactly what it was prescribed on the label.
