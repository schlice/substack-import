**Content:** [In most cases, state law surrounding CCW will dictate
proper conduct at a traffic stop.\
\
For example, in Colorado, you are required by law to immediately notify
an officer conducting a traffic stop that you are carrying concealed and
you have a permit. You are advised to keep your hands firmly attached to
your steering wheel until the officer tells you how he wants to handle
the stop. You are also required to fully know and understand the law
regarding where and when you can carry.\
\
If you live in a CCW state that does not require immediate notification,
I would only advise the officer that I\'m carrying if I\'m about to put
my hand anywhere near my weapon, or if I\'m asked to get out of the car.
For example, if the officer asked for my license, I might say, \"Before
I get my license, I need to inform you that I have a concealed weapons
permit and I am carrying on my right hip, near my wallet. Is it okay for
me to get my wallet, or should I do something else?\" If I\'m asked to
get out of the car, I\'d say, \"Before I get out of the car, I need to
inform you that I have a concealed weapons permit and I am carrying on
my right hip. How would you like me to proceed?\"\
This sort of slow attention to detail seems annoying, but is crucially
important, because if my concealed weapon inadvertently becomes
\"unconcealed\" during the stop and I didn\'t notify the officer that I
have a permit, he will likely perceive the fact that I am armed to be a
threat, and I\'ll likely end up at gunpoint, something which could have
easily been avoided with *using my words.*\
\
*It\'s not hard. It doesn\'t cost you anything to use your
words.*]{.rendered_qtext}
