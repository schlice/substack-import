I'm sure many respondents said what I'm going to say, but this is my
answer, so I'm giving it.

I would like to see the following:

- Overhaul NICS to allow for full public access. Create a web portal
  where you can input a name and SSN and NICS spits out a YES or NO
  decision with a printable certificate and reference number. The portal
  also works the other direction: input the certificate reference number
  and it displays who the background check was performed against and the
  valid dates of the certificate (6 months is probably an appropriate
  timeframe).
- Along with this overhaul, expand NICS to allow for people suspected of
  terrorism to be flagged when a FFL does the check. Not summarily
  denied, but flagged. If a gun store did the check, the purchase would
  be **delayed** (not denied outright) and the government would be
  alerted that a terror suspect attempted to buy a gun. The government
  would have the *opportunity* to bring a case against that person. If
  they chose not to, the system would still default to approve after
  five business days. We still strongly favor retention of individual
  rights, and we want to ensure that the government cannot enact a *de
  facto* gun ban simply by failing to approve delayed purchases, so we
  will never change the background check to default deny. Dylan Roof's
  case was a mistake on behalf of the government; we do not punish the
  citizens when the government screws up.\
  \
  By the way, the NICS overhaul and the increased investigation
  requirement by FBI and BATFE into these suspected terrorists all
  require lots of dollars. I know how to get the government more
  dollars, but that's an answer to a different question.
- Once the NICS overhaul is complete, require that ALL transfers of
  firearms, through any form (sale, gift, etc) have a certificate and
  reference number to show that the background check was completed.
  Gifting a firearm requires a simple form (no bigger than a half sheet
  of paper) be filled out and included with the gift and the
  certificate. The new owner and the previous owner must retain those
  forms for a minimum of 10 years. Electronic retention is acceptable.
  For purchases, you can now expedite the process and pre-approve
  yourself and bring your certificate in to a gun store to show that you
  are valid. The gun store would check your certificate number to ensure
  validity and then sell you your gun.
- The increased funding for BATFE should cover investigations of
  less-than-honorable FFL gun dealers. If we give them the manpower, we
  must also come down on them and make sure they are revoking licenses
  when dealers fail to do background checks. With the new system in
  place, there should be no reason that a dealer fails to do a check.
  FFLs should know that if BATFE discovers a sale where there was no
  check done, they lose their license, period.
- Require states to issue concealed carry licenses to citizens (i.e.
  "shall issue" laws). Require states to follow a model similar to
  driver's licenses: a nominal fee (which should no longer include
  investigative fees, meaning the government will have to pay for
  investigations), a written and a practical test. Full reciprocity
  between all states. Police can require identification when a gun is
  being carried.
- Get rid of free-fire...er...gun-free zones. If you are licensed, you
  can carry your gun anywhere, except for certain government buildings
  (courthouses, etc).
- Increase penalties for carrying without a license. Harshly increase
  penalties for crimes committed with a gun. Do not allow charges of
  crimes committed with a gun to be plea-bargained away, and I'm also
  leaning towards mandatory minimum sentences for crimes committed with
  a gun. Yes, this will increase the load on the courts, but criminals
  will know that if they are caught committing a crime with a gun, they
  are going to jail, period.
- Legalize marijuana, and de-criminalize most other drug use charges.
  Retain penalties for dealing and transporting illegal drugs. Divert
  some of the funding for the "war on drugs" to mandatory treatment and
  increased psychological testing and treatment. Reducing drug
  prosecution should reduce crime, reducing the need to use a gun in the
  first place.
