**My husband keeps recording me with his cell phone at home. The police
told him that is harassment and he has to stop. How do I make him
stop?**

This is a tough situation to advise on, because this is your husband.
Granted, he has no right to harass you just because he is married, but
COVID-19 has really shined a light on this problem. People are forced to
be home with each other more than ever, people are losing jobs, and
parents get no breaks from their children. These factors have caused a
spike in violence against women and children since the pandemic started.

All hope is not lost, however.

The first thing we ***must*** say is that if the harassment ever seems
like it is going to escalate into imminent violence, *call 911
immediately* (or your local emergency number outside the US). Do not
wait, call.

If the harassment continues, the Family Law divisions of your county
court will typically be staffed with people who specifically deal with
domestic violence matters. These people can help you file a domestic
violence complaint (if it is warranted) and explain the legal
protections available to you. Check your local government listings to
find the number of your Family Law division of your county court.

If the court is closed, if COVID is preventing the court from
responding, or if the issue may devolve into imminent violence, ***call
911***. Police are also trained with assisting in potential domestic
violence situations.
