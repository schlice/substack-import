We were indeed *made* in God's image. If only we *stayed* that way.

The reason why we have flaws and limitations is detailed in the book of
Genesis in the Bible. The third chapter, to be precise. It's the story
of Adam and Eve, and their fall from grace. The world was created in
chapter 1, and they were created by God in chapter 2.

The Spark Notes version: Adam and Eve were created perfectly. Then sin
entered the world, and Adam and Eve (and all of us as their heirs) were
*changed*.

Adam and Eve were literally in perfect bodies, not knowing pain or
suffering, disease or death. But then, they sinned against God; they
broke His rules. Doesn't matter if the rule was stupid. Doesn't matter
if they should have had the knowledge of good and evil without having to
break God's rules to get it. The fact is that God told them not to do
something, and they did it anyway. They *sinned* against God.

As punishment, God said the following to the woman:

> "I will make your pains in childbearing very severe;\
> with **painful labor** you will give birth to children.\
> Your desire will be for your husband,\
> and he will rule over you." --- Genesis 3:16 NIV

Then God said the following to the man:

> "Because you listened to your wife and ate fruit from the tree about
> which I commanded you, 'You must not eat from it,'
>
> "**Cursed is the ground because of you**;\
> through **painful toil** you will eat food from it\
> all the days of your life.\
> It will produce thorns and thistles for you,\
> and you will eat the plants of the field.\
> By the sweat of your brow\
> you will eat your food\
> **until you return to the ground,**\
> since from it you were taken;\
> for dust you are\
> and to dust you will return." --- Genesis 3:17--19 NIV

You can see in the quoted and bolded sections that pain and suffering
were introduced to humanity, and the world they were cast out into was a
*fallen* world (cursed is the ground because of you). After their sin,
they could no longer live in perfect bodies as God intended. They now
knew pain (Eve knew the pain of childbirth, Adam knew the pain of toil
to scratch food from the earth). And they both now knew death (until you
return to the ground).

So pain, disease and death were not part of our original design. They
were part of our version 2.0 updates.

The next two verses are extremely interesting and we can spend a lot of
time on them, but they are somewhat unrelated to the question:

> The Lord God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed
> them. And the Lord God said, "The man has now become like one of us,
> knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand
> and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever." ---
> Genesis 3:21--22 NIV

Taken together, they foretell the coming of Christ, whose shed blood
covers our sins. I'll get there in a minute. But first, why did God say,
"The man has now become like one of us...\[h\]e must not be allowed to
reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live
forever"? Was God preventing man from becoming all that he could be?
Hardly. What He was doing was *protecting the path to salvation.*

See, God knew that once man had sinned, the only was to salvation was
*shed blood as atonement for sin*. God even demonstrates this in chapter
21: "The Lord GOd made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and
clothed them." ***This is the world's first blood sacrifice. Blood of an
innocent was shed to cover man's sin.*** Think about that for a second.
God demonstrated, in that moment, how man was to be saved. And the
Jewish people practice that blood offering to cover man's sin to this
day.

So that brings us back to the Tree of Life. Why couldn't man live
forever? *Because if Jesus couldn't die on the cross, he couldn't pay
for our sin, and we would live forever in disease-racked bodies, being
permanently separated from God, with no method by which we could be
redeemed.* So God saved us by preventing us from being immortal so that
Christ could die on the cross as a propitiation for our sins.
