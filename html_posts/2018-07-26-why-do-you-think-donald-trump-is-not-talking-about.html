**Why do you think Donald Trump is not talking about the 14th
Amendment?**

It doesn't get as many Twitter likes as blaming Democrats for things.
You can't rail on about the 14th Amendment in ALL CAPS on Twitter and
get 10k new followers out of it, so why bother?

It doesn't rally the base like the 2nd Amendment does.
