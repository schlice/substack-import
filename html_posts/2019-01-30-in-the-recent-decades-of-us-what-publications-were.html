**In the recent decades of US, what publications were listed as illegal
despite the First Amendment?**

The last time the United States listed a book as illegal was in 1963. It
was [[Fanny
Hill](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1f0488&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanny_Hill){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"

qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}, and it was banned due to
its graphic sexual content. School libraries still routinely ban this
book, mostly because of its graphic depictions of sex as well as the
images in the book, which could rightly be categorized as pornography.

As our definitions of the First Amendment have matured, we have stopped
making books *illegal*. Instead, school districts and libraries have
decided to not carry these books because the themes they discuss are
"too controversial" or in more recent days, use "hate speech" which many
have decided is not free speech.

To be clear, in the United States, these bans are wrong. The First
Amendment exists to protect speech like this, speech that some may find
objectionable. In essence, **hate speech** ***is*** **free speech.** We
consider this to be *censorship* and we actively work to educate school
districts and libraries when they attempt to ban literature.

The American Library Association keeps [[a list of banned
books](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e43a60&url=http://www.ala.org/advocacy/bbooks/frequentlychallengedbooks){.external_link
