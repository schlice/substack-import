There are a few issues that Christians should watch out for.

- As long as the married couple is using their own eggs and sperm, there
  are no issues regarding activities outside of the bonds of marriage.
- The other would be related to unused embryos. This should be avoided
  at all costs, as Christians believe that babies are human beings from
  the moment of conception. Destruction of unused fertilized eggs should
  be completely avoided.

Therefore, if IVF is used by a married couple, and if care is taken to
prevent the intentional destruction of fertilized eggs (embryos), then
it is a morally good action that pleases God because it violates no
scriptural guidelines, achieves the moral good of overcoming
infertility, and brings the blessing of children to yet another family.
