Atheism in practice is not meaningless. Atheism in definition is.

Atheists like to try to shut down debate by claiming that **they have no
belief in the existence of god.** But that statement is logically
incongruent.

The truth is that ***everyone believes in the truth of something,***
especially when the something can only be proven by induction, which can
never be 100% true, just degrees of possibility. The truth is that
atheists **believe** **that their lack of belief in a god is true.**
That's a belief.

And if an atheist ever insists that this is all semantics: they don't
believe in the lack of existence of god, they simply have no belief in
god; *ask them* *if they truly believe their disbelief is true.* If they
say yes, you've proven they have a belief. If they say no, then you've
shown them that they don't believe in their disbelief, so the
double-negative means that they believe there could be a god.

But if you meet an intellectually honest atheist who understands that he
believes there is no god, you can work with that. That is a topic which
can be debated. There's meaning in that debate.

But fighting about the definition of atheism is meaningless. Trying to
argue that you have no belief is silly semantics and it intentionally
dodging the question, probably because they have no evidence that there
is no god.
