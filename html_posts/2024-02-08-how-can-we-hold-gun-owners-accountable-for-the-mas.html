The only way you can make "gun ownership" responsible for the criminal
actions of individuals is to first remove the protections afforded by
the Constitution for those who keep and bear arms.

Then you can start making the case that "gun ownership" causes people to
commit mass shootings. While nothing stops you from making that case
today, gun owners can always rest on the fact that the Constitution
protects the right to keep and bear arms.

You'll have to sell to the average American that owning a gun is a
direct cause of other people committing mass shootings. You have to
convince them that the gun they have in the safe, which doesn't kill
anyone, somehow causes someone else in another state to kill people.

Once you can do that, you can start to hold gun owners accountable for
the mass shootings caused by gun ownership.

It certainly won't be easy, because it will mean upending the entire
system of justice in this country, which has always held that the only
person directly responsible for a crime is the criminal. But I bet given
the right conditions, you could do it.

Never give up on your dreams!
