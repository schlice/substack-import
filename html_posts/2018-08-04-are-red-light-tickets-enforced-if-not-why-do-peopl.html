**Are red light tickets enforced? If not, why do people still pay
them?**

I think what you're referring to are tickets from "red light cameras."

In most states, while there is no impact to your *driving record* for a
ticket from a red light camera, if you fail to pay the ticket, there
will probably be a negative impact on your *credit rating* as your
ticket will go to a collections agency.

If you're pulled over and given a ticket by a police officer for running
a red light, you'd better believe that there would be a future effect to
your continued driving privilege. Accumulate enough of those unpaid
tickets, and you might even spend some quality time in the Gray Bar Inn.
