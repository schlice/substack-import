**Johnny with intent to kill Jomar went to the latter\'s house and upon
seeing him on the bed, shot him immediately. Later, Johnny realized that
Jomar was already dead for a couple of hours. What is the crime
committed? Why is it punishable by law?**

Cool, law school questions!

Anyway, you can't murder someone who is already dead. The elements of
the crime of murder are not met, namely the very first one: the unlawful
taking of a life. Even if you fully intended to murder someone, you
cannot commit the crime if they are already dead.

You could absolutely be charged with attempted murder. In attempted
murder, a person must take a direct step towards the killing and must
have the specific intent to kill that person. The crime of attempted
murder has an *action* and an *intention*. The action would be to going
to Jomar's house and entering it. The intention is to kill Jomar. In the
vast majority of US states, Johnny could be charged with attempted
murder.

The *defense* to the attempted murder charge would be one we call
*impossibility*. Johnny doesn't deny going to Jomar's house with the
specific intent of killing him. However, he could not commit the murder
because Jomar was already dead. You can't have an attempted murder if
you can't actually commit the crime of murder. Some states do not allow
the impossibility defense, but if Johnny's state does, he could make
that claim.

He could also be charged with unlawful discharge of a firearm, and
mutilating a corpse.
