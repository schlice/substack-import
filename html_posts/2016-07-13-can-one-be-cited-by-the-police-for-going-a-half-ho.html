Under normal circumstances, you are allowed to drive below the speed
limit. There are some limitations. On some roads (such as highways),
there can be a minimum speed posted; you cannot drive below the minimum
speed posted. Also, you cannot create a traffic hazard; if you are
driving slower than the rest of traffic, please try to stay to the
right. If you are driving so slowly that you create a traffic hazard,
you can also be stopped and/or cited. If you are driving like this, you
should have your hazard lights on and be in the rightmost lane or on the
shoulder.
