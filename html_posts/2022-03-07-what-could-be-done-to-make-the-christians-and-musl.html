We need to end the war on truth.

Our postmodern culture has really twisted the idea of truth. They say
that there is no such thing as absolute truth, and that truth is
relative. They say pithy little sayings like "my truth," usually in a
sentence like, "I'm speaking my truth." These days, these ideas are
hailed as progressive and enlightened.

But the religious among us (Christians and Muslims alike) know that
there *is* absolute truth, and it *can* be known. We know that two
contradictory things cannot both be true at the same time.

Getting along is what we call "tolerance." Tolerance means treating
people who have different ideas with respect and civility. But the
postmodernists in society treat tolerance as affirming that
contradictory ideas are both valid, and this doesn't really make sense.

For example, I can believe that Christianity is the one true religion,
and I can still respect my Muslim brothers and sisters, and treat them
with civility. And it's also important to note that Christianity is not
the only religion which makes truth claims. All major religions make
these types of claims. Most of the central beliefs of these religions
simply cannot be reconciled. For example, Islam teaches that Jesus
Christ was a prophet, not a deity. But if Jesus was only a prophet, he
couldn't have been a very good one, because he claimed to be God. If he
wasn't really God, then he was either a liar or he was insane. Neither
of those make him a very good prophet, or teacher.

**TL;DR:** Regardless of our differences in beliefs, it doesn't mean we
can't be civil. It just means that we have different beliefs. Tolerance
means treating others with respect. It doesn't mean we have to reconcile
all of our beliefs, as most of them are irreconcilable.

What could be done to make the Christians and Muslims get along? How
would they found out the real prophet between the Christ and Muhammed?
