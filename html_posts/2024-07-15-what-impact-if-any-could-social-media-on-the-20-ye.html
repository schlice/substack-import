When you spend your entire political capital telling anyone who will
listen that Trump is the greatest threat to democracy that this country
faces, when you compare him to "literally Hitler," when you tell people
that "if he is elected, that's the last election this country will ever
hold," you shouldn't be surprised when someone actually believes you.
