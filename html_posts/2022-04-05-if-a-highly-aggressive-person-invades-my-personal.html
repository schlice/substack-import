As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."

In general, in "stand your ground" states, there is no duty to retreat
from aggressive people. Obviously, the best choice is to do so, *if you
can*. If the aggressive person is blocking your path, then retreat may
not be an option.

In such a case, you must still believe that there is a threat of
*imminent use of unlawful force* before you can respond with non-lethal
force in order to prevent that assault. This is the part which varies
wildly from state to state. Some states say that an assault must occur
first; others say that the threat of assault is enough.

TL;DR: Check your state laws on assault and your ability to defend
against it before you go popping some aggressive person in the nose and
getting arrested for assault yourself.

Original question:

If a highly aggressive person invades my personal space (arms length)
after I\'ve repeatedly warned them not to am I legally allowed to strike
first?
