At the risk of doing someone's Con Law homework, I'll answer the
question.

The **14th Amendment** was one of the most important amendments to the
Constitution following the Bill of Rights and the 13th Amendment (which
abolished slavery). The 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments were the
"Reconstruction Amendments" passed following the Civil War. The 14th is
sometimes known as the "second Constitution" because of its major role
in future interpretation of the Constitution. This amendment has been
cited more times than any other amendment because of how greatly it
expanded civil rights. It was the first amendment to directly address
the states as well. There are five sections in the 14th Amendment, but
the one with the most influence is Section 1:

> SECTION 1
>
> All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to
> the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the
> State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law
> which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the
> United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life,
> liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any
> person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.

There are three provisions in here which are important:

*The Citizenship Clause* states that if you are born here, you are a
citizen. This has created the issue of [[**anchor

*The Due Process Clause* says that no person may be deprived of life,
liberty, or property without due process of law.

*The Equal Protection Clause* says that the law must be applied equally
to all citizens.

The other provisions in the 14th Amendment include assurances that all
citizens are counted equally when it comes to representation in Congress
and other provisions.

The **15th Amendment,** the last of the Reconstruction Amendments,
provided voting rights to former black slaves. The text reads, "The
right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or
abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color,
or previous condition of servitude."
