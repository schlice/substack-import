**My 15 year old son sends nudes photos of him to random people, how
should I confront him?**

Immediately and decisively.

I didn't set too many rules on cell phone use with my boys

...except one.

No nudes. Either sent or received.

Possession and distribution of child pornography is no joke. It is a
federal crime, especially if the person he is sending them to is in
another state.

If you pay the bill, you make the rules.
