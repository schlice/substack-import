Thanks for the A2A.

For me, the most brutal truth of this disease is that *despite our best
efforts*, *we can't stop it*.

Despite how good you may feel, it continues to wreak havoc on our
nervous system.

Despite the fact that you religiously keep to your DMD regimen, we can't
stop it, we can only slow it down.

Despite all of our knowledge and advancements in medicine, we still
don't know what causes this disease.

That's the brutal truth: **despite everything we know, there is still so
much we don't.**
