**I have \$32,000 past due on HOA now they put liens on me and not
taking my offer. I told them I could only pay \$1,000 monthly. What
should I do?**

Get a lawyer.

Your lawyer and the HOA should be able to work out a payment plan that
is agreeable to both parties.

The HOA should do this on their own, but not everyone can be so easily
convinced to do the right thing every single time.

If worse comes to worse and the HOA will not negotiate, you'll have to
take out a loan for the amount that you owe, and then you'll be able to
pay your loan back over time. Otherwise, the HOA can foreclose on your
lien and sell your house to get the money they are owed.
