First of all, states are indeed independent, but there are no
requirements for a US citizen to become a resident of a new state.
Residency rules are different for every state, and in some states,
simply spending a certain amount of time in the state qualifies you as a
state resident. In most states, you generally need to own property in
that state in order to be considered a state resident. A current utility
bill or some other form of state government issued ID (like a driver's
license) is usually all that's required to establish state residency.
Note you can only have a driver's license from one state, but you can be
a state resident in multiple states. For example, I can live on a state
border town and work in the neighboring state. I have residency in my
primary state because I own property, and I have residency in the
neighboring state because I work 40 hours a week there.

To that end, if someone "resides" in a state for a certain period of
time, or spends a specific amount of time working in that state, they
become state residents under that state's residency rules.

If a state wanted to prevent non state residents from living in their
state, they could do one of several things, including but not limited
to:

- Decrease the amount of time required before an out-of-stater becomes a
  resident, thus removing the problem
- Creating an "out-of-state tax" charged to non state residents, which
  is higher than the regular state resident tax rate
- Taxing businesses who employ people who do not reside in the state

I'm sure there are others, but this is all I could think of.

The problem with such a scenario is it doesn't make sense to discourage
people from coming to your state any way you can get them. When they
work in your state, they generate income tax revenue. When they spend
money at the store in your state, they generate sales tax revenue. And
if they're in your state long enough, they become residents and register
their cars and pay road use tax and property tax and all kinds of other
taxes. So for a state, it's counterproductive to keep people out. States
are doing everything they can to keep people in.
