**How can one keep masked trespassers off their property in the day and
I don\'t mean raccoons?**

Let's start with the easiest one:

[[Amazon.com : Orbit 62100 Yard Enforcer Motion-Activated Sprinkler with
Day & Night Detection Modes : Lawn And Garden Sprinklers : Garden &
Outdoor](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f22507&url=https://www.amazon.com/Orbit-62100-Activated-Sprinkler-Detection/dp/B009F1R0GC){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}

This is a link to a ***motion-activated sprinkler***. This thing is
designed to keep deer and other animals off of your lawn. It has a
motion sensor and a standard lawn sprinkler. When it detects motion, it
kicks on the sprinkler.

Then, if they bypass the sprinkler, when they get closer to the house,
this one will pick them up:

[[Amazon.com: Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam
Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, White: Amazon
Devices](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2525ad&url=https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Floodlight-Camera-Motion-Activated-Security/dp/B0727XJQLD){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}

This one is a little more technological (and a little more expensive),
but it will notify you when it detects motion, the floodlights kick on
and you are notified on your phone. You can initiate 2--way conversation
with them, and activate a 110-decibel siren. Crooks don't like loud
noises or bright lights.

Finally, you can simply pick up your phone and dial 911. Tell the
operator there are masked men on your lawn and you think you saw a gun.
You'll get response as fast as your department can send it.

Now, use defense in depth. Make sure you have a dog (or something that
sounds like a dog - Alexa has a program that sounds exactly like a guard
dog). Make sure you have a panic room you can go to. And finally (if you
are prepared for the responsibility), be armed in your panic room and if
the door opens and it's not a police officer, be prepared to defend your
life and the lives of anyone in the panic room with you.
