**Content:** [Because atheism cannot offer any more proof that there is
no god than I can offer that there is a god.\
\
And considering the gravity of the charge, it would seem that atheism
would need vast evidence, both scientific and empirical, that proved
beyond the shadow of a doubt that God does not exist, a burden which it
cannot meet.\
\
As an example, I use the analogy of the lemonade. If I gave you the
choice between two glasses of lemonade and told you one was more tart
than the other, you probably wouldn\'t need too much evidence before
choosing one. However, if I told you that one was flavored with sugar
and the other was flavored with rat poison, you would probably need vast
amounts of evidence before choosing one.\
\
Similarly, atheism cannot provide evidence in proportion to the charge
it levies, considering that making the wrong choice could have
devastating and eternal consequences. Atheism should have proof positive
that a god does not exist, which it simply cannot provide.\
\
Finally, you cannot \"prove\" a negative truth; it is simply not
possible. In order to prove a positive assertion, you only need to find
one shred of evidence. In order to prove a negative assertion, you must
physically inspect every known area at all times in history to prove it,
which cannot be reliably done.\
\
Therefore, you cannot \"prove\" that god does not exist. No
intellectually honest atheist can say with any level of assurity that
god does not exist.\
\
This alone is reason to consider whether or not a god
exists.]{.rendered_qtext}
