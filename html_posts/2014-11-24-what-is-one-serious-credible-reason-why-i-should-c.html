<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Because atheism cannot offer any more proof that there is<br>no god than I can offer that there is a god.\<br>\<br>And considering the gravity of the charge, it would seem that atheism<br>would need vast evidence, both scientific and empirical, that proved<br>beyond the shadow of a doubt that God does not exist, a burden which it<br>cannot meet.\<br>\<br>As an example, I use the analogy of the lemonade. If I gave you the<br>choice between two glasses of lemonade and told you one was more tart<br>than the other, you probably wouldn\'t need too much evidence before<br>choosing one. However, if I told you that one was flavored with sugar<br>and the other was flavored with rat poison, you would probably need vast<br>amounts of evidence before choosing one.\<br>\<br>Similarly, atheism cannot provide evidence in proportion to the charge<br>it levies, considering that making the wrong choice could have<br>devastating and eternal consequences. Atheism should have proof positive<br>that a god does not exist, which it simply cannot provide.\<br>\<br>Finally, you cannot \"prove\" a negative truth; it is simply not<br>possible. In order to prove a positive assertion, you only need to find<br>one shred of evidence. In order to prove a negative assertion, you must<br>physically inspect every known area at all times in history to prove it,<br>which cannot be reliably done.\<br>\<br>Therefore, you cannot \"prove\" that god does not exist. No<br>intellectually honest atheist can say with any level of assurity that<br>god does not exist.\<br>\<br>This alone is reason to consider whether or not a god<br>exists.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
