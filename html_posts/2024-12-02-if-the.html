Not exactly,
[[Lucifer](https://www.quora.com/profile/Lucifer-the-Anti-Christ)]{.qlink_container}.

Remember, Isaiah 14:14 isn't about you. It's about the king of Babylon.
And yes, as people go, he was indeed very powerful and he was a great
conqueror. He certainly had his sights set pretty high if he wanted to
"rise above the stars of God to become one like the Most High." Usually
in the Bible, the *Most High* refers to Yahweh, but in this case, since
we're talking about the king of Babylon, he actually wanted to sit on
the ancient throne of the Canaanite gods.

> You said in your heart,\
> 'I will ascend to heaven;\
> above the stars of God\
> I will set my throne on high;\
> I will sit on the mount of assembly\
> in the far reaches of the north; \-- Isaiah 14:13 ESV

That means that the *Most High* he was referring to was actually Baal.

And the name "Lucifer" is sometimes equated with Satan in the Bible, but
that is a tenuous connection at best. Ultimately, that wasn't the
purpose of Isaiah's writing anyway. It wasn't to write about you, even
though some people use this passage to imply that it was you who wanted
to sit on God's throne, and Isaiah wasn't saying anything like that at
all. Isaiah was merely prophesying the fall of Babylon, nothing more.
