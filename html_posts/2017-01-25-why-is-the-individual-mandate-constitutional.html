What SCOTUS did was to determine the constitutionality of the "fine"
which is imposed if you don\'t buy health insurance. To do this, they
looked at case law and basically found that the fine is not really a
fine, but a tax, regardless of what the government wants to call it. It
is collected with your taxes, it is collected by the IRS, therefore it
is a tax. I think from now on we call that the "walks like a duck" test.

Understanding that it is a tax and not a fee, fine, or penalty, Congress
has the authority to levy taxes, and Congress can use taxes to influence
behavior, including to get you to not buy something (i.e. "sin taxes"),
so they can also use taxes to get you to buy something.
