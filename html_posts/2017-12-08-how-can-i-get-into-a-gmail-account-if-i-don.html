First, go through the lost password dialogs. Remember the following
helpful information from Google:

> As you complete the steps, use as many of the tips below as you can.
> (You might not see all the questions described here.)
>
> If you already tried to recover your account and got a \"Couldn\'t
> sign you in\" message, you can try again.
>
> **Answer as many questions as possible**
>
> Try not to skip questions. If you\'re unsure of an answer, take your
> best guess rather than moving on to another question.
>
> **Use a familiar device & location**
>
> If possible:
>
> - Use a computer, phone, or tablet where you frequently sign in
> - Use the same browser (like Chrome or Safari) that you usually do
> - Be in a location where you usually sign in, like at home or at work
>
> **Be exact with passwords & answers to security questions**
>
> Details matter, so avoid typos and pay attention to uppercase and
> lowercase letters.
>
> **Passwords**
>
> If you\'re asked for the last password you remember, enter the most
> recent one you recall.
>
> - **If don\'t remember your last password:** Use a previous one that
>   you do remember. The more recent it was, the better.
> - **If you can\'t confidently recall any previous passwords:** Take
>   your best guess.
>
> **Answers to security questions**
>
> If you\'re asked a security question and you:
>
> - **Don\'t remember the answer:** Take your best guess.
> - **Know the answer but didn\'t recover your account on your first
>   try:** Consider a different variation of the answer. For example,
>   try \"NY\" instead of \"New York\" or \"Phil\" instead of
>   \"Philip.\"
>
> **Find out when you created your account**
>
> If you don\'t remember the month and year you created your Google
> Account, here are some ways to find out.
>
> - **Look for a sign-up email.** If you can get your email for the
>   account, search for a welcome message from Google or Gmail. If you
>   can\'t, check for a verification email on another account that you
>   used then.
> - **Ask your contacts.** If you use Gmail, ask friends and family when
>   they first got an email from your account.
> - **Think about related events or purchases.** Try to remember if you
>   created your account when you:Had an important life event, like
>   graduating.Bought a new device. Look for any receipts or contracts
>   that could be helpful.
>
> If you can\'t find out the date, take your best guess.
>
> **Enter an email connected to your account**
>
> If you\'re asked to enter an email address you can check now, enter
> one that you\'ve added to your account. Here are some examples:
>
> - A recovery email address helps you get back in and is where we send
>   you security notifications.
> - An alternate email address is one you can use to sign in.
> - A contact email address is where you get information about most
>   Google services you use.
>
> **Add helpful details**
>
> If you\'re asked why you can\'t access your account, include helpful
> details.
>
> Some examples are:
>
> - You\'re traveling.
> - You get a specific error message.
> - You think your account was compromised because of malware or another
>   reason.
> - You changed your password last week and can\'t remember it.

> If your description matches the information we have, this similarity

If you do get this far, a person will actually intervene and see if the
information you entered is close to the information they have on file.
If it matches sufficiently, they will contact you and will help you get
back into your account.

But if you can't access your account, be honest, go through all the
questions thoroughly, and make sure you don't skip questions if you can.
They will do their best to help you get back into your account.
