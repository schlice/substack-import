**Among Catholic rules of conduct, which are for all people, and which
are only for Catholics? For example, can it be argued that a law against
in vitro fertilization in the USA wouldn\'t violate the \"equal
protection\" clause of the 14th amendment?**

I don't think I understand.

The "law" against in-vitro fertilization is not a law. It's religious
guidance. And it only affects Catholics, and it only affects them
insofar as they voluntarily follow the rules of their religion.

You can choose to leave the Catholic religion at any time you like, and
follow another Christian religion that more closely aligns with your
personal beliefs. Or, you can stay a Catholic and not follow their rules
(at your own Catholic peril, of course). Your choice.

But because you have a choice, it doesn't make your religious "law" a
legal requirement for anyone, including Catholics.
