Not everything in the Bible is *prescriptive.* Sometimes, some things in
the Bible are *descriptive*. God telling Adam and Eve to "be fruitful
and multiply" was a command given to *them,* not to *you*. It was
prescriptive for *them*, but it is descriptive for *you*.

God would like you to have children, but you are under no *command* to
have children. Because if that were true, then sterile men and women
would automatically go to hell. Anyone for any reason who did not have
children would go to hell, and that condition does not describe those
who are destined for eternal torment.
