**TL;DR: If your lease agreement specifies noise rules (most do), you
can be evicted for violating those rules.**

Most leases do specify noise rules. It's an apartment and there are
certain concessions you have to make to live in an apartment. One of
those concessions is walking softly and not disturbing your neighbors.
Your lease agreement should also say this.

I know. I'm currently sitting in my 3rd floor apartment. And sometimes
my cat is noisy, and I have to get up out of bed and sit with him in the
recliner until he falls asleep, so that his meowing won't disturb the
neighbors. And I have to take special care to walk softly so as not to
disturb the neighbors below me (even though their kids don't offer the
same courtesy at 0700 on school days, meh).

Anyway, if you've received enough noise complaints, and the landlord has
followed the rules in the lease about notifying you about your
violations of the lease, they can legally begin eviction proceedings for
violating the terms of your lease.

Just be kind to your neighbors. You share walls and floors and ceilings
in an apartment. A little kindness goes a long way, even if others don't
show it to you.
