There **has to be** something to be said about Jesus, because if there
is nothing special about Jesus, then we have a real problem.

We have a real problem because *Jesus claimed to be God.*

So if Jesus was simply a man, and He was ***not*** God as He claimed,
then He was either a charlatan, a trickster, a liar; or He was insane.

In other words, Jesus can either be a **liar**, a **lunatic**, or
**Lord**. He can only be one of these. So the questions to ask yourself:

- What does the *evidence* from the Bible show you?
- What does your *heart* tell you?
