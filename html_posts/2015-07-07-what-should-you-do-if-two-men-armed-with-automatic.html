**Content:** [Depends on where you live.\
\
If you live in a state with an active and well-tested *Castle Doctrine*,
then by all means, defend yourself and your family by all means
necessary, using all force available to you, up to and including deadly
force.\
\
If you do not live in a strong Castle Doctrine state, I still suggest
you defend yourself and your family by all means necessary, using all
force available to you, up to and including deadly force. After you stop
them, however, you may be facing some tough legal challenges to your own
defense of your own family in your own home. But your family will be
safe.]{.rendered_qtext}
