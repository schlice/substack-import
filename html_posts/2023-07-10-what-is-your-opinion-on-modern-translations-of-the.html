They're all useful, but they're useful for different reasons.

The problem with translations is that not all languages have the same
number of words. For example, the Hebrew language has fewer words than
English, so some words in Hebrew have multiple meanings in English. But
when translating from Koine Greek, we have exactly the opposite problem.
For example, there are at least six words in Greek that we represent
with the word *love* in English. If I translate one of them to *love*,
which one did the original author mean? Without context cues (or
something else added), I won't know. If I'm writing a word-for-word
translation, I would just say "love" and leave it at that. If I were
writing a thought-for-thought or paraphrase translation, I would
translate what the author was intending to say rather than just the word
itself.

Word-for-word translations, therefore, translate each word into the
target language, and present an accurate translation, but because of the
issues we described above, can result in some misunderstandings.

Thought-for-thought translators will read a sentence in the source
language and translate it to the target language. Some words may change,
some words may be added, and some words may be consolidated, but the
translator is going for the idea of the sentence rather than
word-for-word accuracy.

Paraphrase translations will expand on that concept, restating a
paragraph in different words, but attempting to express the main idea of
the paragraph.

All three translations seek to accurately express what the author was
trying to say, but they do it in three different ways. So it really
comes down to what you're looking for, and why.

If you want something that's *readable* so you can read the whole thing
through in one sitting and get a good understanding what the writers
were trying to say, then choosing a **paraphrase** translation is a
better fit. If you want something that is more closely related to the
source material and you want that word-level accuracy, but some of the
sentences may not make complete sense, a **word-for-word** translation
is better for you. If you want something somewhere in the middle, choose
a **thought-for-thought** translation.
