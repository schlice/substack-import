No.

Abraham recognized this wasn't some kind of arbitrary murder command,
with the ability to sacrifice whoever he wanted. He knew that it had to
be Isaac because he was the **firstborn.**

**The offering of the firstborn in the Old Testament symbolized the debt
every man owed to God.** Throughout the Old Testament, God lays claim to
each Israelite's firstborn because it represented their very lives.

- At the Passover, God killed the firstborn of every household that did
  not have the blood of a firstborn lamb on the doorpost.
- In the Hebrew sacrificial system, God required the first-born of the
  cattle or sheep to be sacrificed to Him, as well as the first fruits
  of the grain.
- The firstborn sons, He said in Numbers 8:17, also belonged to Him, and
  could only be redeemed back to the parents by means of a sacrifice:

> For all the firstborn among the people of Israel are mine, both of man
> and of beast --- Numbers 8:17 (cf. Exodus 22:29; Numbers 3:46)

That's why Abraham understood what God was asking of him.
