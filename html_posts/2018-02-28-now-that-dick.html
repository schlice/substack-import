**Now that Dick\'s Sporting Goods has joined Walmart in terminating
sales of Assault-style Rifles, can it be surmised that these companies
are more socially responsible than the US Federal Government?**

Since the federal government is not in the business of being "socially
responsible," and neither is business, it doesn't really matter.

But if you're comparing apples to oranges, the government is far more
socially responsible than business because the government is non-profit.
Since businesses are for-profit, they are *de facto* less socially
responsible because they are money-hungry greedy capitalists.

Which makes their recent moves, shall we say, perplexing. I mean, if you
legally sell guns, why would you *voluntarily* stop selling the nation's
most popular gun? Because you want *more* sales? Sales 101 says that if
you want more sales, you should sell things that people actually want to
buy.

Seems a bit contradictory to me, doesn't it?

So then, why would Walmart and Dick's stop selling things that are
literally the most popular things people want to buy?

It's not because they are trying to make money, that much is clear.
Clearly, they are trying to send a message that they are less concerned
about *profit* and more concerned about *social image.*

This is a practice we call ***virtue signaling***. Virtue signaling is
"the action or practice of publicly expressing opinions or sentiments
intended to demonstrate one\'s good character or the moral correctness
of one\'s position on a particular issue."

So Dick's and Walmart are clearly doing this because they are trying to
show you, the sheeple (or "sheep-like people" who follow trends blindly,
without using your minds), that they have "good character" or "moral
correctness," even if it goes against the very nature of what they do.

Therefore, you might rightly conclude that they are "good people," but
they're terrible business owners. Walmart will do fine because they sell
enough other stuff, but this move will hurt Dick's, as no one in their
right mind will ever buy a gun from them ever again. I think both of
them should get out of the gun selling game altogether. That would be a
great virtue signal, wouldn't it?

Dick's and Walmart, take my advice: leave gun sales to the
professionals.
