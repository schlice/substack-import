**How do you think Trump will try to get out of this Manafort and Cohen
situation?**

There's nothing to "get out of."

At worst, if you squint hard and look sideways at it, Trump may have
violated campaign finance laws by paying off Stormy Daniels to keep her
quiet. However, that's unlikely because there are substantial
non-political reasons why he would have wanted to pay off Stormy
Daniels, which makes the payments permissible.

Nevertheless, the worst possible outcome for Trump is that his campaign
is found to have violated campaign finance laws, and he pays a fine.

Just like Obama's campaign. They paid a fine. Life went on.

I hate to bring up the elephant in the room, but someone has to:
*literally none of this has anything whatsoever to do with Russian
collusion in the 2016 election.* Sure, a couple of guys may have broken
Federal law. Manafort didn't pay his taxes correctly. Cohen also had tax
issues. Cohen paid hush money to a porn star.

But none of this has anything to do with Russia, or collusion, or using
Russia to rig an election. None of it.

So again, there's nothing to "get out of." This situation will resolve
itself. Two guys go to jail for their own crimes. Life goes on.
