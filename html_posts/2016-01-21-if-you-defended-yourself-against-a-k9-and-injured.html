In almost every jurisdiction that I am aware, police K9s are considered
sworn peace officers, despite the fact that they could not raise their
right hand or salute when their badge was pinned on.

If you injure a police K9, you would be charged with aggravated assault
against a peace officer, and if you killed the K9, you would also be
charged with destruction of government property (while states may
consider them peace officers, they are still property, not people).
