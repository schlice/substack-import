**What\'s the next step if Congress issues a subpoenas to get Muller
report and DOJ does not comply?**

The House Judiciary Committee (not the full Congress) has already issued
subpoenas to get the full, unredacted report from the Special Counsel.
The DOJ will not comply, because they legally are unable to do so.

If the House Judiciary Committee wishes to press forward, they will have
to file a lawsuit to attempt to force the matter in court. They will,
similarly, lose there as well.

They can also hold the Attorney General in contempt of Congress. This
too will have no effect. How do I know this? [[It's happened
before.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1ad2c4&url=https://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2014/10/judge-declines-to-hold-holder-in-contempt-196650){.external_link

in that case, no judge in his or her right mind would hold an AG in
contempt of Congress for following the law.

By the way, they fully know this. This is nothing more than a publicity
stunt that their 2020 hopefuls can run on.
