**Content:** [There are a small handful of states that provide some
\"duty to report\" in certain situations, and there are some professions
which have professional (and in some cases, legal) obligations to report
unlawful activity, but for the vast majority of states, for the vast
majority of citizens, there is no legal requirement that you report
anything to the police.\
\
If you take positive steps to conceal a crime, or aid or abet a known
criminal, or do something to further the crime, these in and of
themselves are crimes.\
\
However, simply having knowledge that something unlawful is occurring
and not acting on that knowledge is not a crime.\
\
We would hope, however, that the moral code of the individual would
dictate to them that they take some positive step to mitigate the crime,
or its effect (such as contacting the police).]{.rendered_qtext}
