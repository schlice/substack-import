Because the First Amendment has nothing to do with offending anyone.

We have expanded the definition of the First Amendment beyond its
original scope. Recall that the Bill of Rights was designed to enjoin
the government from restricting or infringing on specific rights that
the framers felt deserved enumeration. The First Amendment was designed
to prevent the government from infringing on the people's right to speak
out against their actions. If you did that in England before the US was
founded, the King would have you arrested and probably beheaded. The
framers wanted to make it clear that government was by the people and
for the people, and they should not be free from criticism.

We have expanded the Bill of Rights to mean rights which are individual,
that no *person* should be allowed to violate, not just the
*government.* This is where some of our confusion stems from. The Bill
of Rights was not written to protect your feelings about certain speech,
or to address what one person says to another person. It was only
written to prevent the government from suppressing your ability to speak
out against them.
