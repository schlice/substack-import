When the authentication question comes up, if you don't have access to
the phone registered on the account any more, click the "Need another
way to authenticate?" button down at the bottom.

It will present you with a variety of options. Some options include
authenticating from a device on which you are already logged into
Facebook (if you have one).

If none of the options listed will work, click the "Other options" link
at the bottom. You will be asked to either provide a government-issued
ID, or take a picture of yourself holding a sign with a hand-written
code on it. Once you provide one of these, Facebook will review your
submission and you will be allowed access to your account again.

Be sure to update your phone number so that you can receive login codes
again.

(EDIT) Sorry, I had to disable comments on this answer. Too many people
advertising scams about people getting paid to recover accounts, things
which can be done by you, for free. Don't fall for the hype. Do it
yourself and save!
