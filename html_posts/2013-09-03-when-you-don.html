**Content:** [Let me give you the military equivalent and let you draw
your own conclusions. In the Air Force, we are all collectively called
\"Airmen\" in the same way you would refer to the Army as \"Soldiers\"
and the Navy as \"Sailors.\" We of course had a rank structure which is
far more in depth than that of the police department, but that\'s simply
because of the diversity of positions that require various ranks to show
proficiency and experience.\
\
Anyway, we have a rank called \"Airman\" and it is a low-level enlisted
rank (E-2). I was a Captain (O-3), but I never took offense when someone
called us \"Airmen.\"]{.rendered_qtext}
