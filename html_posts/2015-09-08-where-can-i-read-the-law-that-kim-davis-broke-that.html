**Content:** [She violated the law which states what her job duties are,
and that her job duties require her to certify marriage licenses.\
\
She refused to issue a marriage license to a same-sex couple because it
\"violated her conscience.\" When the petitioners asked the court to
intervene, she was then ordered by a judge to issue the license, and she
refused. She was then remanded into custody for contempt of court for
failing to comply with the judge\'s order to issue the license.\
\
She was released from jail today after the judge was satisfied that any
outstanding licenses were issued by her deputies. However, the judge
barred her from denying marriage licenses in the future. She still
claims she will not issue licenses to homosexual couples that bear her
name. Her attorney says that it is within the power of the court to have
her name removed from the license.\
\
Personally, I think that if someone is not going to do their job, they
should be removed from office. And since she is an elected official, a
recall election would be the next logical step.]{.rendered_qtext}
