We tried it once before. It didn\'t work out as well as we hoped.

After WWI, the US took on a very isolationist foreign policy, because we
really didn\'t want to get involved with any issues in Europe. We
essentially closed down all immigration. We imposed steep tariffs on
imported goods, essentially blocking foreign goods out of the US. We
refused to join the League of Nations so as to avoid unpleasant and
unnecessary entanglements with European nations.

That isolationist policy was one of the factors that contributed to the
rise of Hitler and WWII. How?

European countries had accumulated massive debt to the United States
during the war. They had difficulty repaying those roughly \$10 billion
in loans (even though the US lowered interest rates for them) because of
our aforementioned high tariffs. The Europeans looked to Germany to
repay their war debt, which at the time topped \$33 billion. Germany was
going through its own financial crisis and became completely unable to
repay anyone. Europeans became bitter over these war debts as they
claimed they did most of the fighting and suffered the most, so the US
should cancel their war debts. The US said that more than a third of the
loans were made after the end of the war, so there was no basis to
cancel the debts. With Europe, Germany, and the US locked in this
triumvirate of debt, an overall bitterness set in all across Europe,
especially in Germany (which owed the most), which (yep, you guessed it)
contributed to the rise of Hitler in the 30\'s.

Good intentions, bad consequences. Isolationism is, therefore, bad.
