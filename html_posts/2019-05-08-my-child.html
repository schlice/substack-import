**My childs schools is part of a housing development and the developers
have placed restrictions on the parking. The parking attendants are a
private company who sneak up on you at school times and dont ask you to
move. Is this against the law?**

To answer your specific question, yes this is legal.

But what can you do about it?

Start by putting pressure on the school. Use parent groups like PTA or
school accountability committees (if your school has them). If not, make
an appointment with the principal and express your concerns over the
parking situation. Make them sit down with the developers to come up
with some alternatives for parking around the school. Start a drive
among parents at the school. Walk around during peak times and talk to
parents in their cars to drum up support.

If that doesn't work, go over their heads. Go to the school board for
the district, go to the state department of education.

If that doesn't work, go to your local legislators. Go to your mayor's
office, your city council, or whichever is the closest form of local
government you can reach, and then go up that chain.

Good luck!
