**Content:** [Personally, I believe it\'s because there is far less
\"seat of your pants\" flying than many pilots are getting these days.
It seems there is more simulator time than there is actual flying, and
fewer and fewer pilots recognize the benefits of flying light and/or
motor-less aircraft (i.e. gliders). Learning how to really control an
aircraft should be done, first, without an engine.]{.rendered_qtext}
