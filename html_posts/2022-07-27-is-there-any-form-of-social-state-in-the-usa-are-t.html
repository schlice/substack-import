Yes, we have a "welfare state" in the US. This is a system whereby the
government provides basic care for those who cannot work. It's called
**Medicaid**. We can debate all day how well it works, but the fact is
that we've chosen in this country to use tax dollars to fund the basic
healthcare of those who cannot support themselves.

Your question is flawed. There is no "right to free health care" in the
United States. In the US, we have "*free access* to healthcare," but we
do not have "*access* to *free* healthcare." There is a big difference.

Healthcare is not free. Doctors go to school for years (on their own
dime) to learn their craft so they can be licensed to practice medicine.
They provide a service, for a fee. They are not public servants. They
are practitioners selling a service. It just depends on where the money
comes from to pay them: a universal tax paid by everyone, or by
individuals and employers, along with health insurance companies.

Therefore, healthcare is neither a *right* nor a *privilege*. It is a
**financial transaction.** You pay for a service, plain and simple.
Perhaps there are better ways to pay for that service. Perhaps we should
re-make health insurance and make it, you know, *actual insurance*,
instead of *prepaid medical care*. Actual insurance would work just like
your car insurance does. Your car insurance doesn't pay for gas, or
wiper blades, or tires, or brakes, but it pays for accident repair and
repairs over a specific dollar amount. If car insurance worked like
health insurance currently works in the US, you'd pay a copay at the gas
station and get the gas you needed, and the gas station would bill your
insurance company a pre-negotiated rate for your gas.
