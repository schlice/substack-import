As with all legal answers, this one too is "it depends."

The crime you are talking about is called **conspiracy** **to commit a
crime.** Conspiracy happens when two or more people **agree** to commit
a crime, and then at least one person makes an **overt act** in
furtherance of that crime.

- **Agreement.** The core of conspiracy is a mutual understanding or
  plan between two or more people to commit a crime. This agreement can
  be express or implied. Conspirators must intend to agree to the
  criminal plan and intend for the underlying crime to be committed.
  **The act of conspiring itself is the crime**, and it can be
  prosecuted even if the underlying crime is not actually completed. It
  can be prosecuted even if one person backs out (but that back-out can
  be cited as a mitigating circumstance at sentencing).
- **Overt act.** Most jurisdictions require that *at least one* of the
  conspirators take a concrete step (called an *overt act*) to advance
  the agreed-upon criminal plan. This can be a physical act, a
  communication, or any action that shows progress towards the crime.

So the answer to the question is **yes**, the person who backed out is
guilty of **one** crime: conspiracy to commit a crime, even if they back
out before the first person actually goes ahead with committing the
crime. The person who committed the crime is guilty of **two** crimes:
the actual crime, and conspiracy to commit that crime.
