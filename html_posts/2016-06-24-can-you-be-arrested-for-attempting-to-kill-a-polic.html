Let's dissect your question

***Can you be arrested for attempting to kill a police officer***

Absolutely. I would even go so far as to say *I guarantee you will be
arrested*. You will also be charged with attempted murder (or actual
murder if the officer dies.

***Even though it was self defense and they were in the wrong?***

The notion of "self-defense" is what we call a *defense* against the
charge of murder or attempted murder. The prosecution's job will be to
prove that you were attempting the unlawful taking of a human life, with
forethought and malice. The defense's job will be to show that you were
acting in self-defense.

However, you can't defend yourself using force against a peace officer
acting within his jurisdiction. So it will *also* be the defense
attorney's job to show that the officer was acting ***outside of his
authority***. So you have a very steep hill to climb. Not only do you
first have to show that the officer was acting outside of his authority,
you will then have to show that you were acting in self-defense against
an officer who you unequivocally knew had no authority to do what he was
doing. The prosecutor will literally have a field day with you over that
one. It would be a very difficult charge to prove, since they will most
likely use the "reasonable man" standard, and the reasonable man would
most likely not know that the officer was within or not within his
authority, and that item is a matter of law to be determined by a judge,
not by you.

So will you be arrested? **Yes**. Can you claim self-defense? **You can
claim anything you want, but it will be** ***very*** **difficult to be
found not guilty.**
