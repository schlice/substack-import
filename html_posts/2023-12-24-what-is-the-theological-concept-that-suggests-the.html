The logic behind an inerrant Bible is not independent of the deity of
Christ, as it is Christ who proclaims the inerrancy of the Bible.

Basically, the logic goes like this:

1.  Jesus claimed to be God, which is why He was crucified in the first
    place (blasphemy).
2.  Jesus' claim to be God was miraculously confirmed by:
    1.  His fulfillment of many prophecies about Himself;
    2.  His sinless life and miraculous deeds;
    3.  His prediction and accomplishment of His resurrection.
3.  Therefore, Jesus is God.
4.  Whatever Jesus (who is God) teaches is true.
5.  Jesus taught that the Bible is the inerrant Word of God.
6.  Therefore, it is true that the Bible is the inerrant Word of God.

Do we have any proof that point 5 is true (Jesus taught that the Bible
is inerrant)? When the Sadducees tried to trap Jesus with a question, He
said to them, "You are in error because you do not know the Scriptures
or the power of God" (Matt. 22:29). The implication, of course, is that
the Bible is inerrant. It wouldn't make any sense for Jesus to say, "You
are in error because you don't know the Scriptures, which are also
erroneous!" Therefore, Jesus taught that the Bible is inerrant. And if
Jesus is God, and He said that the Bible is inerrant, then we know that
it is.
