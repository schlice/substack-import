Think about this. We have known, medically, about MS for thousands of
years. We haven\'t had effective treatments for it for most of that
time. It\'s only been in the last 40 years or so that we have been able
to slow the disease progression and lessen its effects. We\'ve gone from
effectively "no treatment" to being able to make the lifespan of someone
with MS basically match the lifespan of someone without MS, and we have
lessened the impact of the disease as well as making the disease less
active in the body.

It has been the development of the MRI and other advanced diagnostic
tools that has propelled the treatment of the disease. As diagnostic
tools improve, and the technology to understand the disease improves,
the race to the cure will be exponential, not linear. I think we will
see a functional cure in my lifetime.
