Yes.

According to Christian theology, Jesus' physical body was perfected and
resurrected. Essentially, he received the OG version 1.0 body that God
initially created for Adam and Eve, the body that was untainted by sin.

The Bible also describes Jesus' *ascension* into Heaven; His physical
body ascended into Heaven, where He lives today.

> blessed them. While he blessed them, he parted from them and was
> carried up into heaven. And they worshiped him and returned to
> Jerusalem with great joy, and were continually in the temple blessing
> God. \-- Luke 24:50-53 ESV*
