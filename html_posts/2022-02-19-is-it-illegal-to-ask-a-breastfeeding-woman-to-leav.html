It is not illegal to ask a breastfeeding woman to leave a public space.

It is similarly not illegal for a breastfeeding woman to tell the person
asking her to kindly f\*\*\* off.

There is no law (as far as I\'m aware, laws can vary by state) which
states that breastfeeding in a public space is illegal. Therefore, there
is no requirement for breastfeeding women to vacate public spaces.

It\'s not illegal to ask. But it\'s also not illegal to not comply.
