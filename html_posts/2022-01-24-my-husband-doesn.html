I'd love to hear about a criminal case against Trump. I'd be curious
which state's attorney was ballsy enough to bring such a case. I suspect
that maybe New York might do it (they're pretty out-there), but I'd want
to know so I could prep the popcorn...

But ultimately, you need to do something illegal first, and then you can
have charges brought against you.

And it can't just be some Democrat's *opinion* of what you did, it has
to be an actual law that you apparently broke. And there has to be
actual proof that points to you as the law-breaker.

Original question:

My husband doesn\'t want to hear about any criminal or civil cases
involving Donald Trump or any of his family, because he says there will
ultimately be no consequences. Do you agree w/ this assessment? Why or
why not?
