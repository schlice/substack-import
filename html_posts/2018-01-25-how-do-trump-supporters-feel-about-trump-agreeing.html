So long as this "path to citizenship" is only for DREAMers, I'm okay
with it. DREAMers are the DREAM Act children, children of undocumented
immigrants who were brought to this country illegally by their parents.

DREAMers didn't violate the law on their own. Their parents did. So
offering them an opportunity to become citizens is something I would
find acceptable.

I would oppose a path to citizenship for their parents. I would oppose a
path to citizenship for any other category of illegal alien.
