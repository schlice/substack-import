It's the same reason why people are claiming that the Justices "lied" in
their confirmation hearings.

**People truly believed that** ***Roe v. Wade*** **was "settled law" and
could never be overturned.**

Indeed, they believed that when the justices talked about "precedent"
and *stare decisis*, this was an indication that if a case ever came
before the Court questioning the very foundation of *Roe*, the Justices
would vote to pass on the case, because somehow *stare decisis* makes
the case untouchable.

The logic doesn't pass muster. And you only need to look at *Plessey v.
Ferguson* to understand why. *Plessey* was the case in the late 19th
century which decided that racial segregation was Constitutional. It was
the "separate but equal" decision. So long as the facilities offered
were equal, racial segregation was Constitutional. That decision was
"precedent" and was treated as *stare decisis* for over 60 years before
the Court, in *Brown v. Board* determined that racial segregation in
schools was, in fact, unconstitutional. That was the beginning of the
end for the *Plessey* finding, and over the next few years, more
decisions were made which functionally overturned the decision.

But why did they keep it so long? People may have understood that the
decision was not Constitutionally accurate, and that *Plessey* actually
did violate the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment, but
ultimately, it came down to the fact that **people liked the outcome,
and so the decision wasn't reviewed.**

This case is absolutely no different. The Justices are looking to fix an
error in a Constitutional decision. Legal scholars have long agreed that
the *foundation* of the *Roe* decision was flawed, Constitutionally
speaking. But, exactly as in the case of *Plessey*, people liked the
outcome, and so the decision wasn't reviewed. However, the draft opinion
in *Dobbs* says that the basis on which they wrote the *Roe* decision,
as well as the decision on *Planned Parenthood v. Casey*, was without
merit (the right to privacy in the Constitution). Therefore, because
there is no right to privacy in the Constitution, there is no right to
an abortion in the Constitution, either.

\

Now that all of this is established, why do people believe that
interracial marriage and same-sex marriage are next?

Well, their limited logic goes, if a *sacrosanct ruling* like *Roe* can
be overturned, can't the other decisions as well?

The short answer is yes, they can. However, it is *extremely unlikely*
that they ever would.

But why not? What makes those cases different from this one?

The first reason is because **the basis upon which those cases were
decided is Constitutionally sound.** Both of those cases found that the
right is protected under the Equal Protection clause of the 14th
Amendment. Knowing this, it would be exceedingly challenging to claim
that somehow, the right to interracial marriage or the right to same-sex
marriage are somehow unconstitutional.

The other reason is that there is difference between interracial
marriage/same-sex marriage and abortion, and it is the idea of
***victimless rights***. Professor Alan Dershowitz coined this term a
few weeks ago.

In the case of interracial marriage or same-sex marriage, does the
exercise of the right impact the exercise of anyone else's rights? The
answer is no. Therefore, these are ***victimless rights.*** In contrast,
does the exercise of the right to abortion impact the exercise of anyone
else's rights? The answer is *potentially*, because at least
potentially, the exercise of the right to an abortion impacts the right
of the fetus to life. The *Roe* court *passed* on the opportunity to
declare whether or not the fetus has such a right, because, at the time,
the medical and philosophical communities could not answer the question
as to whether or not the fetus is alive, and thus possessing the right
to life, and thus to not have that life taken without due process. It
appears that this Court is at least willing to state that the fetus
*may* have a right to life, and therefore the Court should proceed
assuming that it *does*. If that is the case, therefore, the right to an
abortion is **not** a victimless right, and the right to have an
abortion must be weighed against the right of the fetus to life.

\

TL;DR: People fail to realize that the basis upon which interracial
marriage/same-sex marriage are based is Constitutionally sound, unlike
the basis upon which *Roe* was built.

Original question:

Why do people think that if the Supreme Court overturns abortion that
they would go after same sex marriage next, despite the lack of any
substantial movement to do so in the last seven years?
