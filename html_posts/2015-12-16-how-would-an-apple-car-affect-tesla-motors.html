I don\'t think so. The iCar would only be able to be charged from
Apple\'s proprietary charging station, and while there are many of them
around (people install them out in front of their houses just to look
cool), you only get 30 minutes of charge for free each day. You have to
buy a \"power subscription\" to be able to use more power than that from
the charger, so it will only have limited usefulness.

The iCar will work well, and will work consistently, but it will only
appeal to a certain market. Car enthusiasts will not like it because it
won\'t be able to drive faster than 80, even though its electric motors
are capable of about 120. And you won\'t be able to service the vehicle;
the hood will be factory sealed and you can only get it serviced at an
authorized iCar repair facility or you void your warranty.

You won\'t be able to customize the interior of your car very much. Want
to install a Kenwood or Pioneer head unit? Not allowed. Want to put
colored floormats in it? The iCar will not allow them in the door. And
the car will only come in three colors, only one of which people will
actually want to drive.

But everyone will have them, and they will all unequivocally state that
Apple revolutionized the automotive industry.

Yeah, I don\'t think [[Elon

quaking in his boots over an Apple car.
