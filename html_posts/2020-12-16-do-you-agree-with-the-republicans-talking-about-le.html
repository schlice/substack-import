**Do you agree with the Republicans talking about leaving the Republican
party (and possibly starting a new one) because Mitch McConnell called
Biden president elect?**

I am a conservative and I *fully support* any member of Congress who
wishes to leave the Republican party to go and do so and to go start
their own party, simply because someone used a term of description they
don't like. That tends to say more about *them* than it does about *us.*

If that's the hill they want to die on (and subsequently destroy the
remainder of the original GOP), by all means, go ahead.

The New Republican Party will be dedicated to originalist, conservative
values only. Anyone else can stay away. Let's no longer dilute the New
Republican party with RINOs. That's right, the likes of Olympia Snowe,
Mitt Romney, and Susan Collins will not be welcome.
