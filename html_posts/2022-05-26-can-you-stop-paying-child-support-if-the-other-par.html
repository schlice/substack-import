Yes!

There is a process, however. You can't just, on your own, stop paying
child support.

The process goes like this:

- Contact your lawyer
- Petition the court to award you sole physical custody, using the fact
  that the other parent is not taking care of the child as your
  reasoning. The clearest reason to seek sole custody is to protect your
  child from physical harm. The other parent can still have supervised
  visits with the child, but you become the one who makes all the
  decisions for the child.

Then you don't have to pay anyone child support! You have the money, you
support the child!
