**You can bet there are people in high places taking a hard look at
Trump\'s latest string of pardons. if evidence of a quid pro quo is
found involving either pardons for silence or for cash, is there any
recourse the Justice Department can take?**

Clearly, you know nothing about how pardons work, and you know less
about which president has issued questionable pardons in their 11th
hour.

First of all, before a pardon request ever makes it to the President, it
goes through the [[Office of the Pardon
Attorney](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=174aac&url=https://www.justice.gov/pardon){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="justice.gov"}]{.qlink_container}. Before that happens, a
person convicted must actually serve at least five years (less only in
the highest profile cases) before they can submit a request for pardon.
The Pardon Attorney will request counsel from the Attorney General, and
then and only then will the request be sent to the president. There are
a lot of factors considered before a request for pardon is even
considered.

Second, Trump has pardoned 28 and commuted 16 people's sentences. Obama
pardoned 212 (two-thirds of those during his last year in office, after
the elections were over) and commuted 1,715 sentences (mostly after the
election).

But if, as you claim, Trump accepted a bribe to pardon someone, it is at
least conceivable that he can be charged under 18 USC ยง201, after he
leaves office. But it is highly unlikely for a number of practical
reasons.
