Yes, absolutely. Not only does the public believe this, but the police
do, too.

If the police are required to wear body cameras and to film every
interaction they have with the public, the public rightly should have
the same freedom to do so.

The line is, as you mentioned, drawn when the recorder gets too close to
a police activity in the name of "freedom to film". You can't interfere
with police activities, and if a cop tells you to move back, move back.

Now, if a cop tells you to stop recording, you do it but take your
recording to a lawyer, or your nearest ACLU branch.
