Yes, of course they will! Because they've shown in the past just how
objective and clear-thinking they are...

/s

They will absolutely downplay the documents (EDIT: [[they
did](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=59c8e5&url=https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/10/politics/classified-documents-joe-biden/index.html){.external_link

Biden had classified documents in his private office at the University
of Pennsylvania is ***entirely different from why Trump had classified
documents at Mar-a-Lago.***

Normally, when a President (or Vice President) leaves office, a third
party contractor packs up all of their documents and delivers them to
the person's personal residence. The documents are then hand-sorted by
the person's representative and a representative from the National
Archives, and they collectively determine, for each document, whether it
goes to the person's private collection (or into their Presidential
Library), or is relinquished to the government to be filed at the
National Archives. While this isn't how it's supposed to happen under
the rules in the Presidential Records Act, this is how it has actually
happened for every single president since the law was passed, and the
system seems to work acceptably.

That document haul has routinely included classified documents, which
are simply reverted back to the government. This is how Trump ended up
with classified documents in his possession.

But the possession of documents in Biden's personal office at the
University of Pennsylvania is, as of yet, unexplained. Biden used that
office while he was an honorary professor at the University from 2017 to
2019.

Of course, as was already mentioned, the White House is downplaying
these documents, classifying them as "fewer than a dozen files," none of
which are "particularly sensitive" and "not of high interest to the
intelligence community." However, this is different in a number of very
key ways:

- This is "fewer than a dozen files" which means it's unlikely to be a
  bunch of useless documents just shuffled someplace in a massive
  document dump. They're more likely to be specifically taken to that
  location by the principal (in this case, Biden). So he can't claim
  innocence; he can't claim he didn't know they were there (even though
  he already has). The small number of files indicates that they were
  likely deliberately brought there.
- These files were **TS/SCI** (Top Secret, Sensitive Compartmentalized
  Information) sensitivity, the release of which could cause
  "***exceptionally grave damage to the United States or her allies***."
  Files which are "not particularly sensitive" are never labeled as
  TS/SCI.
- And I really don't care what the intelligence community finds
  interesting, because whether or not something is interesting to some
  rando intelligence analysts does not determine its classification
  level.

Sorry White House, I'm not buying your downplay. Why were those
documents unsecured in that office? At least documents in Mar-a-Lago are
in an area protected by Secret Service and only accessible by authorized
and cleared people. But an office at UPenn? Not highly secured.

This is a bigger story than anyone is talking about, and in true
government/media collaboration, this story will be summarily buried.
