It's probably not illegal because of a flawed interpretation of the
first amendment.

Remember that the Bill of Rights was originally meant to protect you
against **government action**. For example, the government cannot throw
you in jail for protesting against them.

However, over time, and through case law, the first amendment has been
interpreted to mean that ***anyone*** is free to say ***anything***
**to** ***anyone*** at ***any time***.

Whether or not this is a good thing depends on the particular speech.
Clearly, protesting at a funeral is in bad taste. It is a time of
mourning, and whether or not you agree with the person who died, letting
the family grieve is right and proper. So not a good thing, but under
current interpretations of the Constitution, it is legal.

Trying to make it illegal would be constitutionally problematic.
