**What can I say as a struggling single mother to convince my landlord
not to evict me after 4 months of inability to pay?**

You asked this question on February 19th, 2021 (and I'm answering it the
same day). We've already been hit hard for nearly a year by an economic
shutdown precipitated by the government's response to COVID-19.

So what do you tell him? Read the news.

You have at least one more month before you can be evicted if you lost
your job because of COVID-19.

I would suggest using that month to find a new place to live if you
cannot pay for your current place. This is a gift; you do not want an
eviction on your credit report as a single mother.

Find a place to go. If you have no friends or family who can take you
in, contact a local church in your area. Any one. You don't even have to
be a member (but if I may be so bold, find a Christian church near you).
If you don't want to go the church route, you can always try local
government assistance agencies, womens' shelters, or even the Red Cross.
They can all help you find at least a temporary place for you and your
child.

But whatever you do, move out before you are evicted.

You must understand that under most conditions, landlords do not own
*outright* the buildings they are leasing. They've taken out mortgages,
or they work for another company which owns the property, which also
leveraged funds to purchase the property. *THAT* money is going to come
due at some point. You literally cannot kick the can down the road
forever. Sooner or later, even these chickens will come home to roost,
and someone will have to pay. You can bet your bottom dollar that it
will eventually be you.

So do yourself a favor and if you cannot find work, spend your time
trying to find some kind of temporary housing for yourself and your
child, and then go.
