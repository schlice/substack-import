**Content:** [Statutes of limitations exist to protect the defendant.
They exist for a number of reasons, but primarily the idea is to make
sure that defendants are prosecuted using evidence that has not
deteriorated with time. Physical evidence as well as peoples\' memories
can deteriorate with time. Some common law philosophy behind them
include the fact that plaintiffs who have cause to bring charges should
do so within a reasonable amount of time, and the longer the gap between
the commission of the crime and its prosecution constitutes an unjust
burden on the defendant. Also, as more time passes, you have less
possibility of providing a fair outcome for a defendant as evidence and
memory may have deteriorated.]{.rendered_qtext}
