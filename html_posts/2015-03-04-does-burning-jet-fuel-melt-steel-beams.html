**Content:** [No, jet fuel does not burn hot enough to melt steel beams.
Jet fuel burns between 800° and 1500°F which is not hot enough to melt
steel, which melts at 2750°F.\
\
But (and I presume this is a 9/11-related question), jet fuel and the
subsequent fires they caused inside the building *did* cause the steel
to lose its structural integrity and buckle. None of the steel in the
building was *melted*, but it was twisted and warped from losing
structural integrity. Steel can lose around 50% of its structural
integrity at around 1100°F. Studies of the wreckage showed that some of
the pockets of fire reached over 1800°F, more than enough to cause the
steel to lose its structural integrity and allow the floors to
collapse.\
\
You would think that structural engineers would have thought of this,
and would have taken steps to prevent the beams from becoming heated in
a fire, you know, like using *insulation* and stuff.\
\
In fact, at one time, the beams in the building were insulated. With
*spray-on asbestos*. As you know, exposure to airborne asbestos
particles causes a very specific lung cancer called *mesothelioma*. So
asbestos has been banned in construction for the last 25 years. Anywhere
that asbestos was found to have been used in fireproofing in
construction, it has been removed. Removal is a difficult and costly
process, since you have to control the airborne asbestos particles very
carefully.\
\
In the WTC, the asbestos was removed from the beams, but *had not yet
been replaced*. As long as the sprinkler systems in the building are
working, and the insulation is scheduled to be replaced, this is
acceptable under NYC fire code. This lack of insulation on the beams
allowed them to heat above 1200°F and lose structural integrity, causing
the upper floors to collapse, and the floors underneath to
pancake.]{.rendered_qtext}
