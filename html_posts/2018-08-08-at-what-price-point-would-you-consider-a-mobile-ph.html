**At what price point would you consider a mobile phone case
ridiculously overpriced? What is the line you won\'t go beyond?**

It really depends what I'm protecting, what its warranty is, what
coverage I have for damage, and how much I need to protect it against
damage.

For example, my current daily driver is a Galaxy S8. Now, we all know
that the S8 is a screen crack magnet. Even though it's rocking Gorilla
Glass 5, it still tends to crack more than average, and industry drop
tests confirm this. However, it's a company phone, and they will replace
it if the screen cracks. They don't pay for my case, however.

So I get the case that I know has excellent corner protection, but isn't
going to break the bank. I have a [[Spigen Tough Armor
Case](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=73a52b&url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XP74MYV/ref%3Doh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie%3DUTF8%26psc%3D1){.external_link

qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}. It's one of the best-rated
cases at this price point, and so far, it has performed admirably
protecting my phone. I have dropped my phone once from waist high onto
the street and it was totally fine. I've also reviewed the OtterBox
Commuter for this phone, and it didn't review quite as well as previous
OtterBox designs, so I didn't feel comfortable shelling out the
additional for an OtterBox with it reviewing so poorly. I highly
recommend Spigen's cases, and if you haven't checked them out yet, you
should give them a chance.

Now for my wife's phone, I had to get an OtterBox, no question. She is
admittedly clumsy with her phone, often sticking it in workout pants or
shorts with no pockets and watching it tumble to the floor. Granted,
she's not tall so it's not a far drop, but she drops her phone far more
frequently than I do. So she most definitely has an OtterBox Commuter on
her iPhone 8. Pink and grippy, of course. So yes, I will shell out \$40
on that case.

If the situation called for it, I would definitely spend \$50 on an
OtterBox Defender (if I know I'm going to be working all day outside and
I could potentially be dropping my phone all over the place). But that's
it. Anything above \$50 is overkill.

Unless it's a specialty case like a battery case, which I know is going
to be more. However, I don't even get the expensive battery case. I got
the [[Elebase Battery
Case](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cb8cc4&url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071923NPC/ref%3Doh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie%3DUTF8%26psc%3D1){.external_link

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container} for my phone, and it works
great. I had some issues with the PowerBear battery case for my son's
S7+, but I've had nothing but good things to say about this case. It's
totally worth the \$23 I spent on it. I don't keep it on unless I know
I'm going to be away from power for a full day or two.

I used to use ZAGG InvisibleShields on all my gear screens exclusively,
but when they switched away from the "full wet" install and instead went
to some stupid wipey wet thing, I dumped them. I went with the
[[ArmorSuit
MilitaryShield](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=578744&url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XXTRWBL/ref%3Doh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie%3DUTF8%26psc%3D1){.external_link

qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container} and I couldn't be happier.
It's one of the cleanest wet install screen protectors I've ever used,
and it works well with the Spigen case.
