<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [We spend lots of time focusing on whether or not the<br>\"crazies\" get guns. What we fail to realize is how we treat the<br>mentally ill in this country.\<br>\<br>We\'re you aware that the three largest mental institutions in this<br>country are prisons? We treat our mentally ill like criminals. Before<br>someone can be committed, in many jurisdictions the individual has to<br>have a criminal record. The parents of the Sandy Hook shooter \*begged\*<br>to have their son interred because his erratic behavior was<br>uncontrollable, but without a criminal record, he could not be held.\<br>\<br>Our mental health system is a shambles in this country, but hey, we\'re<br>legalizing pot, so that should fix it all, right?\<br>\<br>We must revamp the mental health system, remove the negative stigma<br>around mental issues (some are far more common than you may realize, and<br>most are cheaply and easily treatable), and the natural order will more<br>clearly show who among that group should be regulated.\<br>\<br>Take, for example, me. I have MS, and following my diagnosis I battled<br>depression. I took Wellbutrin during that time. Should I be disqualified<br>because I took Wellbutrin? Because I was treated for depression? If we<br>are not careful, and without a complete overhaul of the system, I could<br>potentially be flagged because of my past medicinal<br>use.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Could-increasing-taxes-on-guns-and-bullets-help-decrease-gun-violence/answer/Phil-DiNuzzo<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
