**Content:** [We spend lots of time focusing on whether or not the
\"crazies\" get guns. What we fail to realize is how we treat the
mentally ill in this country.\
\
We\'re you aware that the three largest mental institutions in this
country are prisons? We treat our mentally ill like criminals. Before
someone can be committed, in many jurisdictions the individual has to
have a criminal record. The parents of the Sandy Hook shooter \*begged\*
to have their son interred because his erratic behavior was
uncontrollable, but without a criminal record, he could not be held.\
\
Our mental health system is a shambles in this country, but hey, we\'re
legalizing pot, so that should fix it all, right?\
\
We must revamp the mental health system, remove the negative stigma
around mental issues (some are far more common than you may realize, and
most are cheaply and easily treatable), and the natural order will more
clearly show who among that group should be regulated.\
\
Take, for example, me. I have MS, and following my diagnosis I battled
depression. I took Wellbutrin during that time. Should I be disqualified
because I took Wellbutrin? Because I was treated for depression? If we
are not careful, and without a complete overhaul of the system, I could
potentially be flagged because of my past medicinal
use.]{.rendered_qtext}
