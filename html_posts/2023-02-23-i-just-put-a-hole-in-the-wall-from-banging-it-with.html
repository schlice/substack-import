A hole isn't something you can "make." There is no "substance" to a
hole. A hole is actually an *absence* of something.

For example, you can dig a hole in the ground, and unquestionably a hole
exists, but you didn't *make* the hole. You **removed** dirt. Therefore,
the hole is what we call an *absence* of something.

Similarly, when you hit the drywall with your hammer, you removed some
drywall. The condition of an absence of something can oftentimes be
referred to as a "hole." You didn't **make** the hole with ingredients.
You **caused** the hole to exist by removing something else.
