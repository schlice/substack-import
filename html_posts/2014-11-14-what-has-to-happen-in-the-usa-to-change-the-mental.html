<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Like other posters have stated, thank you for your<br>rational, reasoned approach to your question.\<br>\<br>I\'m going to take a slightly different tack than the other respondents<br>who discussed what it would take to change the current law in the US to<br>disallow personal gun ownership.\<br>\<br>Your specific question asked \"why weapons are so important to people in<br>USA.\"\<br>\<br>The answer to that specific question is found in US history and its<br>founding. It was individual gun ownership that founded the country. It<br>was one of the things that the colonists were escaping from in England.<br>And it was one of the very first rights specifically enumerated in the<br>amendments to the US Constitution because it was so fundamental to the<br>freedoms the founders wanted to enshrine.\<br>\<br>The Constitution is a definition of what government is allowed to do.<br>The Constitution is supposed to limit overreach, and to keep government<br>to a manageable size by defining the limits of governmental power. The<br>Statists in the Continental Congress at the time were not satisfied that<br>the Constitution would be able to limit governmental overreach (turns<br>out they were right), even though the Constitution defined specifically<br>what the government was allowed to do, and turned all other rights over<br>to the states and the people. So they wrote a number of Amendments to<br>the Constitution to specifically define rights of the people that were<br>to be enshrined and never curtailed. Some of those rights:\<br>]<br><br>- The right to speak against the government if you choose (you would<br>  have been arrested in England for speaking out against the King\'s<br>  policies)<br>- The right to practice whatever religion you wanted, or to practice no<br>  religion at all (the King demanded the State religion be the Church of<br>  England).<br>- The right to the sanctity of one\'s own home (the King quartered<br>  soldiers in peoples\' homes in peacetime).<br>- The right to keep and bear arms (following the colonists\' successful<br>  uprising against the King\'s soldiers, the colonists wanted to ensure<br>  that no one would ever be denied the right to keep and bear firearms<br>  in defense of their property or their country).<br><br>The nation was founded on the belief that an armed population could<br>never be oppressed by government. And the colonists\' inherent distrust<br>of government ensured that these principles were ingrained in the<br>psyche, the very character, of the nation from the very beginning.\<br>\<br>Americans believe that the following of these principles upon which the<br>nation was founded will ensure her continued survival.\<br>\<br>To uproot that would mean uprooting the very fabric that founded the<br>nation.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
