**Content:** [Like other posters have stated, thank you for your
rational, reasoned approach to your question.\
\
I\'m going to take a slightly different tack than the other respondents
who discussed what it would take to change the current law in the US to
disallow personal gun ownership.\
\
Your specific question asked \"why weapons are so important to people in
USA.\"\
\
The answer to that specific question is found in US history and its
founding. It was individual gun ownership that founded the country. It
was one of the things that the colonists were escaping from in England.
And it was one of the very first rights specifically enumerated in the
amendments to the US Constitution because it was so fundamental to the
freedoms the founders wanted to enshrine.\
\
The Constitution is a definition of what government is allowed to do.
The Constitution is supposed to limit overreach, and to keep government
to a manageable size by defining the limits of governmental power. The
Statists in the Continental Congress at the time were not satisfied that
the Constitution would be able to limit governmental overreach (turns
out they were right), even though the Constitution defined specifically
what the government was allowed to do, and turned all other rights over
to the states and the people. So they wrote a number of Amendments to
the Constitution to specifically define rights of the people that were
to be enshrined and never curtailed. Some of those rights:\

- The right to speak against the government if you choose (you would
  have been arrested in England for speaking out against the King\'s
  policies)
- The right to practice whatever religion you wanted, or to practice no
  religion at all (the King demanded the State religion be the Church of
  England).
- The right to the sanctity of one\'s own home (the King quartered
  soldiers in peoples\' homes in peacetime).
- The right to keep and bear arms (following the colonists\' successful
  uprising against the King\'s soldiers, the colonists wanted to ensure
  that no one would ever be denied the right to keep and bear firearms
  in defense of their property or their country).

The nation was founded on the belief that an armed population could
never be oppressed by government. And the colonists\' inherent distrust
of government ensured that these principles were ingrained in the
psyche, the very character, of the nation from the very beginning.\
\
Americans believe that the following of these principles upon which the
nation was founded will ensure her continued survival.\
\
To uproot that would mean uprooting the very fabric that founded the
nation.
