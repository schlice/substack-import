The community is already doing everything they can to support people
with MS. There are whole not-for-profit organizations dedicated to
helping people with MS do anything they want to do. The largest, of
course, is the [[National MS
Society](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=207640&url=http://www.nmss.org){.external_link

offer all of those services and more.

**Understanding.** Understand that for every MS patient, there is a
different incantation of MS. So there are literally 300,000 different
versions of MS in the United States, and millions more versions
worldwide, since everyone experiences MS differently. No one has the
same symptoms. No one can ever understand **my** MS completely, since I
experience it differently than anyone else.

If people would take the time to understand MS (not **my** MS, but the
fact that they are all different), we would go a long way to greater
understanding and acceptance.
