No. That's not why we should scrap the student loan forgiveness program.
We shouldn't scrap the program because of the motivations behind its
authors.

We *should* scrap it because it is **unfair**, **unethical**, and quite
probably **illegal**.

Here's an example "ripped from the headlines" of recent history.

Let's say Trump, as President, decides to ban immigration from ten
mostly-Muslim countries, because he has a visceral, deep-seated hatred
of brown people from the Middle East. He tells his lieutenants to draft
such executive action. Well, his lieutenants know that there is no legal
way to simply ban immigration from a country because Trump hates brown
people. So they draft an Executive Order using the fact that these
countries do not properly vet their immigrants and have been known to
allow criminals to emigrate. While the *intent* of that executive action
was unethical and immoral, the way that it was written was perfectly
legal and well within the executive authority to control immigration.

The purpose of that example is to show that we don't use *intent* behind
legislation to determine whether or not legislation should be
overturned. We only use *legality* of the legislation; how it is
*written*.

So back to the student loan forgiveness program.

Should the fact that Democrats are simply using this program to buy the
votes of young, college-age voters motivate the scrapping of the
program? No, we don't scrap legislation because of the intent behind it.
We scrap it because of the *legality* of the legislation.

And the student loan forgiveness program is **not legal.**

The President does not have the authority to cancel student loans. Only
Congress has the authority to control spending on federal programs.

It's also *unethical*.

> - The increase in the national debt by forgiving student debt (i.e.,
>   much of it is held by government entities) is unsustainable.
> - The mounting debt forgiven disproportionately harms those graduates
>   who have already paid off their debt.

> - Will the debt forgiveness program incentivize colleges and

>   open more centers, and start new programs with student fees?
> - Don't students have a personal responsibility to pay off their debt
>   given that they knew it was coming when they enrolled in
>   college?[\[2\]](#VOKRz){#cite-VOKRz .citation_link}

For these reasons, the student loan forgiveness program should be
canceled. The motivations of Democrats behind the program is not
relevant, despite the fact that their motivations are indeed suspect.
