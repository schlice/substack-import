**Two police cars were responding to an alarm at our apartments. Instead
of going to the alarm they saw my son sitting in his truck, stopped and
arrested him. Can police stop to talk to my son on private property
which are gated apartments?**

It sounds like you're trying to build a case that the only reason the
police were "allowed" to be in the common area was to respond to the
alarm, and therefore they had no authority to effect the arrest since
they were not "allowed" to be there for anything other than the narrow
reasoning of "responding to an alarm."

Unfortunately, this is faulty logic.

Firstly, police have as much right to be in the common areas of
apartment complexes as any other guest of a resident. Responding to a
911 call gives them the immediate authority to enter the common area
uninvited, as it is not considered "private." The only private property
in an apartment complex is the interior of an individual apartment. You
cannot keep the police out of the common area any more than you can keep
guests of a tenant, or even prospective tenants, out of the common area.
The police have even more right to be in the common area than a
prospective tenant. Common areas are not governed by the same privacy
rules as the interior of an apartment, because of the tenet of
"reasonable expectation of privacy." Do you have the same expectation of
privacy in the common area as you do inside your apartment? The
reasonable person says no.

Secondly, the police can stop and question anyone they choose, at any
time they choose, so long as they were legally present in a location
(and again, common areas are not private in the same way that the
interior of a home is private) and they saw something which they
reasonably suspected was criminal activity. They only need to have
reasonable suspicion to do so, and they must be able to articulate that
suspicion to a judge during arraignment. At worst, they may have
violated department policy if they did not first respond to the alarm.
At best, they may have seen something that was a *higher priority* than
the alarm, and they handled that *first*. But neither of those
circumstances are a violation of law, and neither invalidate the arrest.

Finally, if there was cause for concern that the police were not acting
lawfully, the defense attorney will bring it up at trial.

Instead of searching the Internets for exclusionary evidence, work with
the defense attorney instead.
