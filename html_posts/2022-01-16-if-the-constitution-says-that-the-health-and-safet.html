There's a lot to unpack here.

The Constitution doesn't say that "the health and safety of the nation
is the purview of the states." What it does do is spell out *exactly*
what the Federal government is allowed to do, and nothing more. The 10th
Amendment says that everything else that is not specifically listed as a
power of the Federal government is reserved to the states and to the
people, respectively.

The Supreme Court ruled on injunctions. They ruled that *one* of the
mandates could go into effect while the lower courts were still hashing
out the details of the legality of the mandates, and *the other* could
not.

They said, by a 6--3 margin, that OSHA overstepped its boundaries in
declaring a vaccine mandate for all businesses (with more than 100
employees) nationwide. Congress may have given OSHA the power to
regulate workplace safety, but it "has not given that agency the power
to regulate public health more broadly."

At the same time, by a 5--4 margin, SCOTUS allowed the temporary
enforcement of the vaccine mandate for healthcare workers at facilities
which receive federal funding.

The mandate is still winding its way through the courts, but at least
for now, the government cannot enforce it against all businesses
nationwide until its legality has been decided. It can, temporarily,
enforce it against healthcare workers though.

Original question:

If the constitution says that the health and safety of the nation is the
purview of the states, why did the Supreme Court rule for the national
healthcare mandate?
