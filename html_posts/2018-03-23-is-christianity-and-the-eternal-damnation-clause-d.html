**Is Christianity and the eternal damnation clause designed more with
agnostics in mind in order to keep them hedging their bets with how they
should think and behave?**

The "eternal damnation" clause is for everyone, not just agnostics. It's
for everyone.

Because it applies to everyone.

John 3:16:

> *For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that
> whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.*

Notice it says "whoever believes in him." That literally applies to
everyone. And then it says that whoever believes in Him "shall not
perish." This means that some will perish; clearly, the ones who do not
believe in Him.

Eternal damnation. It's isn't just for agnostics anymore.
