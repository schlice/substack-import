**Is it illegal to make a fake online profile claiming to be a minor who
is a victim of ongoing abuse?**

No, it is not illegal. The 1st Amendment protects speech, even when
you're lying.

There are, however, laws against getting things to which you are not
entitled, so if you're using the fake online profile in order to steal
money or donations or to get discounts to which you are not entitled,
**that** is illegal.

But simply claiming to be a minor who is a victim of ongoing abuse is
not illegal.
