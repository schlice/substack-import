The crucifixion was just the means by which Christ died. The pivotal
moment in Christianity is the ***Resurrection.***

***WITHOUT THE RESURRECTION, CHRISTIANITY IS FUTILE.***

Without the Resurrection, all our preaching and all our teaching is
ultimately meaningless. We don't preach because it makes people feel
good. We preach because what we say is **true**. If it's not true, it's
not helpful.

Without the Resurrection, our faith has no power. We have faith in the
One who saves us. If He was not raised from the dead, then He has no
power to save us. True faith is possible because of *Who we believe in*,
not just *what we believe.*

Without the Resurrection, our sins have not been forgiven, and the power
of sin over us has not been broken. Ephesians 2 says that we are dead in
our sin, **but God** raised Christ from the dead to be a penal
substitute for us. Without that sacrifice **and** the Resurrection, we
remain dead in our sin, condemned to eternal separation from God. In
that case, there is no eternal life for us. If Christ didn't prevail
over death, then neither do we. Death is the *end*, not the *beginning*,
without the Resurrection.
