**How can a U.S. president simply declare there will be an emergency
some number of days in the future, specifically pending the outcome of a
funding measure?**

I can only assume you're talking about President Trump declaring that
there exists a national emergency at our southern border.

The President can say whatever he likes; that alone doesn't constitute
an official declaration of national emergency. An official declaration
of a national emergency is made in accordance with the National
Emergencies Act. The National Emergencies Act essentially allows the
President to declare that a national emergency exists. What this allows
the President to do is to "short-circuit" a law, bypassing certain
checks and processes written into that law, in order to implement a
portion of a law or activate special legal processes or protections that
would normally have to go through Congress to activate. Note that the
process allowing a President to bypass a portion of a law using a
national emergency *is actually written into that law.* In other words,
*Congress already allowed the President to declare a national emergency
and bypass a Congressional check in the law that* ***they*** *passed.*

Presidents declaring national emergencies is not new, but you haven't
heard about it because the media hasn't told you. In case you were
unaware:

- Jimmy Carter declared two national emergencies, one of which is still
  active.
- Ronald Reagan declared six national emergencies, and none are still
  active.
- George H.W. Bush declared four national emergencies, and none are
  still active.
- Bill Clinton declared seventeen national emergencies, six of which are
  still active.
- George W. Bush declared twelve national emergencies, ten of which are
  still active.
- Barack Obama declared thirteen national emergencies, eleven of which
  are still active.

Here is the list of the 28 national emergencies which are still active:

Trump was considering declaring the opioid crisis a national emergency,
but instead declared it a "public health emergency," which allows him to
direct the Department of Health and Human Services to do things that
would normally require Congressional approval. Before he officially
declared it to be a public health emergency, he made statements to the
effect that he was considering either a public health emergency or a
national emergency, but he eventually chose a public health emergency.

**TL;DR:** The President can declare that there is "a national
emergency" before an official declaration of national emergency is
issued under the National Emergencies Act.
