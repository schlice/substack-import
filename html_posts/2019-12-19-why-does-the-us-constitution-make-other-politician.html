**Why does the US Constitution make other politicians jurors in the
impeachment trial? It seems like an obvious and severe breach of the
separation of powers.**

The terms "jurors" and "trial" make it seem like it's a judicial trial.

It's not.

It's a political proceeding, not a trial. So it's appropriate that
politicians prosecute the entire procedure, and not judges.

The framers were worried about judges or the Supreme Court managing an
impeachment trial, because that would give the SCOTUS too much authority
and power over purely political processes which did not involve the law,
and they feared giving SCOTUS that much power.

They also feared having the same body pass articles of impeachment and
determine whether or not that person would remain in office. So that was
out.

The compromise was to have the House draft and pass the Articles, and
have the Senate act as the "jury" to determine whether or not the
impeached person will be removed from office. The Senate was supposed to
be the more deliberative body anyway, appointed by the States, not
directly beholden to the "will of the people," at least in the original
plan anyway. Once Senators became directly elected, there became much
less difference between Senators and Representatives (not the way the
system was designed, by the way).

And to ensure that impeachments were only conducted for the most
egregious crimes and abuses of power, a supermajority of Senators is
required to remove a president from office.
