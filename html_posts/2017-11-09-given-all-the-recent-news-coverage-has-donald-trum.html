The simple fact is that, as of yet, no one has produced any amount of
credible, actionable evidence that Donald Trump has done anything
illegal. "Collusion" is not illegal. It may be unethical, but it's not
illegal, and it doesn't rise to the level of "high crimes and
misdemeanors" required to start impeachment proceedings.

As for the other things being bandied about regarding both parties:

- Former FBI Director James Comey

  qt-tooltip="nationalreview.com"}]{.qlink_container} Hillary Clinton's
  illegal actions as related to her use of an unclassified email server
  to transmit classified data in violation of the Espionage Act (18 USC
  section 793(f)). This, of course, was while she was at the State
  Department, before she ran for president. Interestingly, the FBI
  decided to rewrite the Espionage Act on the fly, inserting an intent
  clause where there was none. This violation of law has yet to be taken
  up by the Justice Department. It is currently unknown whether or not
  they will ever look at it.
- The DNC is also accused of "rigging" the primary in favor of Hillary
  Clinton and against Bernie Sanders. While this is also a violation of
  our public trust and possibly what we would call "collusion," again,
  it is not illegal.
- In a highly-publicized meeting, Donald Trump, Jr. met with a Russian
  attorney, who had ties directly to Vladimir Putin, in order to receive
  what he was told was "opposition research" against Hillary Clinton.
  While that "collusion" word comes up again, it is still not illegal.
  By the way, no opposition research was actually received during that
  meeting, and no money changed hands.
- Hillary's campaign also paid for "opposition research" against Donald
  Trump. Hillary's team paid an attorney who paid an opposition research
  firm, Fusion GPS, to produce a "dossier" on Trump which, as it turns
  out, was mostly false. Again, opposition research is not illegal, but
  the payment from Hillary's campaign to Fusion GPS through their
  lawyers may have been a violation of campaign finance laws. A
  complaint was filed last week with the Federal Election Commission by
  the Campaign Legal Center, accusing the DNC and Clinton's campaign
  committee of breaking campaign finance law by failing to accurately
  disclose the money spent on the dossier.

*(NOTE: Please don't bother trying to tell me how bad you think Trump or
Clinton is, or what you think they did wrong. Write your own answer. Any
such comments will be summarily deleted. Thank you for your
