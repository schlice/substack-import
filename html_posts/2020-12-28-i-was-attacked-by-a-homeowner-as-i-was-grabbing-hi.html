**I was attacked by a homeowner as I was grabbing his package from his
porch. Isn\'t this use of excessive force since I didn\'t attack him? He
broke my shoulder in the attack.**

The answer, as with all legal answers, is "it depends." It depends on
where you were when the attack took place.

If you were in a US state, then it depends on if it is one of the more
than 25 states which have "stand your ground" laws on the books, or one
of the handful of states who have interpreted their self-defense law in
a way which allows you to exercise a version of "stand your ground." If
that is the case, then a homeowner can use force to eject a trespasser
from his property. In some states, the homeowner may use deadly force if
he believes the trespasser is going to commit, or is already committing,
a *forcible felony* (any felony involving the use of force against the
victim). He can use the threat of deadly force to preclude such a felony
from taking place.

Some states have a "duty to retreat." If your attack took place in one
of those states, you could sue for damages.
