**Content:** [People like Trump because he has no filter.\
\
A lot of people took what he said out of context. Trump basically said,
under his breath, offhand, \"he\'s not a war hero.\"\
\
He then immediately went on to qualify what he meant: \"McCain was a war
hero because he was captured\....frankly I like guys who weren\'t
captured.\"\
\
Finally, he said that McCain was basically last in his class (or second
to last) at Annapolis, and you\'re not supposed to say that, you\'re
basically just supposed to say how wonderful someone is, not point out
his actual record. He was a poor officer, a sloppy pilot, and his POW
status essentially negated his bad qualities. Trump simply pointed that
out.\
\
On that, I wholeheartedly agree. And there\'s nothing hypocritical about
doing just that. If this is \"Swift Boat\"-esque, let\'s see McCain\'s
co-pilots and comrades come to his defense and claim that he was a great
pilot or was an amazing officer.\
\
Trump also said that he raised a lot of money for McCain during his
Presidential bid, and then he lost, and Trump \"doesn\'t like
losers.\"]{.rendered_qtext}
