"Bible literalists" (by whom I assume you mean Christians) believe that
the Bible never contradicts itself. So by the very nature of your
question, the answer must be **no**, Bible literalists do not believe
that there are any contradictions between the stories in Genesis 1 and
Genesis 2. They simply believe that the two chapters do not disagree as
to the order in which things were created and therefore do not
contradict one another. Genesis 1 describes the "six days of creation"
(and a seventh day of rest); Genesis 2 covers only one day of that
creation week---the sixth day---and so there is no contradiction.

People who believe that the Bible is telling two different creation
stories are, by definition, **not** Bible literalists, and also, by
definition, are not Christian. So all the people who told you "yes,
there are contradictions" believe the following:

- The Bible can contain contradictions, which Christians do not believe,
  and
- Genesis tells the story of two different creation events, which
  Christians also do not believe.

Cue the non-Christians to be very un-Christianlike in the comments and
mansplain (womansplain? personsplain?) why they're actually Christian
and why Genesis actually tells two different stories and complain that
I'm calling them names and hurting their feelings.
