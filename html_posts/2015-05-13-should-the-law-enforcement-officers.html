**Content:** [To be inclusive (since each state can change the rules and
add them into their statutes), I\'ll give you the LEOBOR from the
Fraternal Order of Police:\

- Law enforcement officers, except when on duty or acting in an official
  capacity, have the right to engage in political activity or run for
  elective office.
- Law enforcement officers shall, if disciplinary action is expected, be
  notified of the investigation, the nature of the alleged violation,
  and be notified of the outcome of the investigation and the
  recommendations made to superiors by the investigators.
- Questioning of a law enforcement officer should be conducted for a
  reasonable length of time and preferably while the officer is on duty
  unless exigent circumstances apply.
- Questioning of the law enforcement officer should take place at the
  offices of those conducting the investigation or at the place where
  the officer reports to work, unless the officer consents to another
  location.
- Law enforcement officers will be questioned by a single investigator,
  and he or she shall be informed of the name, rank, and command of the
  officer conducting the investigation.
- Law enforcement officers under investigation are entitled to have
  counsel or any other individual of their choice present at the
  interrogation.
- Law enforcement officers cannot be threatened, harassed, or promised
  rewards to induce the answering of any question.
- Law enforcement officers are entitled to a hearing, with notification
  in advance of the date, access to transcripts, and other relevant
  documents and evidence generated by the hearing and to representation
  by counsel or another non-attorney representative at the hearing.
- Law enforcement officers shall have the opportunity to comment in
  writing on any adverse materials placed in his or her personnel file.

These rules came about because of two Supreme Court cases: *Garrity v.
New Jersey* (1967) and *Gardner v. Broderick* (1968). In both of these
cases, officers were threatened with losing their jobs if they did not
self-incriminate. In *Garrity*, the officer was properly Mirandized
(meaning they had the right to remain silent), but was then told that if
he did not cooperate, he would be fired. He did self-incriminate and was
then charged. In *Gardner*, the officer refused to self-incriminate, and
was fired. The court in *Garrity* ruled that \"\[\...\] policemen, like
teachers and lawyers, are not relegated to a watered-down version of
constitutional rights.\"\

Can you explain why you think that \"questioning an officer for a
reasonable length of time, preferably while on duty\" and \"being able
to request that negative information be removed from their personnel
files after two years\" are disingenuous?
