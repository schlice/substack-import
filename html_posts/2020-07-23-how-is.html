**How is \"In God We Trust\" on cop cars now (Texas+), and are there
others who find this deeply disturbing?**

In 2019, the Supreme Court upheld a 2018 circuit court decision which
stated that "In God We Trust" printed on US currency did not violate the
Establishment Clause.

For reference, the Establishment Clause is in the First Amendment. The
Establishment Clause states that "Congress shall make no law respecting
an establishment of religion."

The circuit court (upheld by the Supreme Court) stated that the phrase
"does not compel citizens to engage in religion."

It is a historical phrase, and the 2019 ruling was not the first to
address it. The appeals court ruled in a separate case, *Aronow v.
United States*, in 1970. Understand that this was about the phrase on US
coinage, but printing it on government vehicles will follow the same
logic. The court stated:

> It is quite obvious that the national motto and the slogan on coinage
> and currency \'In God We Trust\' has nothing whatsoever to do with the
> establishment of religion. Its use is of patriotic or ceremonial
> character and bears no true resemblance to a governmental sponsorship
> of a religious exercise. \[...\] While \'ceremonial\' and
> \'patriotic\' may not be particularly apt words to describe the
> category of the national motto, it is excluded from First Amendment
> significance because the motto has no theological or ritualistic
> impact. As stated by the Congressional report, it has \'spiritual and
> psychological value\' and \'inspirational
> quality.\'[\[1\]](#ZczbH){#cite-ZczbH .citation_link}

So no, it doesn't bother me that "In God We Trust" is on a police car.
It is a national motto with patriotic, ceremonial character, and has
nothing to do with the establishment of religion.
