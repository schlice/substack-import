Besides the control of the unwanted animal population that most of the
other folks here have already mentioned, if you spay your female Golden
Retriever (and likely other breeds too) before 6 months old, they have a
***90% decreased chance*** of developing certain cancers common in the
breed.

Plus, they will never remember, and as an added bonus, you won't have to
worry about visits from Martha Monthly, if you know what I mean. No
monthly diapers in my house.
