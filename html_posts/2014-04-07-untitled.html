**Content:** [I disagree with the statement that someone not reporting a
crime they witness is an accessory after the fact. Simple failing to
report does not make one an accessory, since in general, an accessory
actively has knowledge of the crime and the actors and intentionally
fails to report (conceals) in order to aid and abet the perpetrator. The
salient statement:\
\
Whoever, knowing that an offense against the United States has been
committed, receives, relieves, comforts or assists the offender ***in
order to hinder or prevent his apprehension, trial or punishment***, is
an accessory after the fact.\
\
Someone who simply chooses not to report a crime because \"they don\'t
want to\" is not doing so in order to hinder or prevent apprehension,
trial, or punishment. Although their inaction certainly may hinder or
prevent apprehension, that is not his intention. While we do judge
action and not intention in the law, in practice, the
accessory-after-the-fact law has not historically been used in this
way.\
\
I must also say the same about misprision of felony. The impetus, as I
read it, is that in order for the statute to apply, the person must be
**willful** in his attempt to conceal the crime by falsifying records,
willfully concealing evidence, or willfully attempting to obstruct an
investigation.\
\
The OP stated that if you simply witness a crime and fail to report it
and it is later discovered that you were a witness, what could happen. I
would think that the prosecutor would have to make that link between the
observer and the failure to report; they would have to show that the
observer failed to report specifically in order to obstruct the
investigation. I would think that simple failure to act would not be
recognized under this statute.\

Do you have some relevant case law I can review?]{.rendered_qtext}
