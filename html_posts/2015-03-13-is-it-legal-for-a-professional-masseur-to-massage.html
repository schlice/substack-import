**Content:** [In the professional massage business, patients are often
completely unclothed. But they are always covered with a blanket or
towel during therapy, as only the body part which is being worked on is
exposed. I\'m reasonably certain that women need to remove bras, as
it\'s difficult to massage the back with a brastrap in the way.\
\
Patients can leave undergarments on if they choose, but regardless,
patients will never be completely uncovered. Keeping the muscles warm
allows for them to relax more, so being completely uncovered would chill
the body and cause additional muscle tension.\
\
I received professional massage from a LMT/NMT for over a year after my
car accident. I\'ve done both: left my underpants on and had them off.
Since some of my issue involved my sciatic nerve, my glutes had to be
done. This is more difficult (and messy) with underwear on, but still
doable.\
\
Note that professional massage therapists do this all the time, and it
is perfectly legal.]{.rendered_qtext}
