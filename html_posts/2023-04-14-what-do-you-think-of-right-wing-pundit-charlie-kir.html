I know the people in this Space are entirely disinterested in hearing
what the other side is thinking, but if any of you want to really know
what Kirk and his ilk are trying to say here (which is not adequately
captured in the quote), I'll tell you.

*If you have the freedom to speak, but then you seek to censor
viewpoints you don't like, such as what you call "hate speech," then you
don't really have the freedom to speak.*

*If you have the freedom of religion, but then you seek to regulate
certain religions because they espouse beliefs that you don't like, such
as those which believe that homosexual activities are sinful, then you
don't really have the freedom of religion.*

*If you have the freedom to keep and bear arms, but then you seek to
limit that right in a futile attempt to keep guns away from people who*
***might*** *use them unlawfully, then you don't really have the freedom
to keep and bear arms.*

The truth is that the only people who will be affected by a gun ban are
people who follow the law. Criminals, by their very nature, don't care
about following the law. So they'll be the only ones armed. The only way
that a gun ban would work is if the only source of illegal guns is from
legal sources (either buying one legally, or stealing one from someone
who bought one legally). But criminals very clearly indicate that the
vast majority of their guns are sourced from *illegal* sources, not
legal ones. You might *stem* the flow of firearms to criminals by
removing guns from the law-abiding, but you'll hardly put a dent in it,
and you'll severely limit the ability of the law-abiding to engage in
lawful self-defense.

Therefore, what the quote was *really* trying to say is that the freedom
to own guns means the freedom for *everyone* to own guns, and some
people will use guns unlawfully. Just as the freedom to own cars means
the freedom for *everyone* to own cars, and some people will use cars
unlawfully, and the freedom to own chain saws means the freedom for
*everyone* to own chain saws, and some people will use chain saws
illegally, and the freedom to own fertilizer means the freedom for
*everyone* to own fertilizer, and some people will use fertilizer
unlawfully, **and those people who will use things unlawfully cannot be
stopped by removing the things.**

The gun is not unique in this calculus. It only seems unique to you
because it is specifically designed to kill, and that is distasteful.
It's distasteful for everyone, but we also recognize that killing is
justifiable in certain circumstances, such as self-defense and the
resistance to tyranny. And since it is true that guns are used in
*orders of magnitude* more cases in self-defense than in offense, it is
truly a "cutting off one's nose to spite one's face" move to try to ban
them, and it simply won't achieve what you seek to achieve.

\

*I'm answering here to try to open* ***constructive*** *dialogue.
Therefore, I'll only be retaining comments which are truly interrogative
in nature. Anything harassing or stupid or inane will be immediately
deleted. Ain't nobody got time for that.*
