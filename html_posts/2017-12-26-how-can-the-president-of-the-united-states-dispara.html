**How can the President of the United States disparage the F.B.I during
an investigation and not be considered interfering?**

Either you don't know the definition of "interfering" is and how it
applies to actual law, or you don't believe that the President has a 1st
Amendment right to speak out against the government in the same way that
everyone else does.

As far as "interference" goes, interfering with a criminal investigation
does not rise to the standard of obstruction of justice in 18 USC ยง 1512
(*United States v. Ermoian, 727 F.3d 894, (9th Cir. 2013).* So while it
may be something the football referee can call as a penalty, it's not a
crime.

Secondly, the President has as much right to give his opinion about
current events as any other citizen of the United States does. In fact,
the 1st Amendment is specifically designed to allow citizens to seek
redress of grievances they have against the government. So Trump
criticizing the FBI is most definitely protected under the 1st
Amendment. Not to mention, the FBI works for him! It's his *job* to
criticize them, because it's also his job to make them better.
