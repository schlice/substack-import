I chose to be Christian. My mom trained me to be Catholic.

My Christian origin story (what we in the church call a *testimony*)
began as most Catholics do: attending CCD (Catholic Catechumenal
Doctrine) school during my formative years. We learned all of the
formulaic prayers and the basics about Catholicism and its beliefs. And
I did all of the things I was supposed to do as a Catholic. I
volunteered in every role a lay person could do in the church: I was an
altar boy, a sacristan, a lector, a cantor, an organist (a paid
position) in high school, and a Eucharistic Minister in college.

But Catholicism wasn't a choice for me; I was trained in it. I was
sprinkle baptized as a baby, received my first Holy Communion, and then
moved on to Confirmation (which was supposed to be a free choice, but it
was expected of you, so it wasn't really a choice).

The cracks in my faith first started to show in college when I started
getting deeper into theological study. I tried to understand how
transubstantiation jibed with the doctrine of the *communicatio
idiomatum* and when I asked the priest about it, I was dismissed with
the "it's just one of those mysteries of the church" answer. Well that
didn't sit right with me. And I hate being dismissed like that.

My roommate, who was Baptist at the time, took me to a
non-denominational service off-base. They got to the greeting part, and
*people were actually talking to me! They were genuinely happy to be
there!* I was shocked. Was this what church was supposed to be like?
What do they know about God that I don't?

That particular interaction started me down a road of discovery which
led me away from the Catholic church and to being baptized as an adult
as a Christian. That was absolutely my choice. I wasn't born into it. I
found it myself. And when I admitted that I was a sinner, and when I
tearfully, prayerfully confessed that I wanted Jesus as my savior and to
take over my life because *I just couldn't do it anymore*, the **wave of
peace** that swept over me was unlike anything I had ever experienced
before. It was a turning point in my life, a moment that I will never
forget.

**TL;DR: My birth religion wasn't a choice. My true religion was.**
