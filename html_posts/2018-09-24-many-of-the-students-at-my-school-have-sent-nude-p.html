**Many of the students at my school have sent nude photos to each other.
Why are they not in federal prison for distribution and possession of
child pornography?**

Federal law only applies if the sender and the recipient are in
different states, so in the majority of cases, it's up to the state to
prosecute the teens under that state's juvenile justice system.

Generally, they're not in state prison because they're not adults, and
generally these laws are directed at adults in possession of nude photos
of children. Juveniles who break "sexting" laws are usually dealt with
through the juvenile justice system, not the adult justice system. From
our friends at nolo.com:

So as you can see, it's not always prison time that can be imposed under
the juvenile justice system.

It's also important to note that while laws punish the person *sending*
the message, you generally can't prevent someone from sending you a
message, so the law generally only punishes the *recipient* if they
**keep** the picture (in legal terms, this is called "receiving and
keeping").
