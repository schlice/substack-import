**Content:** [I\'m with [[Bryan
Todd](https://www.quora.com/profile/Bryan-Todd)]{.qlink_container} on
this one. I strongly disagree with the Pope and his position on people
who manufacture weapons.\
\
**TL;DR: The Bible is full of references showing us when it is
appropriate to take a life, and that God expected us to be armed to meet
threats to ourselves and our families.**\
\
The weapon is a tool. Yes, it is a tool designed to kill, but as we all
know, killing is allowed in certain circumstances. We refer to this as
the natural law, or natural rights. Killing is different from murder.
Murder is the unlawful taking of a life, while killing is the lawful
taking of a life.\
\
But what does the Bible say about killing? There were times that God
told His people to go to war. God never tells His people to sin, so
therefore going to war and killing is not sinful in and of itself. There
are many examples in the Bible where soldiers are not rebuked for being
soldiers and taking lives on the battlefield.\
\
The Bible also says you shall not murder. Some translations say you
shall not kill, but most Bible scholars believe the translation of the
Hebrew word for \"kill\" means the unlawful taking of a legally innocent
life.\
\
Also, in Leviticus, God differentiates the lawful taking of a life and
the unlawful taking of one:\
\
*Leviticus 24*\
*15 Say to the Israelites: "Anyone who curses their God will be held
responsible;* *16 anyone who blasphemes the name of the Lord is to be
put to death. The entire assembly must stone them. Whether foreigner or
native-born, when they blaspheme the Name they are to be put to death.
17 Anyone who takes the life of a human being is to be put to death."*
(NIV)\
\
The Bible shows that blasphemy is a crime punishable by death, and \"the
entire assemby\" is to carry out the punishment and kill the blasphemer.
Again, God does not tell His people to sin, so the killing of the
blasphemer is not a sin.\
\
Probably the most interesting passage relating to killing is in Exodus:\
\
*Exodus 22*\
*2 If a thief is caught breaking in at night and is struck a fatal blow,
the defender is not guilty of bloodshed; 3 but if it happens after
sunrise, the defender is guilty of bloodshed. Anyone who steals must
certainly make restitution, but if they have nothing, they must be sold
to pay for their theft.* (NIV)\
\
God isn\'t making the difference in the hour (you can only kill during
the day), but our ability to determine the intent of the \"thief.\" At
night, it\'s dark and you can\'t tell whether or not the thief is
intending to do you harm. During the day, you can. So if you kill the
thief during the day, when you could tell the level of harm that was to
come to you (and the thief did not intend to hurt you, just take your
stuff), you must be held to account for that killing. So what we see
here is that God says that we must make the effort to determine the
threat to ourselves, and if there is no threat to us or to our family,
killing is not justified.\
\
It also goes on to say that the thief doesn\'t get to go free here.
Anyone who steals must certainly make restitution, so the thief is to be
apprehended and turned over to the authorities for punishment and
restitution, but not killed.\
\
Jesus even told His disciples to be armed:\
\
*Luke 22*\
*35 Then Jesus asked them, "When I sent you without purse, bag or
sandals, did you lack anything?" "Nothing," they answered. 36 He said to
them "But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if you
don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one. 37 It is written: 'And
he was numbered with the transgressors'; and I tell you that this must
be fulfilled in me. Yes, what is written about me is reaching its
fulfillment." 38 The disciples said, "See, Lord, here are two swords."
"That's enough!" he replied.* (NIV)\
\
Jesus expected His disciples to be armed because there was a threat
coming. He also showed that he expected the threat to be bad enough that
you\'d \"sell your cloak\" to buy one. Your cloak was the Swiss Army
Knife of the time. It was a coat, a bedsheet, a pillow, a blanket, or a
tent. It was one of the most important garments you could own. And Jesus
said that a sword was so important that you should sell your cloak to
get one.\
\
Verse 38 shows us that Jesus expected us to arm for the threat at hand.
Two swords was enough. Enough for what? To meet the threat that He knew
was coming. We arm to meet the threat.\
\
These Bible passages show us that God expected us to arm to protect
ourselves. These form the basis of the natural law we talk about,
showing that we have a natural right to self-defense. The Bible is the
source for this natural law, as all authority is granted by God.\
\
The Pope\'s view of weapons manufacturers, therefore, is not aligned
with the Bible\'s teachings about self-defense and
killing.]{.rendered_qtext}
