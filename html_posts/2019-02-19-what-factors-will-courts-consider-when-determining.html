**What factors will courts consider when determining whether Trump's
emergency declaration to build a wall is constitutional?**

This will be a quick case.

It's highly unlikely that the courts will rule the National Emergencies
Act is unconstitutional. Let's take a brief look at the history of the
National Emergencies Act.

Presidents were declaring national emergencies well before the National
Emergencies Act was passed, but those emergencies were *endless*, and
the President was assuming power that he did not have, but no one
stopped him because *he's the President*. This is partly because we in
the United States have elevated the Presidency to such a level that we
basically have, almost, an elected king. Did we mean to do this? Some
may have, but I think it's mostly unintentional. Regardless, presidents
assume authority they do not have, and if no one stops that President
from doing so, then presidents will continue to assume that authority,
unchecked. This happened with sending troops places because he's the
Commander in Chief, even though Congress is supposed to be able to
declare wars. So Congress passed the War Powers Act to check the
President, and add some procedure around limited Presidential
deployments and reporting back to Congress later.

When it came to national emergencies, Congress did the same thing in
writing the National Emergencies Act. They put in place some mandatory
reporting requirements, and gave themselves a way to limit national
emergencies by giving Congress the ability to review active national
emergencies and to end them with a joint resolution. However, in doing
so (both with the War Powers Act and the National Emergencies Act),
Congress essentially provided the legal framework under which presidents
are *authorized under law* to declare national emergencies. To that end,
Congress essentially *legalized* and *codified* the process to declare
national emergencies.

Congress also delegated certain Congressional powers to the President to
use during periods of national emergency. They wrote those powers into
the law. There are approximately 470 Federal laws which contain
provisions which a president can activate during time of war or declared
national emergency. Over 130 specific powers are granted to the
president to use during those national emergencies. Congress **did not**
put any guardrails around the President in his ability to declare a
national emergency. They give wide latitude to the President to
determine when a national emergency is necessary.

Presidents have other things they can do besides declaring national
emergencies, also codified in law. They can declare "public health
emergencies" which release certain money to the Department of Health and
Human Services. They can declare areas of "natural disaster" which
releases money to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), among
a few other things codified in law that presidents can do without
Congressional approval.

Since the National Emergencies Act was passed, presidents since Carter
have declared 54 national emergencies, 28 of which are still active.

The argument they are trying to make now is that Congress allotted a
certain amount of money to the border barrier, and Trump is using his
declaration of a national emergency to bypass Congress and get more
money for something the people do not want, and this is an
unconstitutional allocation of money, which is not allowed under Article
I.

However, there is a strong case to be made that the President is
specifically aiding the military in their counterdrug and illegal
immigration issue on the southern border, which is a different mission
than the one for which Congress allocated funding. Additionally,
Congress already granted this authority under the National Emergencies
Act, and now that he is doing something they don't approve of, they want
to declare it unconstitutional.

If there is a strong odor of abuse of power with a president
overstepping his authority in using the National Emergencies Act when
Congress wouldn't give him enough money, there is just as strong an odor
of bad faith in Congress wanting to declare the National Emergencies Act
unconstitutional just because a president is doing something they don't
like.

The correct thing for Congress to do is to impeach the President for
abusing his power, not to try to go through the courts to declare
unconstitutional a law that they wrote. I think they're not going to be
happy with the results.

But why go this route instead of impeachment? This Democratic House
*just can't give Trump a win*. They simply cannot allow him to build the
wall. If he gets this campaign promise enacted, he is virtually
guaranteed to win re-election in 2020. If he gets this, he's a shoo-in
for a second term. The only way the Democrats have a shot at re-taking
the White House in 2020 is to deny him the wall.

Oh, don't misunderstand. They will impeach him anyway, right before the
2020 elections. My crystal ball says that Mueller will release his
findings in the summer of 2020, and the Democrats will have Articles of
Impeachment passed through the House by September. They're hoping, of
course, that the specter of impeachment will cast enough of a cloud over
Trump that they can pull out a win.
