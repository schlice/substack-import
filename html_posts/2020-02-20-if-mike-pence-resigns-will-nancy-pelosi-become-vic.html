**If Trump dies and VP Pence becomes President, will Nancy Pelosi become
VP?**

Excellent question. The answer is no.

If Trump dies and Pence becomes President, he gets to ***appoint*** his
Vice President. The two will serve out the remainder of Trump's term.

The Presidential Succession Act only applies to the Office of the
President.
