The federal government cannot enforce state law, any more than a state
can enforce federal law. So how exactly would your proposal work?

Trump fully supports law enforcement, and has been undoing the Obama-era
federal takeovers of state and local police agencies. So no, there will
be no centralized United States Police Force.
