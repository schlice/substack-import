**Content:** [Of course, it\'s fair to say that guns have advanced
technologically over the years. Everything has.\
\
If anything, though, the gun is now far more accurate, and so is less
likely to injure someone other than the intended target.\
\
The rallying cry of \"guns are technologically more advanced, let\'s get
rid of them\" is disingenuous and logically sloppy. Many things are more
technologically advanced than they were just a few years ago, yet there
is no rallying cry to ban anything else that I am aware of. The gun
simply performs its job better. That\'s not a reason to ban it. Guns are
still the best tool to use to stop a human threat. Nothing else provides
the level of certainty that the threat will be stopped like a gun.\
\
Now, if you want to argue that we shouldn\'t be allowed to use a gun to
stop a threat, then argue that. But this argument holds no logical
water.]{.rendered_qtext}
