**Why is the the f35 so (relatively) slow? 50 years ago, we had the
MIG25 and SR71, which could do mach 3.0 and higher. Why is the new US
flagship fighter jet only limited to mach 1.6?**

First of all, let's talk about the MiG for a second. The MiG-25 had a
top speed of Mach 2.85, which was the maximum speed the aircraft could
sustain without damage. It also had an "emergency over-speed" mode which
would push it to about Mach 3.2. Every time the emergency over-speed
mode was used, the engines would have to be replaced on landing because
flying faster than Mach 2.85 would overheat and damage the engines.

The A-12 (later called the SR-71) was specifically designed to primarily
go fast and high, because its primary mission was aerial reconnaissance.
It could easily out-run the MiG-25, even in its emergency over-speed
mode, as well as outrunning its missiles. But the SR-71 was *expensive*
to fly, and it was specifically designed to go fast. Its engines could
routinely do Mach 3+, and not sustain damage. Its skin was designed to
take the thermal stress of air moving across it that quickly and not
disintegrate.

Put simply, the reason that the F-35 can only do Mach 1.6 is that
*that's all it needs to do*. It simply doesn't need to go that fast.
With its integrated sensor and avionics package, which receives data
inputs from both on and off-aircraft sensors, pilots have more
battlefield and situational awareness in the aircraft than in any other
aircraft. They have better target identification and weapon delivery
capabilities than anyone else in the inventory. The aircraft boasts a
new stealth technology using structural fiber materials which offers
better stealth capability and much lower weight and maintenance costs
than previous generation radar-absorbent material (RAM) which was heavy,
extremely expensive and difficult to maintain.

It simply doesn't need to expend the cost to send the aircraft that
fast, when the lower-cost design and engines will do for its mission.
