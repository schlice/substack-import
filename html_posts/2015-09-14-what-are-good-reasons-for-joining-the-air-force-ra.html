The food is much better in the Air Force than in any other service. No
disrespect to any of my other-service colleagues, but it just is.

The Air Force is the youngest service, only being around since 1947. The
Army, Navy, and Marine Corps have been around as long as the country has
been around. The Air Force is smaller, leaner, and generally less
encumbered by \"the way things have always been done\" than any of the
other services. The Air Force is generally more technologically
advanced, followed closely by the Navy, and flies all of the
reconnaissance aircraft and satellites, so much of their work is
directly tied to intelligence.

It is true that physical fitness standards, and how they are exercised
and measured, are different amongst the services. But this is primarily
due to their missions. The Army and the Marine Corps are the most
physically fit, and exercise regularly, together as a unit. Their
missions involve them fighting, physically, hand-to-hand, on the ground.
The Air Force has physical standards that must be maintained (body fat
percentage, physical standards in sit ups, push ups, pull ups, and
aerobics), but they allow their personnel to work out on their own.
Their mission is not directly tied to the physical fitness of their
personnel (except for some career fields), but physical fitness is
emphasized to a lesser degree than the other services. The mission comes
first.

It\'s a study in irony: it\'s called the Air Force, but only 13% of the
people who work in it can actually fly airplanes. UAVs change that
number, as more people who are traditionally not pilot-qualified can
still fly. In stark contrast, everyone in the Marine Corps is a Rifleman
first and foremost, and then can have a different career field from
there.

That said, the career field offerings in the Air Force are some of the
most technologically challenging (and necessary) career fields in the
known world. The people who work there are some of the smartest, most
driven individuals you will ever hope to meet, who love their country
dearly, and would give their lives in her defense (as the members of any
of our military branches would do).

We do like to do a lot of good-natured teasing of the other services
(for example, our names: grunts, squids, jarheads and zoomies), but we
are all there for the same purpose: to support and defend the
Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.

Here\'s my whole answer in a nutshell:

Note that this is only partially true, as the Air Force\'s whole mission
is Aviation, and this is only an Army/Air Force comparison. But it\'s
pretty much accurate. I hated when cable was out. Because when it was, I
had to go fix it.
