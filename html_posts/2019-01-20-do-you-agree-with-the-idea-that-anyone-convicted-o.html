No.

What would be the punishment? Kill the illegal child? Send the parent to
jail and force the child to grow up in a single parent home?

Is that best for the welfare of the child?

Regardless of the desire to punish a lawbreaker, we should always keep
the welfare of the child at the forefront of our mind.
