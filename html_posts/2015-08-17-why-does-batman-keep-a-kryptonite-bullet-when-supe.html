**Content:** [I never did quite understand that. Here\'s my theory.\

The hope is to catch Superman with his back turned so he can\'t speed
away. But his body is impervious to bullets (even the Kryptonite
variety), so the hope is that the bullet catches in his garments. Being
in close proximity to Kryptonite is enough; it doesn\'t have to
penetrate his body.]{.rendered_qtext}
