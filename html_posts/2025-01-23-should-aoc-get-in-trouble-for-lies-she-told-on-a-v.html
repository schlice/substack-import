So long as you understand what we mean by "get in trouble."

AOC posted a video on TikTok and Instagram explaining why she wasn't
going to be attending the inauguration.

"All these journalists are like, 'Congresswoman, are you going to the
inauguration? Congresswoman, are you going to the inauguration? Are you
going to the inauguration?" she said in her video.

"Let me make myself clear," she concluded. "I don't celebrate rapists.
So no, I'm not going to the inauguration tomorrow."

It's important to note that ABC News just settled with Trump over a
defamation lawsuit wherein George Stephanopoulos repeatedly claimed
Trump had been "found liable for rape" and "defaming the victim of that
rape."

Trump and Debra O'Connell, the president of ABC News Group and Disney
Entertainment Networks, signed the out-of-court settlement for \$15
million over Stephanopoulos' repeated defamatory claims.

There's no reason to think that Ocasio-Cortez can't be similarly sued
for defamation after claiming that Trump is a rapist.
