Since the only agency with the statutory authority to determine whether
or not an officer's conduct is lawful is the court, arguing your case to
the police officer is potentially entertaining, but mostly useless.

Officers are not obligated to tell you at the scene what law they are
following, what evidence they have, or how their actions are lawful.
They are required to document all of that on your arrest report, and
they are required to answer to a judge, and all of the items in your
question are fair game for a judge to ask.

So where does that leave you, hapless motorist, being placed under
arrest? Again, only the court has the authority to determine if an
officer is acting lawfully, so arguing with that officer is pointless.
Comply with the officer's orders, and argue in court where it will
actually do some good.
