**Can a temporary restraining order prevent me from becoming a
firefighter?**

What is most important is not the fact that you had a TRO against you.
What is most important is you being truthful about the existence of the
TRO.

Hopefully you never violated your TRO, and hopefully you are truthful
about it in the hiring process.

If those two things are true, the mere existence of a TRO should not be
an automatic disqualification.
