No. There is always FDA approval required for any "dietary supplement."
It's just a different category of item for sale.

So while the regulatory process is *different*, it is not *missing* for
supplements.

**TL;DR: You must get FDA approval to sell a dietary supplement in the
US.**

Original question:

Can a US citizen legally sell a \"vaccine booster\" without FDA approval
