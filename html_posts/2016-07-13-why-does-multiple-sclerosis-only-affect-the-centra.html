Short answer: yes and no. Yes because the immune system is attacking the
specific protein signature in myelin; no because of the difference
between the myelination of nerve cells between the Peripheral Nervous
System (PNS) and the Central Nervous System (CNS).

PNS cells are myelinated using Schwann cells. These cells can
regenerate, and Schwann cells can re-wrap newly formed PNS cells. If
there was damage to the PNS, it can regenerate, and the nerve cells can
re-grow.

In the CNS, this same process does not occur. The CNS does not possess
the same cell regeneration process in adults. When myelin is damaged by
the immune system in the autoimmune action of the disease, the myelin is
not replaced. What is left in its wake is a plaque or scar through which
nerve signals are decreased. This causes the symptoms of MS. It also is
where the name "multiple sclerosis" comes from: many scars.
