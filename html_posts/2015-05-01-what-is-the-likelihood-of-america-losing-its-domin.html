**Content:** [America will only lose its dominance in the world when
someone proves that it can beat America\'s military in an all-out war.

The only country I could see doing this is China. They have the ability
and the finances to go toe-to-toe with the United States. And I\'m not
sure how long it will take. But I suspect China is
close.]{.rendered_qtext}
