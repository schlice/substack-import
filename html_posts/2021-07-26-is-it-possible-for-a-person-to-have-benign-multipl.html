Short answer: yes.

Longer answer: Benign MS is characterized by a single symptom or a group
of symptoms followed by a very long period of no disease activity
whatsoever. You can't really say that you have benign MS unless you've
gone at least **fifteen years** with virtually no visible symptoms, and
little to no disability.

Bear in mind:

- A diagnosis of benign MS does not mean that you will always be
  symptom-free. A *history* of no disease activity does not guarantee a
  *future* of no disease activity.
- MRIs can still show that the disease is actually progressing but not
  producing any visible symptoms.
- You can still have some issues like MS Lassitude (fatigue) or memory
  issues even if you don't have any motor function-related symptoms
  (weakness, balance, bowel/bladder, etc).
