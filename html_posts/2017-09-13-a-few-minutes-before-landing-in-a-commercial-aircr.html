title: "A few minutes before landing in a commercial aircraft (e.g., A319), why does the air conditioning unit suddenly decrease in power? Is this to maximise available energy for a go-around?"

is correct in that cabin pressure begins to normalize during that time.

Also note that the air packs run off of the engines. When the aircraft
is coming in for landing, the engines are running at their slowest,
until just before touchdown, when they are literally running at idle
speed. The decrease in available engine bleed air which runs the
pneumatic systems which drives the air handlers causes the entire system
to slow down. You'll notice they ramp back up right at the time the
thrust reversers are engaged and the engines spool back up, right after
landing.
