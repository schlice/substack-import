So this is an interesting answer.

The Oil Life Monitor (or the OLM) in Chevy-GM vehicles actually is not a
mileage counter, and it does not have sensors which interact directly
with the oil. The OLM actually monitors driving conditions, driving
characteristics and engine statistics to determine when the oil should
be replaced. It uses actual driving conditions to either increase or
decrease the amount of time until the oil should be changed.

For example, if you drive in warm weather and do mostly highway miles,
you could see oil change intervals of as high as 7500 to 8500 miles. If
you do lots of short trips in cold weather, your oil life monitor can
alert you as soon as 3000 miles.

So rather than relying on your local mechanic, who would much rather see
you change your oil every 3000 miles, you can get a better estimate as
to when your oil *actually* is due for a change directly from your car.

**TL;DR**: The Oil Life Monitor (OLM) in your car provides a pretty good
prediction as to when you should get your oil changed. While you *can*
technically drive past 0% oil life, I would not recommend it. In this
case, you should probably get your oil changed.
