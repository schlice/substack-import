**What if a deaf person was read their Miranda Rights? What would happen
if they didn't tell the officer they were deaf?**

First of all, it's not like TV. You're not read your rights when you are
arrested. You are only read your rights when you are questioned.
However, it's really rare that arresting officers never speak a single
word to a suspect, so it's unlikely that they'd get really far without
figuring out they are deaf.

But anyway, what happens in the interview room:

- You are handed a Miranda card. The detective will read the information
  on the Miranda card out loud while you read along.
- You are asked if you understand the rights as they were read to you
  and as they appear on the card. You must answer the question yes or
  no. You then mark the yes or no box on the card.
- You are then asked if you want to answer questions without a lawyer
  being present. Again, you must answer yes or no, and mark the
  appropriate box on the card. Finally, you sign that you understand
  everything and you marked what you intended to mark and no one made
  you mark anything you didn't want to mark.

So even if they didn't hear the words, they would be able to read the
card, mark the appropriate boxes, and sign.

The detective may not even find out that the person is deaf until the
actual interview begins, at which point an ASL interpreter would be
brought in to the interview.
