There are several reasons.

1.  Bandwidth. That's a lot of image traffic flowing over wireless
    networks.
2.  Manpower. Monitoring video feeds is very manpower intensive.
3.  Return on investment. Very few situations, if any at all, that
    require immediate assistance are *not* reported by the officer. The
    officers usually do a very good job letting dispatchers know that
    they need help. So monitoring dashcams live doesn't get help to them
    any faster.
