**Content:** [First off, I have never been a fan of \"texting and
driving\" laws. Here\'s why.\
\
Most traffic laws do not \"allow\" their use, but disallow certain
behaviors rather than focusing on the technology. Besides, we already
have laws against distracted driving; must we address every piece of new
technology with a new law, or just find better ways to interpret our
existing laws?\
\
The problem with laws is that the underlying technology changes much
faster than the cycle of implementation of laws. We started seeing
problems with texting and driving while people were using flip phones.
By the time most states have implemented laws against texting and
driving, we have moved on to Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, two
technologies which allow you to use the most popular smartphones
hands-free, along with texting by voice. This technology is included in
many new cars today. The technology, as usual, has outpaced the law.\
\
It will be interesting to see how the current technology-focused laws
cope with new technology.]{.rendered_qtext}
