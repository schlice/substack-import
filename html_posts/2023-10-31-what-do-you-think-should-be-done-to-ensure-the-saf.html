Why do you feel that they need special protection outside of any other
American citizen?

And why do think the insane ramblings of a delusional nutball pose any
significant threat to anyone?

If Sheriff Labat feels threatened, he has the entirety of the Fulton
County Sheriff's Office at his disposal; he can place himself under
24-hour surveillance by his own deputies, if he really feels there is a
valid threat.

The District Attorney can similarly appeal to the Sheriff and receive
the same treatment, if they believe there is a credible threat.

Since neither of them have taken this drastic step, it's quite possible
that they believe that there is no threat.

I concur.
