**Which phone numbers do you put on college applications? What if I
don't have a home phone?**

You can get a relatively cheap prepaid cell phone from nearly any
convenience store in the United States these days. Walmart has a vast
selection, and they are decidedly not expensive. They're certainly not
the latest and greatest tech out there, but you can definitely get a
phone that will ring and you can answer.

If you have a Walmart near you (and who doesn't), take a look at their
selection of

is something in there you can afford. You could literally pick up an
