There's an argument to be made that revenue customers have priority over
non-revenue customers (passengers with tickets paid with points, or
passengers flying on passes).

But by the same token, non-employees have priority over employees.
Every. Time.

That's just poor customer service, regardless of what the policy says.

The people who ran the Nazi death camps for Hitler also said, "it's
written in the policy, so that's how we have to do it" and look where it
got *them*.

We seem to have created a world where common sense is actually uncommon,
and using it will cause you to lose your job. Well, I feel bad for those
airport employees because they're losing their jobs either way.
