**Content:** [It depends on the jurisdiction. In most states, the smell
of marijuana can provide probable cause to search the vehicle. In some,
the police need consent (or a warrant) to search your vehicle. If you
are in a state that allows the smell of weed to be probable cause, he
doesn\'t need your permission to search the car. The \"smell of weed\"
is probable cause, and makes the search valid and admissible in court.\
\
In consent states, they can either get your consent, get a warrant to
search your car (which means they have a valid suspicion that you have
drugs in your car), or bring in a drug dog. If the dog alerts (even on
the outside of the vehicle), this would also be considered probable
cause to search the vehicle, and no consent is required.\
\
In your case, your mom consented to the search. The only way this would
be admissible is if you\'re under 18. She is the legal guardian of the
vehicle operator. Ownership, presence on title, insurance listing her as
the primary driver, etc. are not factors. She is your legal guardian,
you were operating the vehicle, and if you are under 18, she can make
legal decisions for you, and these would be admissible in court as
well.]{.rendered_qtext}
