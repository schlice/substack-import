As a former Board member in a Florida HOA, I can tell you that while the
HOA does have the authority to restrict on-street parking on public
streets within the neighborhood they control, it is very difficult in
practice to do so, and their remedies are limited.

If your Governing Documents say that you can't park on the street, what
will happen if you do? The Board sends you a letter telling you to not
park on the street. If you do it again (or whatever the requisite amount
of times needed to trigger action), **the only remedy the HOA has is to
fine you**.

They can't tow your car. They can't boot your car. They can only issue a
fine. And this is perfectly legal, despite what any government agent may
tell you. **It's only the opinion of your HOA's attorney that matters
here.**

Florida HOAs are indeed legally authorized to fine you for breaking
their rules, even if what you are doing is controlled by another
government entity.

For example (our board in Colorado faced this problem), the state says
you can park no closer than four feet from a fire hydrant. The county
says you can park no closer than six feet from a fire hydrant. The HOA
followed the county's rule. But can you park four feet from the fire
hydrant because the state said so? No, because the county made a
*stricter* rule than the state.

The general rule is that the smaller component organization can make
*stricter* rules than the larger organization, but not *looser* rules.

So if the state said you can park no closer than six feet, but the
county said you can park no closer than four feet, this would be
unlawful because the county would be making the state law more lax.

Here's another example. The state says you can have as many flags on the
outside of your house as you like. The HOA says you can only have two.
The HOA has the stricter rule, so it's legal.ยน

In general, this applies to HOAs, which are registered
quasi-governmental entities. So the county can allow street parking and
the HOA can disallow it, and this is legal.

But as we've pointed out, their remedies are limited. And in practice,
it's really difficult for an HOA to enforce. How do they know which
homeowner owns which cars? Run license plates? The HOA attorney or the
managing agency can do this, but it's usually about \$50 per plate to do
it. It's a slow process, and what happens if the person to whom the car
is registered is not an owner in the neighborhood? You can't collect any
fine money from that person, so that \$50 goes to waste.

In practice, in Florida, we had a "no street parking ever" rule, but the
County also enforced single-side street parking, and all streets had No
Parking signs on one side of the street (they were narrow streets). So
as a Board, we did not enforce the "no street parking ever" rule against
anyone (which is legal), and we referred all parking issues to the
county. But in Colorado, there were no street parking restrictions, and
the HOA said no street parking ever, and we enforced it. We had at least
one resident who didn't like that rule so much that she sold her house
and moved. Meh, can't please 'em all.

**TL;DR:** Yes, Florida HOAs can enforce "no street parking" rules
through fines, but it is time consuming and expensive to do so, so many
do not.

ยน There are some rules that the HOA cannot violate; for example, some
states mandate that you are permitted to have a flagpole to fly the
American flag and that no one can restrict that rule. So even if a lower
component entity wanted to restrict flagpoles, they would be unable to
do so.
