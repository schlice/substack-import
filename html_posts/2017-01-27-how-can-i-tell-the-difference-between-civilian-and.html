Unless you know the actual aircraft (model, manufacturer, etc), it would
be challenging to distinguish a military aircraft from a civilian
aircraft while in flight.

If the aircraft is close enough for you to see markings, you might be
able to make out military designations. For example, Air Force aircraft
will usually say "USAF" on them somewhere. You may also see this image
on the aircraft:

This is called a *roundel.* Military aircraft used these for quick
visual identification, allowing others to see quickly which nation or
alliance the aircraft belonged or was aligned with. The image above is
the current roundel in use by the Air Force, Army, Navy, and Marine
Corps. We have been using roundels on aircraft since the early 1900's.

This Curtiss JN-3 "Jenny" has a red star on the tail, and this image is
from 1915. The first recorded use of roundels was the red star on the
vertical stab, used during the [[Pancho Villa
Expedition](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a1a876&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancho_Villa_Expedition){.external_link

a year before the US joined World War I.

You can see this A-10 has a *subdued* roundel on the side. There's
little doubt who flies this pig, so the roundel is more of a marking of
historical and traditional significance rather than identification of a
US Armed Forces aircraft. Note that this roundel will also be present on
the top and bottom sides of the wings, for easy visual identification.

Interesting USAFA side note: during our freshman year, when we were
being filled with knowledge (รก la drinking from a firehose), we used to
do *aircraft identification*. At the time, they would use an overhead
projector and flick it on and off, or rapidly display and cover an
aircraft silhouette. We would have to identify the manufacturer, the
model, and the primary mission designation. So for example, if we saw
this:

:::: ui_qtext_image_outer
::: qtext_image_wrapper
![](images/qimg-de1e984576a354941b024a6f00c82978){.portrait .qtext_image
.zoomable_in_feed
master_src="images/qimg-de1e984576a354941b024a6f00c82978" master_w="400"
master_h="720"}

we would say, "Rockwell International B-1B Lancer/Excalibur, primary
mission: low altitude penetration bombing."

Fun.

But now I can look up at an aircraft in flight and almost always say
exactly what it is.
