In the United States, the law still states that a dissent must be
verbalized in order for the sexual contact to be deemed \"unwarranted.\"
If the accuser was as intoxicated as the aggressor, how would the
accusor be able to say with certainty that dissent was verbalized? If
there is doubt as to whether or not dissent was actually verbalized, and
the message was received, and that doubt is reasonable, this is enough
to disprove a rape charge as opposed to mutual agreement.

The best advice: avoid drunken sex. Too many legal issues.
