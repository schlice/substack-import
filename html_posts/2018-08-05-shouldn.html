**Shouldn\'t there be a law that people who hold public office must send
their children to public schools?**

Why?

Do you think that politicians send their kids to private school because
they think they're *better* than everyone else? You wanna force them to
send their kids to public schools to *knock them down a few pegs*?

Or maybe you think that since politicians are voting to fund these
schools, their kids should have to attend the schools they think are so
wonderful. Force them to "eat their own dog food, fly their own planes,"
so to speak.

However, I think politicians send their kids to private schools for the
same reason that any American sends their kids to private schools:
**they are objectively better than public schools**.

And here's the kicker: this says more about the education system than it
does about the politician.
