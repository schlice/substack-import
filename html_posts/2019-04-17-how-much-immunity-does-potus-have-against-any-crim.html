**How much immunity does POTUS have against any criminal prosecution?**

None.

Let's clarify: the President can't be indicted while he's president. The
prosecutorial power in the Executive Branch is vested in the President
alone. Not the President and the DOJ, not the President and the Southern
District of New York, but the President alone. Any other agency that
prosecutes crimes does so *at the pleasure of the President and with
the* ***delegated authority*** *of the President*. This means that any
prosecution of the President would be akin to the President prosecuting
himself, and I have a strong hunch that he woudn't do that. Therefore,
if the President doesn't approve the prosecution, and revokes the
authority to engage in a particular prosecution, then it doesn't happen.
Therefore, it's highly unlikely that an indictment of a sitting
President would be Constitutional.

***That said***, if a President is unable to be prosecuted while he is
President, then the statute of limitations would be tolled (paused)
until such time as the President becomes eligible for prosecution: when
he is no longer the sitting President.

So while the President is not immune from prosecution, he just can't be
prosecuted *while he's President.*
