Several reasons.

1.  It's not necessary. If there is nothing illegal that they have done,
    then there is nothing for which Trump needs to pardon them. Sure, he
    could simply pardon everyone who was in the campaign against
    anything illegal they may have done, and it would be legal as well
    as well within his authority for him to do, but it would be
    unethical and perhaps a little skeptical. He didn't pardon Flynn
    because Flynn lied all on his own. His lies are on him, not on
    Trump. And he didn't lie about any "collusion" which may or may not
    have taken place, so his cooperation with the special counsel does
    not help or hurt Trump at all.
2.  He could legally also fire the special counsel because he's not
    actually fulfilling his charter, but again, it would not help him,
    it would only hurt him. In a discussion of "optics," this would
    appear very suspect, even though he has the legal authority to
    dismiss the special counsel. Additionally, it would further polarize
    and galvanize those who truly believe that Trump must be guilty of
    something.
3.  Along those lines, it would lead to *real* impeachment grounds:
    abuse of power. Firing the special counsel and abusing the pardon
    power in this way, which would send the signal that he's clearly
    trying to cover his own ass, would actually be what I would consider
    an abuse of power, something for which Congress could actually
    impeach him.
