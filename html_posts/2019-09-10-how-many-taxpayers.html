**How many taxpayers' dollars has President Trump spent traveling on the
Air Force One while campaigning for his 2020 bid, his rallies, and his
appearances to support other Republicans\' campaigns?**

Specifically for AF1, zero. Any campaigning trips are paid for by the
Republican National Committee, even if the President is flying on
military aircraft.

That said, the President is always protected by Secret Service, and the
President has other staff that travels with him wherever he goes. He
sends an Advance Team ahead of him to prep the location for his arrival.
All of this is due to the fact that he is the President of the United
States and is irrespective of the purpose of the travel. Those costs are
indeed paid by taxpayer dollars.
