The question was "Does the US Second Ammendment \[sic\] permit personal
ownership of WMDs?"

Technically, the answer to that is yes, it does. Remember that letters
of marque and reprisal were issued to ***privateers*** who owned their
own *battleships*. I think it would be reasonable to presume that a
personally-owned warship (the mightiest thing on the ocean at the time)
would be equivalent to a WMD.

Practically, we realize that for every *right*, there are commensurate
*responsibilities*. Therefore, some of our rights have *restrictions* or
*limits* on them, because as a practical matter, we are not our own
islands. We must live together in communities and cities, and laws don't
protect me from me; they protect me from you.

Specifically, the National Firearms Act has long regulated **destructive
devices** which covers nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. It also
covers area-effect weapons like grenades or anti-personnel weapons like
landmines, tripmines or Bouncing Betties.
