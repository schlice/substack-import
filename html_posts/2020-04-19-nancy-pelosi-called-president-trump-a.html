**Nancy Pelosi called President Trump a "weak leader" and criticized his
Coronavirus response. Is she right?**

When you cannot compete in the ideological arena of ideas, you resort to
*ad hominem* attacks. When this happens, you can be sure that there is
nothing that they could have done better. There are plenty of things
that they could have done *differently*, but there isn't anything they
could have done *better*.

The perfect example of this: when Trump closed the border to inbound
travelers from China. The media and Democrat response to this action, at
the time, was that it was "racist" and "unnecessary." But now that
evidence has been mounting, it is clear that this action alone saved
tens of thousands of lives and slowed the spread of the virus to levels
we could potentially manage.

If Democrats were in charge, they never would have taken that action
until it was far too late.

So it is clear that while Democrats would have done things
*differently*, I cannot say definitively that what they would have done
would have been any *better*.

So the criticism of "weak leader" is nothing more than an
unsubstantiated, a*d hominem* attack.
