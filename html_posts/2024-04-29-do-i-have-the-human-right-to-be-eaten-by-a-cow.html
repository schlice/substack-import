I just checked the [[Universal Declaration of Human
Rights](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b07f5d&url=https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="un.org"}]{.qlink_container} and I didn't find "the right to
be eaten by a cow" on it.

So I'd have to say probably not.
