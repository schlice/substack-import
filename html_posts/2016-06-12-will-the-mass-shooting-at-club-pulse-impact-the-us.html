**Content:** [Depends.\
\
Both candidates will use the incident to try to gain votes. Trump will
use the incident and claim that Muslims need to be tracked and
restricted from entering the country. Clinton will use the incident and
say that we need increased gun control and we need to better combat hate
crimes against LGBT people.\
\
The candidate that can sell that position better than the other
candidate will get a bump from this incident.\
\
It also depends on the feelings of the American people. If the American
people believe that this was a hate crime, then Clinton will get a bump
from this. If the American people believe that this was a terrorist
attack and perpetrated by Muslims, Trump will get a bump from this. The
government rushing to classify this incident as a terrorist attack may
actually play in Trump\'s favor, as public opinion polls currently show
that Clinton is soft on domestic terror.]{.rendered_qtext}
