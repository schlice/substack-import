**What is an example of a publicly owned "private space"?**

The best example would be a private space within a publicly owned area.
A restroom in the courthouse would be a good example. The restroom is
publicly owned, as it's in a government building; but it is a private
space, as it is one of the commonly accepted private spaces in any
building.

Public housing might be another example of a government building in
which private spaces exist.
