Please show me where it says in the Bible that God allows children to be
raped. Do you assume that God "allows" children to be raped because He
does not actively intervene? Just because God does not actively
intervene to prevent people from sinning does not mean that He "allows"
evil, meaning He "approves" of evil.

God hates evil. God hates anything contrary to His will, and anything
which is contrary to His will is *sin*, and is therefore *evil*. But God
so loves the fact that people have free will that He allows people to
choose to reject Him and to live on in their sin. This really hits at
the heart of why we exist at all, and why God might not be as overt in
revealing Himself to us as some would like. For if the Bible is true,
then God has provided each of us with the opportunity to make an eternal
choice to either accept Him or reject Him. And in order to ensure that
our choice is *truly* free, He puts us in an environment that is filled
with evidence of His existence, *but without His direct presence*---a
presence so powerful that it could overwhelm our freedom and thus negate
our ability to reject Him.

In other words, God has provided enough evidence in this life to
convince anyone *willing* to believe, yet He has also left some
ambiguity so as not to compel the *unwilling*.

In this way, God gives us the opportunity either to love Him or to
reject Him without violating our freedom. In fact, the purpose of this
life is to make that choice freely and without coercion. For love, by
definition, must be freely given. It cannot be coerced.

The simple fact is that we live in a fallen, evil world. And nowhere in
the Bible does it say that Christians should expect God to eliminate all
evil from their lives. It's not as if God promised to skip in front of
us with His great cosmic leaf-blower, clearing away all of the evil from
our path.

In fact, the Bible says exactly the opposite.

> *"I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In
> this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the
> world." --- John 16:33 NIV*

Jesus says that we are to *expect* trouble in this world. That's because
God doesn't promise good days. God promises a *great eternity*. Sadly,
some people look at the depravity of the sin and blame God for not
intervening, when He never promised to protect anyone from evil.

This fallen, evil world is full of sadness and pain. But God promises a
great eternity with Him for those who love Him and keep His commands.
The ones who do not know God and who actively reject Him will be
eternally separated from Him, suffering the eternal torment.
