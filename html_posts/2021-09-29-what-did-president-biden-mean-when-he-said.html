He's trying to be transparent about his true motivations, without
actually telling you his true motivations.

He's absolutely right, by the way. This isn't about freedom, or personal
choice.

It's about **control**. It's about doing what Democrats do best:
**dividing people**, **segregating people**, and pitting one group of
people against another.

And he successfully used the pandemic to do it again.

He's now created a new segregation: people who are "good" and people who
are "bad."

- People who are "good" do everything the government tells them to do,
  without question.
- People who are "bad" think for themselves and don't just take the
  government's word for it.

This is why the government is having such a hard time getting the
military vaccinated. *Because we've seen this before.* I'm old enough to
remember the last time the government tried to force a hurriedly-tested
vaccine on us military members: the *anthrax* vaccine. The vaccine was
poorly-tested, hurriedly-approved, and as it turns out, *dangerous*.
More than 85% of people who received the vaccine had an adverse
reaction, a rate far higher than the 30% quoted by the manufacturer.

Nevertheless, those who refuse the vaccine, for whatever reason, can now
legally be discriminated against, with the full blessing of the
government. "Yeech, who wants those disgusting dregs of society, the
***unvaccinated***, anywhere near where *I* choose to eat? Or shop? Or
recreate?" The government has created an entire subclass of society, yet
again. And the people voluntarily self-segregate, yet again.

You know, because science.

Original question:

What did President Biden mean when he said, "This is not about freedom
or personal choice" in regard to getting the COVID-19 preventive shots
and the following booster shots?
