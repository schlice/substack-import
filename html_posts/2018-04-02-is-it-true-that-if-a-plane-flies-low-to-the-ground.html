**Is it true that if a plane flies low to the ground, they won't be
visible on radar?**

Basically, yes.

Traditional ground-based radar is "line of sight," in that the curvature
of the earth allows aircraft to essentially be "under the radar" if they
are low to the ground. For reference, at 1,000 feet in flat terrain, the
lower radar horizon is at about 33 nautical miles away. So if an
aircraft is more than 33 nautical miles from the radar unit below 1,000
feet above ground level, he becomes invisible. The problem is
exacerbated with small aircraft which can fly very low to the ground
(between 100 and 500 feet off the ground) because their radar signature
blends in to the "scatter" or "noise" from the ground. Doppler radar has
somewhat overcome this problem, but not completely.

This, understandably, is a big problem along our southern border, where
drug smuggling aircraft will attempt to fly in at low altitude,
presumably "below the radar." To combat this, the US has deployed the
[[Tethered Aerostat Radar
System](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e97d3e&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tethered_Aerostat_Radar_System){.external_link

border. It is a system of aerostats with attached downward-looking
radar. This radar can see aircraft all the way to ground level.
