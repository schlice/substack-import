**Biology**. That's how we should define "sex" in the context of any
participation in women's sports.

*Transgender people are unquestionably one biological gender, regardless
of what they claim to be.* This should not be a controversial statement.
Biology is **immutable** (unchangeable), **real** (not imaginary, it
exists and we all know it does), and **binary** (there are only two
genders, not three, not five, and not fifty-seven). Biology is not a
social construct.

Therefore, any "transgender policy" designed to protect the integrity of
female sports need only specify that participants must have been
recorded female at birth on their original birth certificates. If no
birth certificate exists, then biology, not personal feelings, should
determine whether the participant would be allowed to compete as a male
or a female.

\

That said, *intersex* people pose a unique problem in sorting genders
for the purposes of participation in sports, but it is a much less
pressing problem for protecting the integrity of women's sports.
