Because he gave us free will, and he actually wants that will to be
free.

If he were to reveal himself, you know, come down on a massive cloud,
with angels singing and thunder and lightning flashing all around, and
he shot lightning bolts from his fingers and zapped Satan and all of his
minions to the wild cheers and adulation of all, who *wouldn't* believe?
Only the clinically insane would not believe. I mean sure, some people
might choose to not accept him as lord because they (wrongly) feel his
actions are immoral, but they would certainly not fail to believe he
exists.

But that's not what he wants. He doesn't want mindless followers who
only believe because they fear the lightning.

He wants smart followers who believe because they understand what he's
done, willingly, for them. And then those followers *choose,*
***willingly***, to accept him as lord and savior.

TL;DR: He's left us more than enough evidence in this world of his
existence, but he has not given us his direct presence, which would be
too awesome and overpowering to ignore, so as to override our free will.

Why doesn\'t God just reveal Himself and remove all the doubt?
