**Content:** [Whether or not a consumer actually read the TOS before
checking the box \"I have read the TOS\" is irrelevant. If you check the
box but you actually didn\'t read the TOS, it doesn\'t make the TOS any
less enforceable. You positively affirmed that you read it, and by
continuing to use the service/website/app, you agree to be bound by the
terms in the TOS. So legally speaking, whether or not you actually read
it is entirely irrelevant.\
\
This is why the creators of Snapchat carefully crafted their TOS to
allow them to use each and every picture you send through the service
and sell them, if they so choose. While their marketing collateral says
the pictures are deleted, they actually are just renamed with an unused
file extension, plus the TOS also says that they can reuse the data and
sell it. Tell that to the girl whose photo is widely being used as
advertisement for porn sites, which she sent over
Snapchat.]{.rendered_qtext}
