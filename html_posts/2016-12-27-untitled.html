So let's dissect what you said:

*I went through the stages of relapsing-remitting into secondary
Progressive and finally primary Progressive MS.*

Unless you went back in time, you didn't "progress" from SPMS into PPMS.
You may have progressed from RRMS to SPMS (this is understandable,
patients do move from RRMS to SPMS (as it is in the name:
***Secondary*** **Progressive MS**), and it's possible that your entire
disease course was then re-evaluated and found to be Primary Progressive
MS (i.e. no Relapsing disease course first, only a steady progression
with no discernable relapses). So you either had RRMS and then SPMS, or
you had PPMS for your entire disease course. That's my guess based on
what you said.

So how exactly did that work? Did one neurologist diagnose you with
improving symptoms, and then another neurologist said, "No, your
symptoms never really improved, so we're going to call you PPMS"? The
other differences between progressive forms of the disease and relapsing
forms of the disease is *inflammation*. You either have it or you don't.
If you do have inflammation, it usually indicates a relapsing disease
form, where less inflammation is usually characteristic of progressive
disease forms. Finally, in progressive disease courses, you find more
lesions in the spinal cord than you do in the brain, as with relapsing
forms of the disease.

Something interesting you find from the [[National MS
Society](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cd1e74&url=http://www.nationalmssociety.org/What-is-MS/Types-of-MS/Primary-progressive-MS){.external_link

"Being able to characterize the course of your disease course at
different points in time helps you and your MS care provider have
important conversations about your treatment options and prognosis. For
example:

- "If you have PPMS that is active, with new MRI activity or relapses,
  your conversation with your MS care provider could be about starting
  treatment with a disease-modifying therapy to reduce the risk of a
  relapse, as well as rehabilitation to help improve function and
  mobility.
- "If you have PPMS that is stable without activity or progression, the
  conversation with your MS care provider should include the role of
  rehabilitation to help you maintain function, as well as other symptom
  management strategies that you may need.
- "If you have PPMS that is not active (no new MRI activity or relapses)
  but is progressing with increasing accumulation of disability, the
  conversation with your MS provider needs to focus on the
  rehabilitation strategies that can help you maintain function and keep
  you safe and independently mobile."

So how is it then that you determine you have "no disease progression?"
You can have PPMS and have no disease progression for a very long time
(i.e. no new MRI activity and no increasing disability). Tysabri, I
believe, is a very big part of that. As I mentioned, I was on Tysabri
myself for 18 months, and it was the only time that I was able to shrink
some of my 20+ brain lesions. Tysabri is a great drug, so long as you're
JC negative. Thankfully, I am, and I remain, JC neg, because I'm on
Gilenya now, and we've seen a few cases of PML related to Gilenya use.

I think your book idea is great. However, I have a problem with your
title. You make it sound like you're cured. You make it sound like you
could go off of your medications and you'd be perfectly fine because you
"healed" yourself. However, with all of your "healing," you're still on
Tysabri, and the truth of the matter is that you still have MS. If you
stopped all of your medications tomorrow, you'd likely find yourself in
a rebound relapse in short order (6 months to a year).

I wonder if you're a student of Dr. [[Terry
Wahls](https://www.quora.com/profile/Terry-Wahls-MD)]{.qlink_container}
and if you've used the Wahls Protocol to heal your MS. Perhaps that's
what you're referring to when you say you "healed" your MS. You have
reduced disease activity to such a low level that you would call it
something akin to what HIV patients call a "functional cure" without the
lack of indicated disease. You still have indicated disease, because you
still take Tysabri.

The fear that I have, for followers of Dr. Wahls' work as well as
someone reading your book, is that they say, "Oooo, it's a cure! Look
how well it worked in this person! I'm going to go off of all of my
medications and just do this!" It worked wonders for Dr. Wahls, and many
people who have followed her treatment protocol have experienced amazing
results. But not everyone. Studies are underway, and grant money has
been secured, but currently her results, as well as yours, are
*anecdotal*. They are a wonderful story, and great to hear, but they
don't work for everyone. Filling people with hope is disingenuous. Dr.
Wahls says things like, "All disease begins at a cellular level." I am
always concerned when anyone speaks in absolutes. Nutrition is just one
potential cause of disease, consuming too much or too little of any one
nutrient. But it's absurd to think that all disease is caused by an
imbalance of nutrients, and that it is the basis of most or all
diseases.

Your protocol helped you produce something akin to a functional cure,
but let's avoid words like "healing my disease" or "curing my disease"
because these were not done. If that were so, you could stop your
medications today and you'd be great for the rest of your life. The only
treatment that even has the potential to do this is HSCT. Beyond that,
no treatment has the ability to completely stop the disease, requiring
no further medication. It's not that you stumbled upon the cure, and
that modern medicine is just hopelessly bogged down in red tape, it's
that we simply do not have the technology yet to find the cause. Without
the cause, we can't even begin to discuss the cure.

Finally, no one is disputing your results. As I have repeatedly said,
"you can't argue with results." And don't misunderstand, I am thrilled
that you are doing so well. I only caution you to not conflate disease
*management* with disease *modification,* in your own mind as well as in
your book. You are managing your disease, but if you have PPMS, or any
progressive form of MS, you are actually not slowing the course of the
disease, because Tysabri has not been shown to do that. We don't know
how to slow the progressive form of the disease yet, and in progressive
disease, without inflammation, you cannot see disease progression
through scans. I hate to break it to you, but if you had MS, *you still
have MS*. You did not "heal" or "cure" your MS. As I said earlier, if
you stop your Tysabri, your symptoms will eventually come back, and with
a vengeance. Your catch phrases for your title might sell a few books,
but they are not scientific, they are anecdotal. I'm happy for your
anecdote, but it doesn't apply to everyone.

The danger is believing that it does.
