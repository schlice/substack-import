**Jesus talked of the importance of forgiveness, and yet a lot of people
never forgive. Why exactly?**

***Because it's hard.***

It's tough to forgive someone who has wronged you. It doesn't seem
"fair," does it?

But in fairness, no one ever said that being a Christ follower was going
to be easy. In fact, Jesus himself told his followers that life as a
follower would be tough:

> *I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In
> this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the
> world.*
>
> - John 16:33

Jesus was telling them that life would be tough. And if you read through
the accounts of some of the giants of the faith, you'll see exactly
that. Life was tough for them. But they persevered.

We must also persevere, even when God's plan for our lives doesn't
appear to make sense. And unfortunately, that happens a lot.

We may *never* understand God's ultimate plan for our life and how He
intends to use us to fulfill His purposes until that day we stand in
front of Him and get to ask all those questions.

What He tells us, though, is that it is God's place to mete out
judgment, and it is our place to forgive, even when it is hard for us to
do so. It's not our job to judge people. Let God do His job.
