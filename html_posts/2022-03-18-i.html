GET HELP.

I know it's clich√© and all, but please, get help.

If you can't afford help, there are still options available. Talk to any
of the people in the "There is Help" box on this page, who can guide you
to assistance programs for where you live.

Seriously, talk to someone.

Original question:

I\'ve wanted to kill myself for 3 years, and I\'ve been struggling with
depression for twice as long. I always feel like I won\'t get far in
life and I don\'t know what to do. What should I do?
