I disagree with some of the other answerers on the ease at which you can
"stumble" onto a true child pornography site. Those sites are not part
of the surface web; i.e. the 4% of the Internet indexed by Google:

True child porn sites are hosted in the dark web. The web servers are
part of the Tor network, and are only accessible through specific
pathways. One example would be ".onion" links which will only open in a
Tor Browser; you simply cannot open them in vanilla Firefox or Chrome or
(ugh) Internet Explorer. They are not indexed by Google, nor are they
linked to surface web sites.

The main way by which you can accidentally stumble on to deep web kiddie
porn sites (not dark web sites) is when you're already surfing porn.
Some kiddie porn site operators will leave their teaser information in
the public porn ad networks. They will leave a teaser photo or video to
entice you to go to their sites. So if you're already surfing porn, you
get into the porn ad networks and you start clicking around, you might
"stumble" onto a kiddie porn site. If this happens, follow all of the
instructions the other answerers gave (collect WHOIS data, disconnect
your computer from the Internet, run a full virus scan, run a full
malware scan, etc).

Beyond that, you really have to be searching for true kiddie porn sites
to find them.
