The answer is "it depends."

And in the United States, it first depends on which state you're in, and
from where you are "looking into the back yard."

For example, if you have a privacy fence but I'm in my own house next
door which has a second story on it, it's legal for me to look out my
window and look into your yard. It's also perfectly legal for me to
mount a security camera and have it see your yard, so long as it is
performing nominal security of my own property. Incidental viewing of
your property is legal if it happens while I'm surveilling my own
property.

One of the other commenters said something along the lines of "My wife
doesn't care if someone looks into our yard and sees her in the pool or
the hot tub. She's usually nude."

In the scenario I gave (a house next door with a second story),
depending on the state, that nudity ***might be illegal***.

In New Jersey, for example, if your display of nudity, ***even in your
own backyard,*** could be seen by someone who did not *affirmatively
consent to seeing such nudity*, that person could be charged with
indecent exposure. Worse, if a child sees that nude person, the nude
person could also be charged with contributing to the delinquency of a
minor.

So the answer, as with all legal answers, is "it depends." Check with an
attorney who is licensed in your local area to get the final answer.
