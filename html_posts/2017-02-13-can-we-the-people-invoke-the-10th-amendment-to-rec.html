The 10th Amendment does not give the people the authority to recall the
president. Besides, there are no legitimate grounds to recall the
president at this time.

There are two methods by which a sitting president can be removed from
office (and none of them involve the people as a whole):

1.  Congress can invoke impeachment procedures under Article II, Section
    4 of the Constitution for "high crimes and misdemeanors."
2.  The Vice President can step in as acting President under Amendment
    25 if the President becomes unable to carry out the duties of the
    office.

Neither of these situations have occurred, so your best bet is to wait
for the next election and vote for someone else.
