The doctor should, at a minimum, pay a fine and lose his or her license,
and perhaps do jail time. If we respected life in this country, the
doctor would be tried for murder, but we have a long way to go and a lot
of enlightenment left to develop before that will happen.

Oh, were you thinking that the *mother* should be punished? No, the
mother should never face a penalty for having an abortion.
