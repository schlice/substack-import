**Do I have to report rental income if I live in the house?**

Short answer: yes.

If you collect rent from a tenant, even if you live in the house and
you're just renting out a room, you are still considered a landlord and
must report the income as taxable income. The income is reported in the
year in which it was received, even if it payment for rent due in a
different year.

The IRS lets you claim expenses related to your rental as well as
depreciation in order to offset the rental income you receive.

Always seek the advice of a tax professional to ensure you are in
compliance with tax law. [\[1\]](#TAFIg){#cite-TAFIg .citation_link}
