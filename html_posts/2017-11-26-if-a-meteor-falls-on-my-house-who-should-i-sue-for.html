**If a meteor falls on my house, who should I sue for damages?**

You should sue whichever agency was responsible for protecting your
house against meteor strikes. Because that agency failed miserably.

Oh, there isn't an agency responsible for protecting your house against
meteor strikes?

Hmmm.

I hope you have homeowner's insurance...
