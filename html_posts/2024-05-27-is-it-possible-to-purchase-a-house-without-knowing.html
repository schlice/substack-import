Yes, it is possible, but it is unlikely.

In order for the sale of the house to be legally binding, all required
local government documents must be properly recorded. That's why you
complete the purchase at a "title company," where they collate and
properly record all of the legal documentation to buy a house.

The HOA's CC&R (Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions) is the legal
document which must be signed during the purchase of a home. You
acknowledge that a CC&R exists on the property, and you agree to be
bound by it.

If you don't sign the CC&R during the purchase of the home, and the CC&R
actually is in force against the property, the sale is invalid.

You purchase title insurance during the sale of the home, which would
cover this eventuality. The main purpose of title insurance is to
eliminate risks of unlawful filings (such as a CC&R being present on the
property but you didn't sign one).

So while it is technically possible, it is highly unlikely these days,
and the cost of correcting the error (and any other legal fees) would be
covered by your title insurance.
