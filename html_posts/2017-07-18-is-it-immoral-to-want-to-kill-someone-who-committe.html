I just finished reading a book series by David Simpson called,
collectively, the \"Post-Human Series.\" If you like sci-fi, dystopian
future stories, limits of human intelligence, etc., you\'ll really like
that series.

One of the overarching themes in that series was the following:

*\"Feelings are never wrong. Acting on those feelings may be, but
feelings themselves are never wrong.\"*

Likewise, *desire* to kill someone is not wrong. *Acting on that desire*
would clearly be wrong, but simply desiring to kill someone is not
immoral in and of itself. Since desire and feeling are nothing more than
emotion stemming from brain activity (thought), desire is borne of
thought. From the

thought:"

So, in order for a thought to gain a moral component, there must be some
overt action involved in it, which reinforces my quote from Simpson's
book.

To bring it back into context: thought is not immoral, because thoughts
in and of themselves are amoral. Volition or will is required to turn
thought or desire into overt action, which can then contain a moral
component.
