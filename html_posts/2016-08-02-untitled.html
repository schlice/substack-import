Detention legally occurs when the person being questioned "feels like"
they can't leave. No specific words have to be said. You simply must
"feel like" you can't leave and that counts as detention.

If you are ordered to stay, you are being detained. You must be read
your rights before any statements you make are legally admissible in
court. So if the officer tells you to stay and then questions you, feel
free to tell him you killed your girlfriend, because it's not admissible
if he didn't read you your rights.

But how often are you killing your girlfriend? And how often are you
told to stay and then asked questions which might implicate you later
on?

Yeah, hardly ever. You're more likely to be bitten by a shark, twice,
than have that happen to you.
