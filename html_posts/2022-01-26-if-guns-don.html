Needed my daily dose of funny this morning.

**No, the two are not related.**

On its own, a gun is a lump of metal. It does not hurt anyone. It just
sits there quietly. It only works **with human intention**. It take a
human holding it, pointing it somewhere, and activating it by
consciously, intentionally pulling the trigger.

COVID-19 is a virus. It works **without human intention**. Once it
infects the body, it causes issues in that body without human intention.

And now to include the standard COVID-19 mythbusters statement:

\

*Masks do not prevent COVID-19. Even CNN said they are nothing more than
"facial decoration." Social distancing does not prevent COVID-19. It
might make it tougher to get, but you'll still get it. Vaccines don't
prevent COVID-19 transmission. They make it so that the vaccinated
person doesn't experience the worst symptoms, but you'll still get it.
Unvaccinated people do not cause death. Vaccinated people do not cause
death. There is no causal relationship between vaccination status and
death. There is a much tighter causal relationship between comorbidities
and age, and death. Not vaccination status.*

*Cue all the commenters who are going to show me the studies that masks
are marginally effective and infection rates are lower in vaccinated
people, you can all go kick rocks, the truth is the truth. Masks,
handwashing, vaccines, social distancing, power crystals, healing spells
or anything else does not actually* ***prevent*** *COVID infection, nor
does it prevent COVID transmission.*

Original question:

If guns don\'t kill people, people kill people, does it follow that
Covid-19 doesn\'t kill people, people kill themselves and others by not
wearing masks, handwashing, social distancing or getting vaccinated?
