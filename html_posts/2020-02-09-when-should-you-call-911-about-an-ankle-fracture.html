**When should you call 911 about an ankle fracture?**

When the guy who kicked you in the ankle is still threatening to break
the other ankle, too.

Or if you need an ambulance to get yourself to the hospital.

Or if you broke your ankle when you tripped running out of your house
that was on fire.

Context matters.
