**Are standing desk accommodations under ADA?**

A standing desk can indeed be an accommodation under ADA if you have a
recognized disability which requires you to not be seated for long
periods of time.

Standing desks are usually more covered under employees' health plans,
as it is healthier to have the option to stand rather than sitting all
day.
