The chance in the general population of getting MS is about 1 in 750.
Having a first degree relative (parent or sibling) with MS changes that
risk to anywhere between 1 in 100 to 1 in 40.

But genetics is not the whole story. If you take two identical twins
(who share identical DNA) and one gets MS, the chance of the other
getting MS is 1 in 4. If it were all genetics, then the twin would be
guaranteed to get it.

There are other factors that influence MS risk, such as ethnicity,
geography of childhood, and exposure to an as-of-yet unidentified
infectious trigger.
