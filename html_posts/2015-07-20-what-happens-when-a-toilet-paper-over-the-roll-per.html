**Content:** [The man learns to position the roll the way the wife likes
it, because that\'s how happy marriages are made.\
\
I entered the marriage as \"under-the-roll,\" now 20 years later, I\'ve
been officially re-trained as \"over-the roll.\"\
\
I know that\'s kind of tongue-in-cheek, but it makes a valid point about
marriage. If it\'s a big deal to one spouse but not the other, learn how
to compromise. Seriously, it was not a big deal to me, but to her, it
was wrong. So I changed. I don\'t think I lost a portion of my manliness
because I hang a roll of paper on the wall in a different way.\
\
It\'s really much ado over nothing.]{.rendered_qtext}
