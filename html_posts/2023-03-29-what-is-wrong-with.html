I'm not sure what you mean by "selling" the Gospel. [[Brandon
J.C.](https://www.quora.com/profile/Brandon-J-C)]{.qlink_container}
discussed "selling" the Gospel using monetary terms, which would imply
that some wouldn't be able to "afford" it.

I don't think you mean it that way. I think you mean "selling" the
Gospel in terms of "trying to sell someone on the idea of the Gospel"
and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.

It's a practice common in the Christian churches of today called
*evangelism*. Evangelism is the process by which we take the Gospel and
we physically deliver it to those who have not received it yet. We can
do this physically (with a Bible), verbally (with our speech), or even
electronically (download the free YouVersion app).

We learn the tools to "sell" the Gospel through a discipline called
*apologetics*. Apologetics comes from *apologia,* the Latin word for
apology, which itself comes from the Greek word ἀπολογία, which means
\"speaking in defense.\"

We bring the word of the Lord to people (evangelism) by explaining and
defending our faith (apologetics).

If that's how you "sell" the Gospel message, *everyone should be buying.
Best of all,* ***it's free!*** Except that if you do accept the message,
you'll have to repent of your sin and stop acting sinfully. You may have
to change your entire life. So while it is free, it could cost you your
life. *It costs nothing, but it could cost everything.*
