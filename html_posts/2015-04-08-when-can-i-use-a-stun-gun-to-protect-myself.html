**Content:** [Rules about electronic self-defense tools vary from state
to state, so it really depends on where you are.\
\
*(NOTE: My answer is limited to the TASER system, if you\'re looking at
something else, please clarify what specifically you are looking at.)*\
\
For example, in the UK, TASERs are classified as lethal force, while in
the United States, TASERs are classified as \"less-than-lethal force.\"
In most states (42), TASERs can be legally concealed on your person
without any license or concealed carry permits, as they are considered
\"less-than-lethal force.\" Laws vary from state to state. If you\'re
looking at a TASER, I would suggest you [[check the
laws](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b75f3a&url=https://taser.cdn.prismic.io/taser%252Ff4a0406d-53a1-4c56-860e-d96d84bce7ec_state-statute-quick-summary-chart.pdf){.external_link

you are in compliance.\

I would also strongly recommend looking into
