As far as Christians believe, yes. But anyone can be Christian, so it's
not like you have to be Christian all your life or anything like that.

Technically, heaven is for anyone who repents of sin and believes in
Jesus Christ, who is God. So technically, someone who repents of sin and
believes in Christ is, by definition, a "Christian."

Christians believe that Jesus is the only way to heaven.

> Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes
> to the Father except through me." --- John 14:6 NIV

Therefore, repentance and belief, being the required prerequisites for
entering heaven, are available to anyone, technically make anyone who
does them Christian.
