Under Federal law, non-immigrant aliens are forbidden from possessing
any firearms or ammunition, unless they hold a hunting license or permit
issued by a state. Most states only issue permits to citizens, but a
small handful of states allow non-immigrant aliens to get special use
permits for hunting or for shooting competitions.

Immigrant aliens (even if you don't hold your green card yet) can
possess firearms, although many people are not aware of the hunting
license exception, and they usually think "no green card, no gun" which
is inaccurate.

Also, non-immigrants cannot legally purchase a firearm from a FFL dealer
unless they have been a resident of their state for 90 days. So people
on tourist visas can't just pop in on holiday and buy a gun "for
protection."
