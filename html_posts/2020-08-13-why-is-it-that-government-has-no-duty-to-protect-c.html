**Why is it that government has no duty to protect citizens, but firearm
infringement is done to \"protect citizens\"? If all infringements are
to protect citizens, the duallity under color of law for public safety
is by law null and void?**

Logical fallacy.

The logical fallacy you have committed is called **the false
equivalence**. You have claimed that the responsibility of the
government to *provide for the common defense* and to *promote the
general welfare* is equivalent to the police's responsibility to protect
citizens.

These two are not equivalent.

The police have a *general duty* to protect the population *at large*,
in the same way that laws are not designed to protect *one person,* but
all people. Similarly, the government writes laws and enacts policies
which protect the population at large, which is their responsibility.

Keeping firearms out of the hands of convicted violent felons and the
mentally deficient are specific things that government does to promote
the general welfare. These things are not specifically called out in the
Constitution, but are ways that the government promotes the general
welfare in the most specific way possible in order to achieve the
compelling state interest.
