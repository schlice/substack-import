Don't know what schools you are discussing in the US, but they all have
active shooter drills.

The school calls them "lockdown" drills.

In fact, schools in my area are routinely put on "lockdown" when there
is police activity in the area of that school. For example, if there is
a manhunt in a local neighborhood near a school, the school is put on
lockdown.

Students are barricaded in classrooms and the classroom doors are locked
from the inside (cannot be opened from the outside). Students stay away
from the windows and hunker down in place.
