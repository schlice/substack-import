If you didn't believe that Mossad is at the top of its game, then this
attack should solidify it for you.

In order to get explosives into those pagers and walkie-talkies while
they were in the supply chain months before these attacks were executed
is Hezbollah playing checkers while Mossad is playing 4D chess.

Hezbollah is literally going to be quaking in their boots every time
they pick up a communications device, which was the ultimate goal of the
operation: disrupt their communications by making them fearful of using
it. It also forces them to fall back to phones as communication devices,
which can be more easily intercepted.

So we weaken their ability to communicate, and force them to fall back
to communications which are more easily compromised. It's what we call a
"win-win."
