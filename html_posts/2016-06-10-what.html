+1 for everyone who says a physical keyboard. There is no screen-based
technology that allows me to type highly technical emails as quickly or
as accurately as that physical keyboard on a Blackberry. It simply
cannot be beat, hands down.

I do really miss the physical keyboard, and if it was useful enough, I'd
get a BB again just to have the keyboard.
