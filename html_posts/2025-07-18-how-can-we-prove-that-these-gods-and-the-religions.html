Look, this is a really good question, and it deserves a fair bit of
analysis.

I think to really address this question, we need to start by
understanding what we mean by *proof*. And the first question I would
ask is: ***Can we ever really prove anything?***

Sherlock Holmes worked in the realm of **deduction**. Deduction is the
process of lining up premises in an argument and arriving at a valid
conclusion.

For example, here is an example of deduction:

> P1. All men are four-legged reptiles.\
> P2. Zach is a man.
>
> C1. Therefore, Zach is a four-legged reptile.

As you can see, we lined up the premises and came up with a conclusion.
That's a valid deduction.

But it still produced incorrect information. Why? Because deduction
doesn't tell us if the individual premises themselves are true. *That*
is a process called **induction**. Induction is the process of taking
specific observations and arriving at a general conclusion. For example,
we can look at P1 and we can say, "Our observation and repetition proves
that all men are two-legged mammals, and therefore P1 is false." That
statement is an example of **induction**: we use our observation and
repetition to come up with a general principle: *All men are two-legged
mammals*.

Most things we know today we know through induction. But here's the
trick: *is induction ever 100% proven? Can we say that any conclusion we
reach through induction is ever 100% true?* With one minor exceptionÂ¹,
no, we can not say that induction is 100% true, only *highly likely*.
Why? Well, in the case of the two-legged mammal, it's possible that a
man has been born with four legs, or it may be possible in the future
that a man may be born with four legs. Clearly, such an outcome is
*highly unlikely*, but based on what we know through observation and
repetition, it's highly unlikely. There may be a 0.01% chance that we're
wrong, but that's a pretty low possibility.

So we can't really *prove* anything is 100% true, but we can prove it
**beyond a reasonable doubt** (but not beyond *all* doubt).

\

Next, we have to tackle the problem of the existence of *any* god. Does
a creator god exist? This is a problem that we can't tackle with
science, because science only deals with things within our universe, and
if a god exists, it would naturally exist outside of our universe. If a
god exists at all, then it needed to exist outside of the universe in
order to create the universe, so it can't be part of the universe. So
science is not the right tool to determine if god exists. It's like
using an X-ray machine to find a plastic cup.

The correct tools, or proofs, are logical proofs found in the discipline
of philosophy. Philosophy deals with life\'s most significant issues,
including morality, meaning, and the existence of God. Philosophy
enables us to investigate realities that cannot be perceived through our
senses. Therefore, philosophy offers an excellent method to explore
evidence for the existence of God.

In philosophy, evidence is often presented in the form of arguments.
Over the years, thinkers have identified at least twenty arguments for
the existence of God, which vary in complexity. Some of these arguments
are based on the universe or history, while others are based on the
existence of reason and beauty.

We can approach the God question from many angles, and there is no one
best way. But I think there is one argument that is not only clear and
convincing, but easy enough to understand.

If terms like \"arguments\" or \"evidence\" bother you, you might
consider these arguments as \"clues\" that converge and point to a
common conclusion, similar to how road signs guide you to a specific
destination. The existence of these signposts do not, in and of
themselves, prove the existence of the destination; they merely point
towards it. Let\'s consider one signpost that presents a simple yet
powerful argument for God's existence.

The Kalam argument dates back to the Middle Ages but has been made
popular today by William Lane Craig, an evangelical Christian
philosopher. The argument is very simple; in fact, it is probably the
easiest of all the arguments to understand, having two premises and one
conclusion:

- P1: Everything which has a beginning has a cause.
- P2: The universe had a beginning.
- C1: Therefore, the universe has a cause.

So let's dig in to these two premises and one conclusion:

**Premise 1: this statement forms the basis of the law of causality.**
This statement says everything that has a beginning has a cause. It's
very important that we get this right. Some atheists try to refute this
premise of this statement by responding, "But if everything that exists
has a cause, and God exists, then what caused God?" But the premise does
not claim, "Everything that *exists* has a cause." It says, "Everything
that *begins to exist* has a cause." Since God, by definition, and
whether you believe in Him or not, is eternal and never began to exist,
this first premise does not apply to Him. Therefore, the rhetorical
question "What caused God?" is like asking, "To whom is the bachelor
married?" or "What is the sound of one hand clapping?" Regardless of
whether bachelors or hands exist, these questions do not make sense.
They are literally nonsense because they confuse the meaning of terms.

Now that we have cleared away that misunderstanding, let us turn back to
the first premise. Does induction tell us that it is true? Does
everything that begins to exist have a cause? For most people, the
answer is yes; it is common sense. Almost nobody denies it. The
statement simply means that nothing just springs into existence,
randomly and without a cause. For if things did come into being this
way, then our world would be a wild spree of things apparently popping
into existence like sleight of hand magic. Only it would be worse, since
with sleight of hand you at least have a magician who pulls rabbits out
of a hat. However, in a world that violates this first premise, rabbits
would pop in and out of being even without magicians or hats. Few sane
people believe the world works this way. Even the great atheist David
Hume said, "I never asserted so absurd a proposition as that something
should arise without a cause." So, through observation and repetition,
most people, even most honest atheists, agree that everything that
begins to exist has a cause.

**Premise 2:** This claim is slightly more controversial than the first
one. In fact, no less a thinker than St. Thomas Aquinas says that the
truth that the world had a beginning of its duration is only
conclusively known by faith and not by reason. Nevertheless, a host of
the greatest minds throughout history, including St. Bonaventure in the
Middle Ages and Drs William Lane Craig and Steven Meyer today, offer
arguments that purport to defend this truth. An example of one of these
arguments goes as follows:

- If the world has always existed, then there would be an infinite
  number of past days.
- However, if there were an infinite number of past days, we never would
  have been able to arrive at the present day because an infinite
  series, by definition, cannot be traversed.
- We have arrived at today (and today is the end date of history)
- Therefore, there must have been a beginning of time (a beginning
  date).

Modern physics also seems to give weight to this position. Despite
cosmological models continually being advanced by some physicists in
recent years, since the advent of the big bang theory in the twentieth
century, the scientific consensus is that the universe did have a
beginning roughly fourteen billion years ago. Alexander Vilenkin, a
leading non-Christian cosmologist, was invited to speak at a colloquium
for Stephen Hawking's seventieth birthday. There, in front of the
greatest scientists in the world, Vilenkin said, "All the evidence we
have says that the universe had a beginning." It is rare for scientists
to speak with this measure of conclusiveness, but Vilenkin stated his
opinion that it is not just that *some* of the evidence points to a
beginning of the universe, or even the *majority* of evidence, but that
*all* of the evidence points that way today.

**Conclusion**: The two premises are widely accepted today: everything
that begins to exist has a cause, and the universe began to exist. If
that is the case, then the third statement, the conclusion of the
argument, logically follows. We cannot avoid the fact that if everything
that begins to exist has a cause, and the universe began to exist, then
the universe must have had a cause.

This logical conclusion leads us to wonder: if the universe had a cause,
*what* is that cause? The cause certainly could not have been anything
*within* the universe or even *the universe itself* (as we've already
touched on), since things can't cause themselves to come into existence.
This idea defies logic. Thus, the cause of the universe must be
something *beyond* the universe, something beyond all matter, energy,
space, and time. In other words, it must be transcendent (beyond the
universe), it must be immaterial (beyond matter and space), it must be
eternal (beyond time), and if it has created something so massively
complex as the universe, it must be tremendously powerful and
intelligent. Well, a transcendent, immaterial, eternal, supremely
powerful, and intelligent cause of the universe---what does that sound
like to you? St.Thomas Aquinas said it best: "This is what most people
mean by 'God.'"

\

So logic and philosophy tells us that an intelligent creator exists. But
which one? Which creator god exists?

Can we infer things about Him from what He created? In other words, can
we understand the cause by its effects? The answer to this is yes, we
can. Go back to Premise 1 above, the law of causality. One other feature
of the law of causality is this: *an effect must resemble its cause.* In
general, a specific type of effect is nominally expected to be produced
by a similar specific type of cause. To that end, we can look at
creation and assume the following characteristics of its creator:

- He must be supernatural in nature (as He created time and space).
- He must be powerful (incredibly).
- He must be eternal (self-existent).
- He must be necessary (the maker must be self-explanatory).
- He must be omnipresent (He created space and is not limited by it).
- He must be timeless and changeless (He created time).
- He must be immaterial (He transcends space/physical)
- He must be personal (the impersonal cannot create personality).
- He must be infinite and singular (you cannot have two infinite beings)
- He must be diverse yet have unity (unity and diversity exist
  simultaneously in nature)
- He must be intelligent (supremely, as only cognitive being can produce
  cognitive being).
- He must be purposeful (He deliberately created everything)
- He must be moral (no moral law can be had without a giver).
- He must be caring (or no moral laws would have been given).

These things being true, we can now ask if any religion in the world
describes such a creator. The answer to this is yes: the "Abrahamic God"
of the Bible fits this profile perfectly. He is

- supernatural (Genesis 1:1),
- powerful (Jeremiah 32:17),
- eternal (Psalm 90:2),
- necessary (Exodus 3:14)
- omnipresent (Psalm 139:7),
- timeless/changeless (Malachi 3:6),
- immaterial (John 5:24),
- personal (Genesis 3:9),
- necessary (Colossians 1:17),
- infinite/singular (Jeremiah 23:24, Deuteronomy 6:4),
- diverse yet with unity (Matthew 28:19),
- intelligent (Psalm 147:4-5),
- purposeful (Jeremiah 29:11, Psalm 19:1-4),
- moral (Daniel 9:14), and
- caring (1 Peter 5:6-7).

\

So while we can never prove 100% that a god or gods exist, we can prove
*beyond a reasonable doubt* that they do.

\

Â¹ The one exception is what we call the "perfect induction," when all of
the particulars are known. For example, if I said "all of the words in
\[Book X\] are printed in black ink." Since we have a copy of \[Book X\]
in front of us, we can clearly see that all of the words are indeed
printed in black ink. So when you have personal knowledge of **all** of
the particulars, you can make a 100% true induction.
