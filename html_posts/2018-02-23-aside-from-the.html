**Aside from the impossible "coward" excuse - what possible reason would
an armed cop have for standing around watching Cruz shoot up the school
for 6 minutes?**

The simple fact is we don't know.

The way most police departments around the country train in "code red"
scenarios (active shooter) is that a solo person waits for two to three
other officers before entering a live-fire scenario. A solo officer
never enters a live fire situation on his own. Two people is the bare
minimum to enter an active shooter environment, and that's only during
extreme emergencies, such as when there is literally no other backup;
ideally 3--4 officers in a military diamond formation should enter.

Yes, we all want to believe that a solo officer could have run in there
and killed the shooter armed with a rifle, just using his sidearm. But
the odds are terribly stacked against him. He is way outgunned in such a
scenario.

Two things are certain:

1.  There is nothing in the law that requires that a police officer go
    in solo and risk dying to try to stop an active shooter. We all may
    want to "Monday-morning quarterback" the situation and say we would
    have run in to confront the shooter (I know I feel that way), but
    until you're actually facing live gunfire ***coming at you***, you
    don't know exactly how you'll react. But the fact of the matter is
    that a police officer's job description does not say "Gets killed
    when necessary." And many years of case law backs this up: police
    have a general duty to protect the public at large; they have no
    specific duty to protect any one person or any group of people. So
    legally, he did not abdicate his duty or anything like that. He
    contained the situation, which is legally permissible.
2.  We also don't know the code red rules in that department. Was the
    deputy required to hole up and wait for backup? Was he directed to
    not enter the school until backup arrived? In other words, did he
    follow his department's rules? We don't know any of that either. But
    we do know that a dead officer won't do anyone any good. He
    certainly contained the situation even if he didn't go in, and that
    meets the legal standard of "doing his job." The department hasn't
    come out and said yet whether or not the officer was following
    orders, or following department operating procedure for code red
    scenarios. Interesting why they haven't said anything. Probably has
    something to do with the fact that the answer may be tough for
    people to hear.
