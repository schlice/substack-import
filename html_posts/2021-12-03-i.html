Well [[David
D](https://www.quora.com/profile/David-D-960)]{.qlink_container}, you
either have the strangest-sounding girl's name, or you need to do a
better job creating a fake account, which incidentally has not added any
other content to Quora (like, literally none) except for this question.
PRO TIP: if you're going to claim you are a 23 year old female, you
should have a name which could reasonably be construed to be a 23 year
old female (and maybe find a random picture on the Internet to be your
account picture; it might make the lie more believable).

As if this particular troll question actually needs an answer, but I
feel compelled to nip this little desperate attempt to fulfill a sexual
fantasy in the bud.

In nearly every country in the world, masturbation or any other sex act
is not a covered health care service. No health care worker who wants to
keep their job would ever masturbate a patient. Think about it. A paid
worker providing sex services is not a health care worker. She is a
prostitute. Maybe prostitution is legal in your country; in that case,
maybe you could hire a prostitute to help the boy out, if he can legally
receive those services in your country.

But health care workers cannot perform sex acts on their patients. That
is the stuff of the evening news, not a proper health care service.
