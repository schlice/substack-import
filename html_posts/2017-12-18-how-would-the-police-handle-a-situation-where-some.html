First of all, preventing someone from driving drunk should never
escalate to the point of physical violence. The most physical you should
ever get is taking their keys. The police should never be involved.

Because if the police get involved, they will wait until the drunk
person gets behind the wheel, and then arrest the drunk person for DUI.
You don't actually have to be "driving" the vehicle before you can be
arrested for DUI. But the bottom line is that this "friend" of yours
will end up in jail if you get the police involved.
