**Do you think that the homeowners\' association should be made
illegal?**

Of course not. There are *far* better choices available than forcing
communities to abandon HOAs, especially if the community wants the HOA.

- If a community decides they don't want a homeowner's association, they
  can dissolve it. It requires a real estate attorney's assistance
  (because there are things which need to be done, like dealing with
  HOA-owned properties), and depending on where you live, it could
  require either a supermajority or a unanimous vote of the members of
  that HOA. But this decision should be made by the whole community, not
  just by one or two people.
- The homeowner is always free to sell his home and move to a community
  which is not governed by an HOA. Even in our community which is, by a
  large majority, in favor of our HOA, there were several homeowners who
  were so against HOAs in general, and their restrictions in specific,
  that they sold their homes and moved to locations not governed by
  HOAs.

The decision to keep or disband the HOA is something that should be left
to the residents of that community, not the government forcing
communities to abandon HOAs that they may want.
