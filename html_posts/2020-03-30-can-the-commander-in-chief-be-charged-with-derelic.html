**Can the Commander-in-Chief be charged with dereliction of duty?**

No, because the President is not a member of the military.

The Commander-in-Chief is not ***at*** the top of the military chain of
command. He is ***above*** the military chain of command, ***outside***
the military chain of command, and is thus not subject to the UCMJ.

There are already remedies listed in the Constitution for punishing a
President for conduct which might be criminal (see *Impeachment*).
