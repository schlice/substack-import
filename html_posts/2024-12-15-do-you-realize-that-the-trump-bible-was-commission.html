Thank you for giving me the opportunity to finally debunk some of the
myths about "the Trump Bible" that have been circulating around the
Internet for a while now.

Let me just start by saying I take issue with the "God Bless the USA
Bible," also known as the "Trump Bible" because it was endorsed by
President Trump along with Lee Greenwood (who wrote the song "God Bless
The USA"). For brevity's sake (and because I'm lazy and don't want to
type out its proper name every time) we'll just call it "The Trump
Bible."

The Trump Bible is a leather-bound Bible with an embossed American flag
on the front, and it contains the King James Version of the Bible, along
with the Founding Documents (the Declaration of Independence, the
Constitution, the Pledge of Allegiance) and the lyrics to the song "God
Bless The USA" in Lee Greenwood's own handwriting. It was supposed to
contain the New International Version of the Bible, but Zondervan (the
publisher of the NIV) withdrew their version of the Bible after public
criticism. Instead, the KJV was included because it is already part of
the Public Domain and is not under copyright restrictions.

I take issue with the Bible being lumped together with our nation's
founding documents. Doing so tends to equate (at some level) our
founding documents with the Bible. While our nation was indeed founded
on a Judeo-Christian heritage, that does not put our founding documents
on par with the Bible. They are certainly great documents, *but they
don't hold a candle to the Bible.* Putting them together in a single
book tends to both improperly elevate our founding documents, and water
down the Bible. The Bible should stand *alone* as the inspired Word of
God, as the founding documents, while pretty great in their own right,
are not the inspired word of God.

- The Trump Bible was commissioned by the False Prophet.

First of all, there is no one "false prophet." There have been many
false prophets even before Jesus, and there have been many since. And if
you're talking about ***THE*** False Prophet, as far as we know, he
hasn't come yet.

- It was made in China

So? A lot of stuff is made in China. I bet some of the hard copy
printings of the Bible were printed in China. And it's not like they
altered the Bible: the content of the King James Version was not
altered, and we have enough copies of the King James Version to be able
to tell pretty quickly if something was altered.

- and sold for profit

Again, so what? The book actually costs money to make, so sometimes you
have to sell the book at a profit to pay for all of the costs in
manufacturing the book. If you don't want to pay for the Bible, you have
the Internet. Granted, the price was a little high for what you got, but
some people like that kind of stuff.

But you never need to pay to read the Bible. If you're reading this, you
clearly have internet access, so you can click this link to go to
[[bible.com](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9cd4c8&url=https://www.bible.com){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="bible.com"}]{.qlink_container} and read every modern
translation of the Bible for free. You can check the Bible out of your
local library for free if you don't have Internet access, but if you
want to buy a hard copy from a bookstore, expect to pay real money for
it.

- It is Satan\'s tool to defile God\'s word using MAGAs praying to Trump
  instead of God and worship him as a living idol, the greatest
  heresies.

C'mon now, really? It's the King James Version of the Bible. No one is
praying to Trump unless they're idiots. No one worships Trump as a god.
Sure, plenty of people like him because he gives them a voice when they
never had one. But a god? I'm sure there are a few whack jobs out there
who think that Trump was ordained by God, but for the ***vast
majority*** of people, Trump is just a guy, and a flawed one at that.

So maybe tone down the rhetoric a little.
