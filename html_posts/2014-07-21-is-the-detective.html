\
The detective is never fortunate enough to have the solution right under
his nose. In the case of my big Italian schnoz, if it was there, I
likely would miss it too.\
\
From what I know of actual detectives (I was raised by one), the clues
aren\'t elusive. They are right there, staring you plainly in the face,
not hiding under your nose (regardless of how big it may be). It is the
**[facts]{.underline}**, on the other hand, that take a great deal of
hard work to find, and often are still elusive. I have witnessed
investigations that have gone on for months and have produced nothing. I
have witnessed others that have gone on for months and finally revealed
something which the detective could use to find and close in on the
criminal and eventually arrest (and hold) the same criminal.\
\
The Detective\'s Curse, therefore, in my opinion, is knowing exactly who
did it and how they did it, but being unable to prove it with hard
evidence, and having \"the establishment\" try to thwart your efforts at
every turn.
