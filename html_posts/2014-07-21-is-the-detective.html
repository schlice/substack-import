<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [HuffPo was kind enough to provide [[the details of that<br>show](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8ea6e8&url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/zoe-triska/every-clue-revealed-in-true-detective-episode-4_b_4759353.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="huffingtonpost.com"}]{.qlink_container} and a few salient<br>facts. The most important one:\<br>\<br>]<br><br>> CLUE FIVE: He mentions that it\'s the detectives curse to have the<br>> solution right under your nose, but to be paying attention to the<br>> wrong clues.<br><br>\<br>The detective is never fortunate enough to have the solution right under<br>his nose. In the case of my big Italian schnoz, if it was there, I<br>likely would miss it too.\<br>\<br>From what I know of actual detectives (I was raised by one), the clues<br>aren\'t elusive. They are right there, staring you plainly in the face,<br>not hiding under your nose (regardless of how big it may be). It is the<br>facts{.underline}, on the other hand, that take a great deal of<br>hard work to find, and often are still elusive. I have witnessed<br>investigations that have gone on for months and have produced nothing. I<br>have witnessed others that have gone on for months and finally revealed<br>something which the detective could use to find and close in on the<br>criminal and eventually arrest (and hold) the same criminal.\<br>\<br>The Detective\'s Curse, therefore, in my opinion, is knowing exactly who<br>did it and how they did it, but being unable to prove it with hard<br>evidence, and having \"the establishment\" try to thwart your efforts at<br>every turn.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
