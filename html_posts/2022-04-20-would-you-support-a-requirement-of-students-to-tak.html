I took a World Religions class in college. Granted, it was an elective,
but it gave me the insight to understand how to answer this question.

And the answer is: **in no way should such a class ever become a
requirement.**

Why is that?

Simple. My final exam was *one single essay question* and it was simply
an exercise in finding the "common thread" throughout all world
religions. The question was a pluralistic-style question which basically
said, as its subtone, "What you've learned throughout your time in this
class is that all major religions teach the same thing. They all see the
same God in different ways."

This is, quite simply put, untrue.

While most major world religions share some moral foundations (as they
should, since morals are inborn gifts of our Creator), the major world
religions differ on just about everything else. The nature of God, the
nature of man, sin, salvation, heaven, hell, and creation. They differ
on all of it.

And while most religions have some beliefs that are true, not all
religious beliefs are true, because they are *mutually exclusive*. That
means that some beliefs must be wrong. But in America (as this class
taught), you're not supposed to say that. You're supposed to be
"tolerant" of all other religions, and "tolerance" today doesn't mean
simply accepting that other people believe differently than you, even if
it is false. "Tolerance" today means *you must accept that every one of
their beliefs is as true as yours.*

Not only is this idea wrong, it's dangerously wrong. For example, if
Christianity is true, then there would be eternal consequences to not
being Christian. Similarly, if Islam is true, there would be eternal
consequences to not being Muslim.

Additionally, the pluralistic view that all religions must be right is,
in itself, an absolute moral position. Why can't we question the truth
of other's beliefs? Is it immoral to do so? And by whose standards? Do
the pluralists have any evidence to support the moral imperative to
*not* question anyone else's beliefs? Or is it just their own opinion
that they are using the educational system to impose on everyone else?

As you can see, there are some pretty significant dangers which would
have to be ironed out of any World Religions class before it should ever
be offered, and definitely before it ever becomes a mandatory offering.
