**Content:** [I have seen firsthand what marijuana can do to a person
who has an addictive personality (i.e. someone who can become an
addict). I\'ve seen people who have used all manner of illicit drugs and
then drop them on a dime without any ill effects, and I\'ve seen others
get hooked on drugs that some might think are almost \"benign.\"
Marijuana, for all of its benefits, is not harmless.\
\
Marijuana is a gateway drug. Because when marijuana quits doing it for
you, you start looking for the next big thing. Generally it\'s black tar
because it\'s (relatively) cheap and easy to get.\
\
Medical marijuana just sends the message to teens that it\'s okay to use
because it\'s \"medical.\" It\'s a medicine; it can\'t be bad for you,
right? And since you can\'t legally write a prescription for it, you
only need a doctor\'s \"note\" to get it. Plenty of doctors are more
than willing to write a note for you. Actually, here in Colorado, they
work in the pot store.\
\
I was in a small town here (which shall remain unnamed) and the sign
outside the pot store had two arrows to their two storefront locations.
The arrow to the left said \"18+\" and the arrow to the right said
\"21+\". The sign next to it clarified: the arrow to the left said
\"Medical\" and the arrow to the right said \"Recreational.\" The only
difference between the two stores: the \"recreational\" store charges
tax. No tax is charged for \"medical\" marijuana.\
\
Stats from two years ago showed that there were 110,000 people in the
state with their medical marijuana cards, and that current estimates put
it at approximately 10,000 that actually needed them.\
\
One of the other things that legalization here has done is given us the
ability to test it more. We\'ve found how detrimental it is to the
maturing brain. It is actually far more harmful to the maturing brain
than was first thought. Really, no one under age 25 should touch the
stuff because brains in humans reach their maximum maturity at age 25;
they are still maturing before then.\
\
Oh, and that awesome tax revenue? The governor was asked what he was
going to do with that amazing windfall he received from marijuana sales,
and in his brilliance, he said he was going to invest it in drug rehab
and drug prevention programs. Welcome to Colorado; see what incredible
things you can do when the state turns blue?\
\
So the LE professional in me says that it\'s a complete waste of time,
money and effort to continue to fight the war on drugs, and the parent
in me says we\'re only hurting ourselves by letting our kids think that
it\'s okay to use because it\'s \"medical.\" So far, I\'m finding that
we\'re not doing ourselves any favors.]{.rendered_qtext}
