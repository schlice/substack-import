"Did God act morally."

What an interesting question.

If God can act *immorally*, then there must be a standard of morals that
transcends God. If you can name that standard which is *higher* than the
*highest creature ever,* greater than the **all-powerful Creator of the
Universe**, then perhaps we can judge God by that standard.

But I have a feeling that you do not know the source of the morality by
which you hope to judge God.

Therefore, in order to answer your question, I must ask you to **ground
your morality**. You must tell me the source of the morality by which
you can judge God, and it must be a standard of morality outside of God,
to which God is subject.

If we can agree on that standard of morality, we can judge God.

\

And what my "gut" says is wholly irrelevant. That's you asking me to use
"my gut" (or my feelings, essentially) to be the yardstick by which I
judge the morality of God.

What difference does it make if I don't like God's decisions? In the
grand scheme of things, I am nothing and He is everything. I am the
clay, He is the potter. He is wholly within His rights to smash me down
to nothing and rebuild me, or simply throw me into the discard pile.
Does the clay have a right to complain to the potter about how it has
been formed? Does the clay have a right to object to how the potter
treats the rest of the clay?

I'm not seeing where "my gut" holds any sway over the Almighty Creator
of the Universeâ„¢.
