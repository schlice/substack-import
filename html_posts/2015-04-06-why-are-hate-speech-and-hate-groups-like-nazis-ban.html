**Content:** [\"Hate speech\" is actually a crime in the United States.
\"Hate groups\" are not.\
\
Speech that \"incites riots\" is illegal in this country, and we have
recently passed \"hate speech\" laws which attempts to determine what
the speaker was thinking at the time he spoke, and if we determine that
the person was speaking with an animosity to a specific protected class
in society, we can add the qualifier \"hate speech\" to any crime
involving speech, which increases penalties.\
\
Since free association is still legal under the First Amendment, any
group is free to associate. We do not ban any particular group from
associating. Many incidents of Nazi impersonators are documented where
local authorities requested that these people remove their swastikas for
fear of inciting riots.]{.rendered_qtext}
