**Content:** [There are two reasons that old, unenforced laws remain on
the books:\
\
1. Historical reference. Even the laws in a state show their own
historical roots, and can be used for historical reference. Removing old
laws removes the historical references which are present by their very
existence.\
2. Cost. It\'s expensive to change the law in a state. Law reference
books need addendums, posters need to be re-printed, etc. If the law is
not being enforced, why spend extra money when nothing is to be gained
from it?]{.rendered_qtext}
