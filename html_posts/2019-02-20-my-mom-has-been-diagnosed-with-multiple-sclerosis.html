I wanted to write a big meta-answer that encompassed all kinds of other
answers, but instead settled on writing one basic answer and telling you
all that you can search Quora for other answers to each one of those
questions.

**My mom has been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. What does this
mean?**

Multiple Sclerosis is an autoimmune disease. That means that the body's
immune system gets a little fouled up and mistakenly recognizes normal,
healthy body tissues as foreign invaders and attacks them.

In MS, the immune system attacks the myelin sheath surrounding nerve
fibers in the Central Nervous System (CNS) and destroys it. It leaves in
its wake hard scars of cholesterol called *scleroses*. Nerve signals do
not flow well through these areas of *demyelination*. These damaged
nerve fibers cause the varied symptoms of MS. This is also where the
name comes from: *multiple sclerosis = many scars.*

**What can I expect to happen?**

Your mom already likely has experienced some symptoms of the disease.
That's usually how we know that someone has MS: they experience
symptoms. The symptoms are caused by areas of nerve which have been
damaged. There are *many* symptoms which can be caused by MS, and
everyone who gets MS gets different symptoms. Even when two people
experience the same symptoms, they may experience those symptoms
slightly differently. In other words, everyone who has MS experiences it
a little bit differently, and not everyone will experience all symptoms.

There are two main forms of the disease: a **relapsing** form, and a
**progressive** form. In the relapsing form (the most common), patients
will experience periods of disease activity (relapses or exacerbations)
followed by longer periods of symptom inactivity (remission). In the
progressive forms of the disease, there may be periods of relapse, but
there are fewer periods of remission. In some, the disease symptoms
appear and slowly get worse over time.

The most common symptoms of MS are:

- Bladder Dysfunction
- Bowel Dysfunction
- Changes in Cognitive Function, including problems with memory,
  attention, and problem-solving
- Dizziness and Vertigo
- Depression and other Emotional Changes
- Fatigue (also called MS lassitude)
- Difficulty in Walking and/or Balance or Coordination Problems
- Abnormal sensations such as Numbness or "pins and needles"
- Sexual Dysfunction
- Spasticity
- Vision Problems (Optic Neuritis)

Less common symptoms include:

- Headache
- Hearing Loss
- Itching
- Seizures
- Speech Disorders
- Dysphagia (Swallowing Problems)
- Tremor

**What causes it?**

We don't know what causes MS. Anyone can get multiple sclerosis, but
there are risk factors that place one at higher risk of developing the
disease. These risk factors include sex, family history, ethnicity,
geography of birth and childhood, and exposure to an as-of-yet
unidentified infectious trigger.\
\
**SEX**: Females are two to three times more likely to develop MS than
males. Scientists believe that one\'s tendency to develop MS therefore
has some hormonal connection.\
\
**FAMILY** **HISTORY**: Statistics show that the chance of the average
person in the United States developing MS is about 1 in 750. But close
(first-degree) relatives of people with MS, such as children, siblings
or non-identical twins, have a higher chance, anywhere from one in 100
to one in 40. It\'s not all genetic, though, and you can see this
through the \"identical twin\" example. If one identical twin has MS,
the other twin (who has the identical gene structure as the twin) has
only a 1 in 4 chance of developing MS. If it were all genetic, the
unaffected twin would have a 100% chance of developing MS instead of the
25% chance they exhibit today.\
\
**ETHNICITY**: MS is more common among Caucasians (particularly those of
northern European ancestry) than other ethnic groups, and is almost
unheard of in some populations, such as Inuit, Yakutes, Hutterites,
Hungarian Romani, Norwegian Lapps, Australian Aborigines, and New
Zealand Maoris.\
\
**GEOGRAPHY**: MS occurs with greatest frequency in higher latitudes
(above 40Â° latitude) away from the equator, than in lower latitudes,
closer to the equator. This may have something to do with vitamin D
production in the skin, and the vitamin\'s prophylactic effect on the
development of MS. The exact details about vitamin D\'s involvement with
the prevention of MS, however, is still unclear. Moving from one
geographic area to another seems to alter a person\'s risk of developing
MS. Studies show that families and their children will assume the new
risk level (higher or lower) of the area to which they move. Those who
move before the age of 15 generally take on the new risk themselves.
Those who move after the age of 15 may not see the new risk appear until
the next generation.\
\
**INFECTIOUS** **TRIGGER**: Scientists have been searching for years for
an infectious agent that might trigger MS. While many different viruses
have been suggested, including rabies, herpes simplex virus, measles,
corona virus, canine distemper virus, HTLV-1, Epstein-Barr virus, among
others, none has yet been confirmed. Chlamydia pneumoniae, a bacteria
which 90% of the population has been exposed to over their lifetime, has
also been suggested but never proven. Although no trigger has yet been
identified, most MS experts believe that some infectious agent is
involved in initiating the disease process.

**Is it a curable disease?**

As we do not know yet what causes MS, there is no cure. We have
medications which slow the disease progress, and reduce the severity and
duration of relapses.

**Will she be okay?**

This is the biggie, and the one that will probably take you a while to
come to terms with, but it's big:

**YES, SHE WILL BE OKAY.**

She's going to have a few extra little things to deal with, but MS is
not fatal. It causes a bunch of symptoms, and they're pretty annoying,
and you often have to adjust your lifestyle around them, but they won't
kill you. It will be depressing knowing that you have to deal with these
symptoms, and for the most part, no one will be able to tell that you
have this disease (it's what we call a silent or hidden disability). But
you can work around all of the symptoms the disease causes, and along
with taking one of the approved MS therapy drugs, people with MS have
nearly the same lifespans as those without the disease. So yes, she's
going to be okay. And so will you.
