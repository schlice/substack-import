**What happens if an official leaves the office before the end of
his/her impeachment process?**

Ask [[Richard
Nixon](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=61db3c&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon){.external_link

He resigned before he could be impeached and removed from office on
August 9, 1974. His successor, Gerald Ford, pardoned him on September 8,
albeit reluctantly, ending any possibility of indictment over his
involvement with the Watergate affair. Nixon made a public statement
after the pardon, never admitting any wrongdoing, simply saying:

> I was wrong in not acting more decisively and more forthrightly in
> dealing with Watergate, particularly when it reached the stage of
> judicial proceedings and grew from a political scandal into a national
> tragedy. No words can describe the depth of my regret and pain at the
> anguish my mistakes over Watergate have caused the nation and the
> presidency, a nation I so deeply love, and an institution I so greatly
> respect.

So what happens if an official leaves office before they are impeached
and removed? They become an ordinary citizen again.
