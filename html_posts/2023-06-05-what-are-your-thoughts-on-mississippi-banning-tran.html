So in one of those bizarre "well, when you put it ***THAT*** way"
moments, the left once again tries to normalize their abhorrent behavior
by plastering over it with polite words.

They call it "transgender health care." Sounds innocuous enough.

What it ***actually*** involves is surgically removing the healthy
genitalia of minors, which are still required by their still-developing
bodies in order to properly develop. No amount of cross-gender hormone
therapy will restore that normal bodily growth. In just the same way
that we can't combine chemicals in a test tube and create life, we can't
use plastic surgery and hormone injections to make a male into a female.

Until those bodies have fully developed, removing their functioning
genitalia will cause massive health issues down the road. Brittle bone
disease, osteoporosis, and anorgasmia, as well as needing to take
hormone therapy for the rest of their lives (which is known to cause
cancer) is the life they have to look forward to.

And you can, with a straight face, describe this as ***health care?***
In case you have forgotten the very beginning of the Hippocratic Oath,
it begins, "First, do no harm."

Well, when you put it ***THAT*** way...
