**Is there a publicly available database of nucleotide sequences of the
HLA-DRB1 genes of people with multiple sclerosis?**

No.

How can I say this so emphatically?

There never was a study to collect DNA of persons with MS. Even if there
was, there never was a study to collect DNA *AND* separate out
nucleotide sequences. And finally, even if there was, there never was a
study to collect DNA, separate out nucleotide sequences, *AND* make the
results publicly available.

Too many companies need to make money off of that data to make it
publicly available.

You're probably about 50 years too early. And by that point, who knows,
we could have a functional cure.
