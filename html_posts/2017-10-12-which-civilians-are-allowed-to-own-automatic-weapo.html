**Anyone in the United States who is authorized to own a firearm is
Federally authorized to own an automatic weapon. However, states have
many varied restrictions on whether or not state residents may own,
possess, or use, automatic weapons.**

There is a popular misconception that you need all sorts of Federal
Firearms Licenses and certifications, and that civilians can't own them,
but that is simply not true.

Automatic weapons are classified under the National Firearms Act
(colloquially called "NFA weapons"), and there are generally three ways
to own one: as an individual, through a gun trust, or as part of a
Limited Liability Corporation (LLC). For the purpose of this answer,
we'll stick to the individual ownership method.

Legal possession of an NFA weapon requires **transfer** of that weapon
from one legal owner to another. The weapon must be registered with the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE). Private
owners wishing to purchase an NFA item must obtain approval from the
BATFE, pass an extensive background check (which includes a photograph
and fingerprints), ensure the firearm is fully registered, receive BATFE
written permission before moving the firearm across state lines, and pay
a \$200 tax. BATFE will provide you with a "tax stamp" which shows the
tax was paid, and that stamp gets affixed to the approved paperwork.
Additionally, BATFE can inspect your firearm at any time, and the
paperwork approving the firearm must be with it. BATFE mandates safe
storage of automatic weapons, and failing to keep that weapon in its
safe storage can net you big fines and possibly jail time.

Since no new automatic weapons which have been manufactured after May
19, 1986 can be registered to civilians, there is an artificially low
quantity of them, which makes their price artificially high. For
example, a transferrable M-16 (fully automatic) will run anywhere
between \$11,000 and \$18,000, while the same weapon, brand new, sold to
law enforcement or the military, retails for between \$600 and \$1000.

As I mentioned, there are state restrictions on fully automatic weapons,
as well as additional licensing and approval requirements, and these
restrictions are many and varied.

However, the short answer is that anyone who can own a firearm legally
can also own a fully automatic weapon. It's not cheap, but it is doable.
