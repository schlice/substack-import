**If the police stops you for running a red light, but you are 100%
certain the light\'s still yellow when you cross the intersection, but
there\'s no dashcam to prove, what should you do?**

What you do is entirely up to you.

Remember that the officer is not going to argue that you ran a red
light. He's going to argue that you **failed to stop**. This is very
different from running a red light.

The law says that a motorist must make a reasonable attempt to stop when
the light changes. If you did not slow down, attempt to slow down, or if
you *sped up* (which some people do when they see a yellow light), the
officer can cite you for that.

And at that point, and with no other evidence or witnesses, it's your
word against his. And the court will likely side with him.
