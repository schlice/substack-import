**If mobile phones and electronics shouldn\'t be on during flights, why
do airplanes get equipped with wifi on board?**

The problem is not with electronic devices being "on" during flight. The
problem has to do with **cellular radios** being on during flight, and
the reason has nothing to do with technical incompatibilities between
cellular radios and aircraft avionics and automatic flight controls.

When cellular telephones first came out, airlines required them to be
off for the duration of the flight, because they were "transmitting or
receiving devices" and they could potentially interfere with avionics.
There were some anecdotal stories of someone receiving a cell phone call
in-flight and an aircraft avionics cluster experiencing some strange
readings, but there has never been any large-scale testing, as doing so
would require massive amounts of clearance to violate FCC rules, inside
of a flying airplane. No aircraft manufacturer has yet desired to jump
through the regulatory hoops to even test, and the airlines simply found
it easier to disallow their use during flight (incidentally, Mythbusters
tried to test this with an airplane on the ground, but even that testing
was problematic. Ultimately, they didn't find much interference. Maybe
with some older planes, but indeed, most planes are shielded pretty well
against electromagnetic interference). Additionally, what would you
test? Phone hardware changes so frequently, and testing is so slow and
methodical, that by the time your findings were released, the industry
would have moved on to the next phone. Finally, when you use your cell
phone in-flight, you don't stick to just one cell, you bounce from cell
to cell mid-flight. If you allowed thousands of people in flight to use
cell phones, you'd disrupt the cell towers on the ground, not the
airplane. This is why it is the FCC, not the FAA, that makes the rules
regarding cell phone use in flight, and prohibits their use.

When phones moved into the "smartphone" category, people wanted to use
them to listen to music, or play games, or read books, just like any
other portable electronic device. Smartphones have an "Airplane Mode"
specifically designed to disable all of the radios so that the phone can
be used in an offline mode. Phones were then allowed to be activated
after takeoff, so long as they were in the "Airplane Mode" or other
suitably non-transmitting mode.

Finally, with Wi-Fi becoming nearly as ubiquitous as cellular towers,
and airlines wanting to provide more value to (read: make more money
from) their customers, they began partnering with in-flight Wi-Fi
solutions which utilize special in-cabin Wi-Fi antennas. Wi-Fi is a
totally different frequency and uses much lower power transmitters than
cellular radios. Wi-Fi can be used safely, and more importantly to the
airline, a captive Wi-Fi portal can be established inside the aircraft,
and the airline can provide a pay portal to access Internet content.

Next up in the airline's move to modernize: opening ports for Wi-Fi
calling (and charging for the privilege). We will see how well that goes
over. It will only be different from the Airphone days in that the price
won't be nearly as expensive as it used to be. Probably something like
\$5 to \$10 to allow Wi-Fi calling for the entire flight, similar to the
price of allowing Internet access for passengers.
