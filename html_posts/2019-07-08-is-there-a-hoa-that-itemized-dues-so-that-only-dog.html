**Is there a HOA that itemized dues so that only dog owners pay for
costs of operating a dog park and tennis players pay for that of a
tennis court which belong to the association?**

Initially, this request seems innocuous. Even logical.

But let's extend that. Why should I have to pay taxes that go to
schools, when I don't have a child in school? Why should I have to pay
taxes that go to certain state parks when I don't use those parks? The
reason: educated children and open space are important to everyone, even
if you don't personally use them.

The same holds true for tennis courts and dog parks. It is easy to argue
that these things enhance the overall value of your neighborhood. It
makes your neighborhood a more desirable place to live. So even if you
don't personally *use* those services, you *benefit* from those
services, indirectly, by living in a more desirable neighborhood.

Additionally, your buying power is multiplied when everyone shares those
costs. How would you calculate what you had to charge each individual
dog owner? And what if you get a new dog? Would you charge by dog? And
what about when someone moves in/out? And what about if someone only
uses the park occasionally? Would they pay less than someone who uses
the park every day? The administrative logistics of such a plan would be
a nightmare.

To that end, everyone in the association contributes to the amenities in
the association, whether or not you use them.
