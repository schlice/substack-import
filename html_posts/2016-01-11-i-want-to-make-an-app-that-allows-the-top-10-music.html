No one truly downloads songs for free. Someone always pays for the
music.

Unlike what you may have read or heard somewhere, if you\'re downloading
songs for free and no one is paying for the music, you are *stealing.*
Unless the author has released the music royalty-free, someone is
supposed to be paying for that music.

Therefore, for you to make an app that allows people to download songs
for free, you have to work out who pays for the music, because clearly
you don\'t want the consumer to foot the bill. If you are hosting the
music, you must pay royalties every time the song is downloaded. Maybe
you can show them an ad before the download starts. That way, you can
pay the royalties with the ad revenue. Good luck making any money that
way though.

If, however, you are just pointing to songs hosted somewhere else, it is
up to the hosting provider to pay the royalties however they choose to
do so.

If you point to songs you know are illegally hosted, or you know the
provider is not paying royalties to stream the music which is not
released royalty-free, you can face fines as well.
