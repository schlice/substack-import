Well, I guess it's up to me to take the opposite view today.

*(NOTE: Throughout this discussion, I refer to "masturbation," by which
I mean "solo masturbation." To be clear, what you do together with your
spouse, in a loving committed relationship, in the bedroom, is not what
we are discussing, as this is not sinful. When we discuss masturbation
in this context, it is specifically by yourself).*

Masturbation, especially for the reasons we claim to do it, **is
sinful**. Christians don't like to hear that, because it generally
convicts them, and that's uncomfortable for anyone.

I just want you to know that I write this with great love for all of my
Christian brothers and sisters, and believe me, I know your struggle.
But struggle alone does not make something biblical. Anyway, let's
discuss.

Though the Bible nowhere explicitly addresses masturbation, it does
outline the purpose of sex. According to 1 Corinthians 7:2--5:

> Each man should have sexual relations with his own wife, and each
> woman with her own husband. The husband should fulfill his marital
> duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband. The wife does
> not have authority over her own body but yields it to her husband. In
> the same way, the husband does not have authority over his own body
> but yields it to his wife. Do not deprive each other except perhaps by
> mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to
> prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you
> because of your lack of self-control.

Implicit in this passage are these truths:

- God's plan for sex requires relationship, namely, that of a husband
  and wife (verse 2). Masturbation is sex disconnected from
  relationship.
- Foundational to God's plan for sex is giving one's body to another
  (verse 4). Masturbation is the keeping of one's body to oneself.
- The solution to a time of deprivation is to "come together" (verse 5).
  Masturbation is done alone, not together.

So right away, we see that masturbation is not in keeping with God's
plan for us, and the answers for married couples are all right there.
But there are so many who say that it's good to masturbate to equalize
the libidos of two sexual partners. It releases marital tension when one
spouse is more sexually active than another, and therefore builds a
healthier marriage. The biblical description of sex in marriage,
however, doesn't allow for that. It says that the woman yields her body
to her husband; it's her responsibility to take care of his needs, just
as it's his responsibility to address her needs. Remember, God's plan
for sex is that spouses give themselves to each other. Any sexual
activity apart from that goal is, therefore, sinful.

Singles say that it's a *physical need* that they must fulfill or they
can't sleep, their work suffers, etc. However, the Bible never presents
sexual fulfillment as a need. On the contrary, Paul says to the
unmarried, "It's better to stay unmarried" (verse 8). Paul continues in
verse 9, where he identifies the proper outlet for single people who
struggle with sexual desire: "If they cannot control themselves, they
should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion." Paul
suggests that self-control (one of the gifts of the Holy Spirit) is the
best answer. To singles who lack self-control, Paul does not say, "Let
them masturbate;" he says, "Let them marry." Again, marriage is the
God-given outlet for sexual tension, not masturbation.

So, is masturbation a sin? The Bible does not directly answer this
question, but there definitely are some biblical principles to apply:

1.  "So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the
    glory of God" (1 Corinthians 10:31). If we cannot give God glory for
    something, we should not do it.
2.  "Everything that does not come from faith is sin" (Romans 14:23). If
    we are not fully convinced that an activity is honoring to God, it
    is a sin.
3.  "I will not be mastered by anything" (1 Corinthians 6:12).
    Christians have a responsibility to avoid anything that might
    enslave them.
4.  "I discipline my body and keep it under control" (1 Corinthians
    9:27). Self-denial is difficult, but self-discipline is worth it.
5.  "The fruit of the Spirit is . . . self-control" (Galatians
    5:22--23). Masturbation is almost always a sign of a lack of
    self-control.
6.  Do "not gratify the desires of the flesh. For the flesh desires what
    is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the
    flesh. They are in conflict with each other, so that you are not to
    do whatever you want" (Galatians 5:16--17). We are called to
    self-denial, not to self-gratification.

These truths should have an impact on what we do with our bodies. In
light of the above principles, it is doubtful that masturbation can be a
God-honoring activity. If masturbation could be done with

- no lust in the heart
- no immoral thoughts
- no pornography
- no self-gratification of the flesh
- full assurance that it is good and right
- thanks given to God

then perhaps it would be allowable. But those qualifiers seem to negate
the very meaning and purpose of masturbation. They also point directly
to some reasons Christians claim to need masturbation, such as
satisfying a need of the flesh.

So while I commiserate, I cannot condone, Biblically. For these reasons,
I believe masturbation is sinful in the vast majority of cases.

(EDIT) I've now had multiple commenters talk about "sexless marriage"
and "touch deprivation" which cause great concern for believers who feel
"stuck" in their marriage. They are isolated and face tremendous
psychological pressures.

So let's address the other side of the equation: sin in marriage.

Marriage is a sacred covenant, a divine institution established by God.
Traditional wedding vows encapsulate the essence of this commitment:
\"To have and to hold, from this day forward, for better or for worse,
for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to
cherish, until death do us part, in obedience to God's holy command.\"
These vows signify a lifelong dedication to love and honor one another,
reflecting the love of Christ for His church. However, the reality of
marriage is that it involves two imperfect, sinful individuals, which
can lead to significant challenges and, in some cases, the consideration
of divorce.

Marriage unites **two sinners,** each with their own selfish desires and
individualistic tendencies. This union often reveals the stark
differences between spouses, long after the marriage vows have been
sealed, leading to conflicts and misunderstandings. The story of a
couple who, despite their differences, found themselves unknowingly
seeking love online only to discover they were already married to each
other, illustrates how easily couples can become blinded by their own
selfishness.

The question arises: Is divorce biblically justified, and if so, under
what circumstances? Jesus addresses this issue in Luke 16:14-18, where
He confronts the Pharisees\' liberal interpretation of the Law regarding
divorce. The Pharisees, who were lovers of money and self-justification,
had distorted the Law to allow divorce for trivial reasons, such as a
wife burning dinner or speaking too loudly. In Luke 16:18, Jesus states,
\"Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery,
and he who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery.\"
This statement underscores the sanctity of marriage and the seriousness
of divorce. Jesus provides a more detailed explanation in Matthew 19:9,
where He introduces the \"exception clause\": \"And I say to you;
whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries
another, commits adultery.\"

The term \"sexual immorality\" (Greek: porneia) encompasses a broad
range of sexual sins, including adultery, incest, homosexuality, and
prostitution. Jesus clarifies that while divorce is not required in
cases of sexual immorality, it is permitted. This allowance recognizes
the severe breach of trust and defilement of the marriage bed caused by
such actions.

The Apostle Paul expands on Jesus\' teaching in 1 Corinthians 7:10-15.
He emphasizes that marriage is a lifelong commitment and that divorce
should not be pursued without serious consideration. However, Paul
introduces another exception: abandonment by an unbelieving spouse. He
states, \"But if the unbelieving partner separates, let it be so. In
such cases, the brother or sister is not enslaved. God has called you to
peace\" (1 Corinthians 7:15).

So this begs the question: **can one partner in a marriage sin by
emotionally "abandoning" their spouse?** If that partner is unrepentant,
***can this be Biblical grounds for divorce?*** Can refusal to even
touch your spouse be considered grounds for divorce?

There certainly is no requirement to stay in a marriage where the
marriage is actually causing emotional ***harm***. Paul says very
clearly: "the brother or sister is not enslaved. God has called you to
peace." God does not desire your marriage to be a ***prison***. This is
exactly what the Pharisees did: adherence to the Law regardless of the
consequences. Clearly, we are not talking about divorce when a spouse
burns dinner or talks too loud. But does God call it sin when we divorce
an abusive spouse? Certainly not. Paul talks about "abandonment" by an
unbelieving spouse. Can touch deprivation in a marriage be considered
"abandonment?" Abdication of the marriage vow? Lack of commitment to the
marriage, and to God's covenant in it?

The key when considering divorce is not just the sin, but the **lack of
genuine repentance**. Divorce acts as a severe form of discipline, akin
to church discipline, which is enacted due to unrepentant sin. The goal
is always reconciliation and restoration, but when a spouse remains
unrepentant, divorce may become necessary to protect the innocent party.

Marriage is designed to be a lifelong covenant that reflects the love
and commitment of Christ to His church. However, the Bible provides
guidelines for when divorce is permissible, emphasizing the importance
of repentance and the protection of the innocent spouse. As believers,
we are called to uphold the sanctity of marriage, seek reconciliation
where possible, and support those who are suffering in unrepentant and
abusive relationships.

In the end, our commitment to our marriage vows should be unwavering,
striving to honor God in our relationships and demonstrating to the
world the beauty of a Christ-centered marriage.
