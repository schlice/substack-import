**Content:** [Marijuana is still illegal under Federal law.\
\
Where people in Colorado (being one of those Coloradans myself) need to
be especially concerned is our various ski resorts, which are almost
universally located on National park land, not on state land. Therefore,
while legal in Colorado, marijuana is illegal on the slopes. Park
Rangers have been cracking down on marijuana at ski resorts, and have
already made record numbers of arrests for illegal drug use on the
slopes. Note that it is very clearly posted at the base camps and at the
lifts that marijuana is illegal on Federal land.]{.rendered_qtext}
