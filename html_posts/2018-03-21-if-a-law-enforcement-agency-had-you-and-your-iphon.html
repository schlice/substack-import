**If a law enforcement agency had you and your iPhone in custody, could
they hold it up to your face to unlock it without your permission?
Looking for US and Canadian perspectives.**

This could change tomorrow, but currently, the law protects your
**password** from being revealed against your will. It does not protect
your **biometric data** (i.e. fingerprint, iris, etc). Biometric data is
data about who you are, and it is public information. Your password is
something you know, not something you are, and you cannot be compelled
to reveal your passcode against your will. It is considered *testimony*
to reveal a passcode; providing a fingerprint or taking a picture of
your face is not considered testimony. Think about it: when you are
arrested, the police take your fingerprints and your picture, and that
information is entered into a database. It is not protected,
personally-identifiable information under the law.

So can the police hold your phone up to your face to unlock it? Under
current interpretations of the law, yes they can. Can they make you
enter your password to unlock your phone? No, they cannot.

(EDIT) Comments were discussing the legality of doing such a thing, as
there is an expectation of privacy when your phone is locked, even with
a biometric lock. The original question did not ask whether or not the
police had legal basis to view the contents of your phone, so I am
answering the question which was asked: the protected nature of
biometric data, especially when it is used to lock a phone. This is why
biometrics, while convenient, are on legally shaky ground when it comes
to protecting the contents of a mobile device.

Pro tip: ***if you are going to be arrested, power off your phone***. On
both iPhone and Android devices (current models), when you have
biometric locks enabled, a phone restart requires entering your
passcode. Your biometrics are useless when your phone is restarted. On
some Android phones, depending on software and model, you can set a
hotkey or a keypress combination to lock your device to the passcode
(not to the biometric screenlock). Even the "pattern lock" on Android is
more legally protected than your biometric data.
