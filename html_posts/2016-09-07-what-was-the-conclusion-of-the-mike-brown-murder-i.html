The grand jury did not find evidence that Officer Darren Wilson had
committed murder. He was therefore never charged. The department found
his use of force to be justified. The coroner's reports matched Wilson's
testimony.

"Hands up, don't shoot" was completely fabricated by someone who wasn't
even present during the altercation.
