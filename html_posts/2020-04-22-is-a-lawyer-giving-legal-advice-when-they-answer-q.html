**Is a lawyer giving legal advice when they answer questions someone has
about a stranger\'s legal situation?**

There is a difference between *legal advice* and *legal information.*

Only lawyers are qualified to give legal advice. Non-lawyers can give
legal information.

Even if lawyers answer a question, it wouldn't be considered legal
advice unless the answer would affect the rights and responsibilities of
the person who asked the question. Actual legal advice requires research
to determine how the law applies to that specific person, which requires
an attorney-client relationship, which only licensed attorneys in that
jurisdiction can create, and they certainly would not use open forum
spaces to answer those questions. True legal advice comes from
establishing an attorney-client relationship and then working through
that relationship only.

When anyone answers legal questions on forums such as this one, they are
providing legal information, not legal advice.

That's why when I answer questions like these, I always append a footer:

\

*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice. This
answer does not create an attorney-client relationship, nor is it a
solicitation to offer legal advice. This answer is for GENERAL
INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. If you ignore this warning and convey
confidential information in a private message or comment, there is no
duty to keep that information confidential or forego representation
adverse to your interests. Seek the advice of a licensed attorney in the
appropriate jurisdiction before taking any action that may affect your
rights. If you believe you have a claim against someone, consult an
attorney immediately, otherwise there is a risk that the time allotted
to bring your claim may expire.*

*Quora users who provide responses to legal questions are intended
third-party beneficiaries with certain rights under Quora\'s* [[*Terms
of Service*](https://www.quora.com/about/tos)]{.qlink_container}*.*

\

(I can't use the automatic footer because I already have it set for
medical answers, which I also give)

Basically, this footer reminds readers that this is not legal advice,
just legal information. Quora does not allow anyone to give legal
advice, and we want to make it abundantly clear that this is not what
they are getting here.

If you want legal advice, hire a lawyer.
