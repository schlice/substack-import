Oh, so you mean this guy?

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ro\...](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4b170a&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis){.external_link

Even the legacy media is saying that DeSantis champions all of Trump's
priorities without the annoying Trump-esque characteristics. And he does
so intelligently and without the same level of belligerence and
braggadocio. He is a clear front-runner who could pose a real challenge
to Biden.

But he has been taking a lot of hits from the legacy media, presumably
in an attempt to tarnish his image and make him less palatable as a
possible Republican to run against Biden.

So would I vote for DeSantis if there wasn't a better alternative? Sure.
Are there better alternatives? Indeed there are. Here's who I'd love to
see run:

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ni\...](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=47687d&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Haley){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"

qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}

She is a woman, she is of Indian descent, and she became the first
Indian American in a cabinet position, so in theory, she meets all of
the "minority" rules, at least better than DeSantis. She is well-spoken,
super-smart, and tenacious. She has foreign policy experience (being the
US representative to the UN might do that for you). She was also a
governor. I'd vote for her in a hot second (I also would have voted for
Condi Rice if she'd have run, but that's neither here nor there).

But Haley will be panned as a Trumper, since she served on his cabinet.
I have a feeling, though, she'll be able to overcome that stigma fairly
easily.

Original question:

Would you vote for someone with Trump-Esque policy but with the
temperament of Biden (e.g wants a wall but would never refer to Mexicans
as rapists & murderers. Wants tax cuts for the rich but wouldn\'t tweet
at his rivals as scumbags and unAmerican)?
