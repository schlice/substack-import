**According to the US Constitution, if there is a massive national
crisis, can the presidential election be suspended?**

No, because we don't have one Presidential election governed by the
Constitution. We have 51 Presidential elections, all controlled by
entities outside of the Federal government. The Federal government
doesn't control elections, the states do.

And there's no provision in the Constitution for it to govern how the
states elect presidents. There's no provision for a President's term to
be extended because of a crisis. We must hold an election.

It would be up to the state to effect an election during a massive
national crisis.
