**Content:** [I certainly hope so. However, I think there are more
physical effects of LSD than the psychotropic affects in ones visual
cortex.\
\
You would only be experiencing a view of what someone on LSD sees, not
actually experiencing the psychological effects. You also wouldn\'t feel
any of the mood-altering effects of the drug.\
\
So in the short term, VR could provide the non-drug user a glimpse into
what the world looks like for an LSD user, but I doubt it would actually
replace the drug.]{.rendered_qtext}
