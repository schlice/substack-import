The answer, as with all legal answers, is "it depends."

In this case, if your HOA has a rule which disallows all signs
regardless of content, then it's unlikely you'll be able to display a
Biden sign without facing a fine.

What *most* HOAs do is not disallow all signage all the time, but most
HOAs will place *restrictions* on political signs. Normally, political
signs are limited in time period. For example, the HOA may say that you
can only place political signs within 45 days of the election, and the
signs must be removed no later than one week after the election. Many
HOAs also limit the size of political signs. Most political signs are 12
by 18 inches, but some can be as large as 18 by 24 inches. The HOA will
likely set this (18 x 24) as the largest political sign you can post in
your yard. Finally, HOAs can limit the *number* of yard signs you can
post at any time regardless of time of year, and this includes
advertisements for vendors who have just performed work at your
property.
