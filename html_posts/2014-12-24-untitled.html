**Content:** [Are you saying that but for the testimony of Wilson, the
indictment would have been brought?\
\
You can only make the claim that the grand jury was rigged if it was a
slam dunk other than for the exculpatory evidence brought by the
\"defendant\" (as there is no defendant in a grand jury). Since that is
not the case here (forensic evidence was clearly exculpatory), you
can\'t state that the grand jury was rigged. You can state that the
process was flawed or skewed, but you can\'t claim that it was rigged
just because Wilson was called to testify about what
happened.]{.rendered_qtext}
