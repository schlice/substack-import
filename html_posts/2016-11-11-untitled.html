Holly, your best course of action at this point is to retain the
services of a real estate attorney in your area who is experienced with
HOA law.

Specifically on Quora, you have moved into an area we call a "specific
legal question" and while we want to help if we can, once we move out of
the realm of a general legal question and into "I have this issue" sorts
of questions, you're better off talking to someone who knows not only
local real estate law in your area, but the specifics of HOAs where you
live and how your state handles them.

HOAs are treated differently in different states. Some states can work
with HOAs, others attempt to oppose them at every turn. You will be best
served by speaking to a lawyer in your area. Here in Colorado, the
legislature likes HOAs but the courts do not. It's tricky navigating the
legal landscape when dealing with HOAs. Your best bet is to find a good
real estate attorney with HOA law experience.
