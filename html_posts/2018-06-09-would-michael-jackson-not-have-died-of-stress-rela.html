**Would Michael Jackson not have died of stress rated ailments, if he
was never falsely accused for sexul offenses? If so, shouldn\'t his
false accusers be charged with murder?**

1.  You simply cannot know that his death (which was actually caused by
    medication interactions which he was taking due to stress) was due
    to the stress of the lawsuits. He was acquitted in 2005, and he died
    in 2009. The court cases wouldn't even be seen as a proximate event
    to his death, so it's unlikely that they would ever be seen as
    causative.
2.  Murder is a very specific crime which requires the taking of a life,
    with malice, and forethought. It would be a tremendous stretch (and
    one which would require weighty and convincing evidence) to show
    that the sexual offense accusers were acting with the specific goal
    of causing Jackson's death through medical malpractice, which they
    could never know would take place four years in the future.

It's simply an impossibility to believe that the people who accused
Jackson of sexual offenses would have known that he would be subjected
to medical malpractice four years in the future.
