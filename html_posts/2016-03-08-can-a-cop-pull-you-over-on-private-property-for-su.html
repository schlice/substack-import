What\'s more important is that regardless of jurisdiction (some
jurisdictions like Nevada, as [[Tim
Dees](https://www.quora.com/profile/Tim-Dees)]{.qlink_container}
mentioned, exempt private property from DUI enforcement while others,
like Illinois, as [[Christopher
Hawk](https://www.quora.com/profile/Christopher-Hawk)]{.qlink_container}
mentioned, do not), the *hot pursuit rule* applies. If an officer
observes your behavior on a public street, he can then chase you
anywhere to catch you: inside a home, inside a building, onto private
property (even without the owner\'s permission), across state lines,
etc. Some rules do apply depending on jurisdiction, such as when the
officer actually began the pursuit. And there are inter-agency
considerations when traversing agency borders, but in most cases, an
officer can pursue you almost anywhere to stop you.

Note that this law also notably applies to military police; if they
begin a pursuit on a military facility, they can continue that pursuit
off the base/post. Note that they will normally hand off primary control
of the pursuit to a local law enforcement agency once they engage, but
fleeing off the base is no guarantee of freedom from pursuit
