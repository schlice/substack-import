"Cognitive impairment" is an umbrella term which means changes to a wide
variety of high-level brain functions including your ability to learn
and remember information, organize, plan and problem-solve, focus,
maintain and shift attention, understand and use language, accurately
perceive the environment, and perform calculations.

Certain functions including general intellect, long-term (remote)
memory, conversational skill and reading comprehension are not likely to
change due to MS.

For most people with MS, cognitive changes (should they occur) will be
mild and will only affect one or two of these brain functions. For some
people, the cognitive changes will affect more brain functions and will
be more severe.

There aren't really medications to treat cognitive impairment, though
some medications can help with some specific cognitive functions.
Generally, treatment for cognitive impairment is *therapy*, called
**cognitive rehabilitation.** This includes a number of disciplines, but
generally grouped into two categories: *restorative* activities to help
restore lost cognitive function, and *compensatory* activities to "work
around" the lost cognition:

> **Restorative activities** can include learning and memory exercises:
>
> - **Combine modes of learning:** You will be more likely to remember
>   something if you "see it, say it, hear it, write it, do it." It's
>   okay to give yourself extra time.
> - **Repeat & verify:** Repeat what you hear and verify that it is
>   correct to improve your attention and memory.
> - **Spaced rehearsal:** Repeat and practice information at intervals
>   spread out over time to improve your ability to store information.
> - **Build associations:** Use memory aids! For example, to remember
>   the name of someone you just met, associate her/his name with a
>   friend or family member of the same name, or with a place, color or
>   event that sounds like the new name.
>
> **Compensatory activities that help make up for functions that are no
> longer working well may include:**
>
> - **Consolidate and centralize!** Designate one place in your home as
>   the "Grand Central" information center. Include your master
>   calendar, mail, bills, phone messages, to-do lists, keys, wallet,
>   shopping lists and more.
> - **Plan:** Post a calendar large enough to display everyone's
>   appointments, activities and social engagements, and reminders! Keep
>   pens or markers hanging right beside it. Or use a computer program
>   set up with reminders for routine tasks (synchronize it with your
>   mobile devices so you have your appointments with you while on the
>   go).
> - **Record:** Dictate your to-do list, notes or other things to
>   remember on a digital voice recorder (available on many phones).
> - **Remind:** Use checklists, the alarm on your watch or phone, your
>   kitchen timer, and more.
> - **Eliminate or remove yourself from distractions.** Turn off the TV,
>   music and whatever else is "on" when speaking with someone in person
>   or on the phone. Background visual and noise distractions can make
>   learning or remembering more difficult. If you can't eliminate the
>   distraction (for example, people talking at a party) then ask, "Can
>   we talk in a quieter place?"
> - **Take a break.** If you are having difficulty concentrating, take a
>   breath and refresh.
> - **Do one thing at a time.** Avoid switching back and forth from one
>   topic or task to another. Finish or find an appropriate stopping
>   place in what you're working on before you switch to something
>   else.[\[1\]](#Feeip){#cite-Feeip .citation_link}
