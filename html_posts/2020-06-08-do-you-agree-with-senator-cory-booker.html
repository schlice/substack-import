**Do you agree with senator Cory Booker\'s push to eliminate qualified
immunity for police officers?**

I must agree with [[Colin
Riegels](https://www.quora.com/profile/Colin-Riegels)]{.qlink_container}
and say that we should be looking to overhaul qualified immunity before
we eliminate it wholesale.

Even if we do eliminate it, this does not eliminate Constitutional
protections for police officers. They are still protected by the same
Constitution that suspects are, and if they are in fear for their life,
they can still use the same deadly force that any other citizen of the
United States can.

The heavy modification (or removal) of qualified immunity will allow
more civil rights cases to move forward when previously they could have
been essentially cut off at pre-trial (if they even made it that far).
In its current form, it allows for the disregard of officers' bad faith,
it demands exacting requirements to clearly establish the law, and gives
license to courts to grant qualified immunity without ruling on the
underlying constitutional claims. These traits of modern-day qualified
immunity send the message that law enforcement can disregard the law and
not be held accountable.

This is exactly what protesters have been calling for for so many years.

While I would first look at extreme overhaul vs outright elimination, I
agree with Senator Booker that the doctrine of qualified immunity, in
its current form, is completely ineffective, doesn't achieve what it was
originally intended to do, and doesn't save taxpayers any money in
litigation costs either. It also doesn't protect police officers from
being sued or facing personal financial liability, either. In short, it
has failed at its original aim, and it may send the message to law
enforcement that they can violate the law and not be held accountable.
It should be reworked.
