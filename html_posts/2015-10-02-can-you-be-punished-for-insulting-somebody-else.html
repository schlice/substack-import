**Content:** [If your speech incites a riot, you can be charged with
that offense. If you use slanderous speech which causes harm to another
person, you can be charged with that offense.\
\
But if you simply insult someone (\"Hey, you\'re ugly\"), that\'s not
against the law in the United States, as it is protected by the First
Amendment.]{.rendered_qtext}
