**What stops religious leaders such as the Pope from amending the Bible
in the same way the Constitution is amended?**

The fact that the Constitution is a document with a defined amendment
process, and the Bible is a collection of the inspired Word of God which
is not amended.

The Constitution is amended by first drafting and passing an Amendment
through a supermajority of Congress (2/3 approval in both houses). 2/3
of the states can also form a Constitutional Convention to draft new
Amendments, but this has never been done in our nation's history. Once
the Amendment is written, using whichever means are used, it must be
*ratified* by 3/4 of the states. Only then does it become part of the
Constitution.

The Bible has never really been "edited" *per se*. The individual
writings which comprise the books of the Bible had previously been
duplicated many times over the centuries to prevent them from being
corrupted. What *has* happened to the Bible was that it has been
*translated*. ***Many times****.* As of October 2017 the full Bible has
been translated into **670** languages, the New Testament alone into
**1,521** languages and Bible portions or stories into **1,121** other
languages.[\[1\]](#nNrJZ){#cite-nNrJZ .citation_link} The problem with
these translations is that while you'd like to keep a translation as
close to the original Greek or Hebrew as possible, some words don't have
a one-to-one translation in another language. One notable example is the
word *love*. There are *four different words* in Greek to describe
different kinds of love: Eros, Storge, Philia, and Agape. English has
only one. Another good example is found in the Ten Commandments. The
sixth commandment is often translated as "Thou shalt not kill." In
actuality, a better translation would be "Thou shalt not *murder*." How
do we know this? The Bible actually calls for killing in some places.
Justifiable killing is specified in the Bible. Murder, on the other
hand, which is killing without justification, is specifically
disallowed.

Can the Bible be "edited" much like the Constitution can be amended? If
a book was found to be sufficiently apostolic as to be considered part
of the original canon, it might. But the original "canon of the Bible"
has been known to be so for thousands of years. Not likely that it can
be revised now.
