**Content:** [I am a board member of a non-profit organization, so I
speak from experience when I suggest you read carefully the bylaws of
the non-profit as well as their operating rules. You should also look
into what indemnification they offer against lawsuits against the board.
Will they provide you with general indemnification insurance, to include
attorney representation? I would want to know that before I signed on to
that board.]{.rendered_qtext}
