In the United States, the "American Rule" says that each side pays their
own attorney's fees.

As always, there may be exceptions to that rule. These exceptions may
include:

- where state law requires that the losing side pay the attorney's fees
- where a contract specified that the losing side pay the attorney's
  fees.

Judges can also award "equitable remedies" which would require the
losing side to pay attorney's fees if they determine that it would be
unfair to not do so. For example, if the claimant brought a frivolous or
bad faith lawsuit, or if the claimant brought the lawsuit to be
oppressive against the respondent, and the respondent won. In the past,
judges have awarded equitable remedies when attorneys have exercised
extreme misconduct, to send a message to that attorney.

So check your state law and check your Declaration of Covenants. They
may require that the losing side pay attorney's fees.
