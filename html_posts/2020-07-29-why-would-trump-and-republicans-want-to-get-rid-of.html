**Why would Trump and Republicans want to get rid of the 14th amendment
(birthright citizenship) when his party, the Republicans were the ones
that pass it through in the first place? Does that show an ideology
shift?**

As of right now, five people have answered this question and no one has
actually answered the question.

The answer is that Republicans want to clarify birthright citizenship,
not get rid of the 14th Amendment. Why? Because the truth is that **the
14th Amendment was never intended to confer birthright citizenship.**

The people who wrote the 14th Amendment intended it to apply to recently
freed slaves, and used it as part of the way to reverse some of the
injustices of the *Dred Scot* ruling. They never intended it to imply
that anyone born on American soil immediately becomes an American
citizen.

The relevant section of the 14th Amendment:

> All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to
> the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the
> State wherein they reside

The part of that phrase causing controversy is "and subject to the
jurisdiction thereof."

The original authors recognized that citizens of foreign governments
were not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, or at least
in the way that mattered to them. This is evident in the fact that they
presumed the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment was similar to
what we had in the Civil Rights Act of 1866, that it excludes American
Indians who maintain their tribal ties and \"persons born in the United
States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the families of
ambassadors or foreign ministers\". They all agreed that children of
ambassadors were not citizens, but children who were born in the United
States to legal immigrants (even if they were not citizens) were.

However, the same concurrence in opinion does not address the children
of **illegal immigrants.** Indeed, the *Wong Kim Ark* case only
addressed the birth of children to people lawfully present in the United
States. Edward Erler argued that since the *Wong Kim Ark* case dealt
with someone whose parents were in the United States legally, there is
no valid basis under the 14th Amendment for the practice of granting
citizenship to U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants. He writes,
\"Even if the logic is that Wong Kim Ark became a citizen by birth with
the permission of the United States when it admitted his parents to the
country, no such permission has been given to those who enter
illegally."[\[1\]](#ILRnU){#cite-ILRnU .citation_link}

Therefore, the question of whether or not legal citizenship is granted
to children of illegal immigrants has been handled by Immigration
policy. In the near term, it can be overridden with a simple Executive
Order. However, the broader Constitutional question of whether or not
the 14th Amendment conveys birthright citizenship to the children of
illegal immigrants has never been decided.

Indeed, even the [[American Convention on Human
Rights](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=56cc95&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Convention_on_Human_Rights){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} clarifies (emphasis mine)
that "\[e\]very person has the right to the nationality of the state in
whose territory he was born **if he does not have the right to any other
nationality**."

To that end, we should pass an Amendment which clarifies the Citizenship
Clause of the 14th Amendment. A brief, no-preparation draft:

> The 14th Amendment is hereby clarified to define persons "subject to
> the jurisdiction of the United States" as persons who have been
> granted permission to enter the country legally.

From here, we can debate on who among that group gets birthright
citizenship.

But saying that every illegal who sneaks across the border and drops a
kid on US soil creates a new citizen is problematic for many reasons.

**TL;DR: There is no ideology shift. The 14th Amendment means today
exactly the same as it meant when it was written. It's about time we
start applying it that way.**
