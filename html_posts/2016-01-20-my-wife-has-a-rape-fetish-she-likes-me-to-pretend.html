Why have you not discussed this with her? You need to be having this
discussion with her, not with us.

You need to be telling her that you don\'t appreciate the position she
has put you in. It is important to understand the needs and wants of our
partners. But it\'s also important for our partners to understand and
respect our needs and wants.

It appears you two are at an impasse when it comes to this particular
form of role-play. Perhaps she can pick a different fetish, or frame it
in a different way. But one way or another, you two will have to work it
out.

It\'s clear that you know what she likes and dislikes, but it\'s not
clear that she knows what you like and dislike. And it\'s up to you to
continue the dialog.
