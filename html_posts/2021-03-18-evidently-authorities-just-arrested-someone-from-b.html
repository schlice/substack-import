**Evidently, authorities just arrested someone from BLM or Antifa
outside Kamala Harris\' house. Do conservatives agree that this person
should be prosecuted to the fullest extent?**

First of all, he was arrested about a fifth of a mile away from the
traditional home of the Vice President, the US Naval Observatory. VP
Harris is not living there because the residence at USNO is being
renovated. The VP is currently living at Blair House, the guest house
outside the White House.

Second, Paul Murray is not a BLM or Antifa activist. He's just a fed up
Veteran. There are a lot of us out there. He may have some other issues,
and apparently he was not taking all of his prescribed medications.
There is no indication what his medications were treating.

Murray was arrested on various weapons charges.

Now to answer your question: Murray should be prosecuted to the fullest
extent for the weapons charges. Whatever he did unlawfully with his
weapons should indeed be charged. From the sounds of it, he has some NFA
items which were not registered. So he will likely face charged for
possessing those without the required permits and tax stamps. And since
he lives in Texas, how he got the weapons to Washington, D. C. will also
be a question.
