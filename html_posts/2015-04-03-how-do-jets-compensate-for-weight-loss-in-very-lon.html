There are four forces at work on a flying aircraft at any one time: lift
(and its opposite, weight), thrust, and its opposite, drag. Controlled
flight means (among other things) keeping these forces in balance.\
\
Addressing your question, when weight decreases, and all else is equal,
you must decrease lift in order to maintain altitude. This can be done
in a number of ways:\
\

- Change the AOA of the aircraft
- Decrease throttle

\
When an aircraft is on a long-distance flight, based on what we\'ve
discussed, the aircraft will slightly gain lift, and so must compensate.
Under normal circumstances, this would mean throttling back to decrease
lift. However, aircraft are expected to keep up a certain speed to avoid
interaction with other aircraft in the same flight lane. ATC may make an
aircraft speed up to maintain spacing, in which case it will have to
speed up and change AOA to maintain its altitude.\
\
In practice, once the aircraft reaches cruising altitude, it will enable
autopilot to keep it on the same heading and altitude. Since autopilot
controls the yoke, not the throttle, autopilot would adjust the AOA to
maintain altitude. The autopilot works in conjunction with the
autothrottle in speed mode to maintain the aircraft\'s speed.\
\
So to answer the question, in practice, autopilot and autothrottle will
keep the aircraft straight, level, and at speed.
