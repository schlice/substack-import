Become a VAR (Value-Added Reseller, also known as an Authorized Retailer
or Authorized Distributor).

Find out which carrier(s) in your area are in low supply in terms of
storefronts, and sign on with those companies as a VAR, and you can sell
cellular devices as well as repair them.

You can also sign on to the carrier\'s **Prepaid** division, and resell
prepaid phones and airtime cards. For this, you don\'t have to be picky,
you can sign on with multiple carriers to resell prepaid devices.

Then, when your devices you sold need repair, you can bring business
right back to yourself. If you sold the device, you can offer a service
discount for repairs to encourage more repair business.
