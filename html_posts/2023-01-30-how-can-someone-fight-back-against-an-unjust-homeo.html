If the fine you have received is in violation of local ordinances or
laws, feel free to retain an attorney and file suit against the HOA.

But you didn't say "illegal" or "unlawful." You said "unjust." Usually,
when people say this, it's because they simply disagree with what the
HOA believes, and therefore it is unjust.

If you can show proof of selective enforcement (i.e. two homeowners
violating exactly the same rule in exactly the same way, and a fine is
issued to one and not the other), you can absolutely file suit. That's a
dangerous situation for the HOA, because they could potentially lose the
ability to enforce *any* rules.

You should know, however, that usually what the HOA does is perfectly
legal and legally supportable. In the vast majority of cases, the
Governing Documents exist, you have them, they establish the HOA's
authority, and the HOA is acting within its authority. The fact that you
don't like the rules, or you don't agree with the rules, or you think
the rules are unjust, do not usually constitute enough legal authority
to prevail in a lawsuit.

Bottom line, if you think you have a case, contact a local lawyer in
your area who specializes in HOA law.
