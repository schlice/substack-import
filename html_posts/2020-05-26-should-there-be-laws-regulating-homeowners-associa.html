**Should there be laws regulating homeowners associations? If so, what
laws should there be? What should a homeowners association be allowed to
do and not to be allowed to do with regards to the rules they set?**

You asked a question regarding whether or not there should be laws
regulating HOAs and then you quoted a Reddit article which has a list of
complaints about HOAs in general (and probably his own HOA in specific).

So, should there be laws regulating HOAs? Yes, and there already are.
HOAs are 501(c)4 nonprofit corporations, and as such are governed by
corporate law. As you may know, there are many laws dictating how
corporations run, so I don't think a lack of laws is the case. But then
you quote the Reddit article which specifically complains about the
rules that HOAs put in place, so the question isn't whether or not there
should be laws, the real question is **should HOAs be able to control
nearly everything in the areas which they control?**

The answer to that question is yes, and the reason goes back to the very
reason HOAs exist in the first place.

*The purpose of an HOA is to keep home values as high as possible.*

Everything that an HOA does should be reflective of that ultimate goal.
How they do that is by making sure that there are some standards to
which homeowners must adhere in how they maintain the outside of their
house. This can be as detailed or as lax as the HOA decides, but
ultimately whatever they choose must further that goal of keeping home
values as high as possible.

So let's review the Reddit post and see what he doesn't like about HOAs:

> - HOAs shall not restrict native plants you use in your yard nor
>   require lawns
> - HOAs shall not restrict laundry or clothes drying on your premises

These first two points go towards exactly what we were discussing:
maintaining a certain aesthetic of the neighborhood, a look and feel, in
order to keep some uniformity in the look of the neighborhood, which
increases home values. Managing what you plant or what you erect in your
yards directly reflects that goal of maintaining a specific look of the
neighborhood. This squarely falls under HOA purview.

> - HOAs shall not lean/foreclose against your home for fines less than
>   \$1,000

Doing so is just stupid, since filing a foreclosure costs well more than
\$1000 in fees. But to be fair, it's more than just the outstanding HOA
dues. There's interest, as well as attorney's fees, which can cause that
\$1000 in unpaid dues to double or even triple. So usually the
Association's attorney would advise to not foreclose on a lien until
that amount gets much higher. But placing a lien on the home can be done
at any time at much lower cost than actually foreclosing on that lien.
The lien protects the interest of the HOA in ensuring that if any value
is derived from the property (through refinance or sale), the HOA is
paid what they are due.

> - HOA Board Members shall not serve more than 10 year terms in total
>   per HOA
> - HOA Elections/ballots shall be private and in writing and done at
>   least annually

This is something which can be added to the Bylaws of the HOA. It
requires a vote and signatures of all of the homeowners (usually, some
cities and some HOAs require less than 100%), but all procedures for how
the HOA operates are in the Bylaws, and were provided to you when you
bought your house. You agreed to them when you signed all those forms.

> - HOA fees shall not exceed \$100/month in administrative fees, fees
>   must be capped at 2% raises per year

This one is just silly. Capping the amount of dues just means more
special collections and emergency collections when things pop up, which
just increases overall administrative cost. You elect a Board to manage
this stuff; if they can't do it, elect someone else who can. HOAs don't
increase dues unless costs increase and they can't control those costs
in other ways. Perhaps your Board should do a better job at controlling
costs rather than just increasing dues. You should be doing a better job
of looking at the financials and forcing the Board to explain why things
cost so much.

> - All HOA board members are subject to impeachment if at least 2/3rds
>   of HOA members vote them out
> - HOA Members have a right to hold elections if 25% of HOA members
>   petition an election

Again, why did you elect someone if you're not going to allow them to
complete their term? But by all means, if all of the homeowners agree,
add this to your Bylaws. But don't be surprised when a majority of
homeowners change something because the political will to do so has
shifted. Your HOA will be changing based on the makeup of current
residents and will not be able to effectively do its core job because
the rules change so frequently. Also, I've found that HOAs with
stipulations like these tend to have Boards which are nothing more than
a popularity contest rather than a functioning Board. Perhaps you should
simply shorten the term of a Board member (i.e. instead of 3 years, make
them get re-elected every year).

And as far as holding elections goes, much of that is determined by the
HOA Bylaws which govern how the corporation is run. This includes
elections which must be held at specific times. Allowing out-of-cycle
elections is something which may not be legally permissible. The HOA
attorney would have to help sort that out.

> - HOA Members have a right to up to a 3 month grace period for dues
>   due to hardship

This can also easily be added to the Policies and Procedures. But here's
the problem: who gets to define "hardship?" What's a "hardship?" What
happens when the Board grants a hardship reprieve to one person and not
to another? I know what happens: lawsuits. Boards are not going to want
to do this because it opens the Association up to the possibility of
lawsuits. And who pays for the HOA's attorney in defending against those
suits? All of the homeowners.

> - Prospecting HOA members and current HOA members have a right to HOA
>   rules upon request for a reasonable fee (Capped at 10 cents per
>   page), 2% annual raise max for pages.

First of all, if your HOA doesn't post all of your Governing Documents
somewhere online, you need a new HOA. Everyone should have free access
to all of the documents, and if they don't, it's time to get some new
Board members in there.

Fees charged by the HOA Management Agency are contracted. The contracts
are renewed annually. If you don't agree with the fees charged by the
management agency, fire them and get a new one. Or negotiate with the
current one. Again, this is the job of the Board.
