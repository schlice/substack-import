While we don't have the original copies of the New Testament, we do have
*manuscripts*. Think of a manuscript as a photocopy before photocopiers
were invented. Someone literally rewrites a paper, by hand, to make a
copy. Certainly, that process could introduce errors, but you can
determine if those exist by looking at *multiple* manuscripts.
Therefore, the more manuscripts we have, the more sure we can be that we
have the original text.

Here's the cool part: **The New Testament documents have more
manuscripts, earlier manuscripts, and more abundantly supported
manuscripts than the best ten pieces of classical literature**
***combined.***

This chart shows us the number of manuscript copies for the New
Testament as well as other ancient documents, and it shows the timespan
between the original and the earliest surviving copies of that document.
You can see that of all of these early documents, the New Testament has
more and better manuscript support than anything else from that era.

So is it likely that there is mistranslation? No. We have reliable
copies of the originals, so we know what they said.

Modern technology helps us as well. In the age of digitization, we have
all of this stuff online (of course). You can visit

translation along with the original, side-by-side.

Part of what you may be thinking of when you think of "mistranslation"
is actually related to the differences between languages. There is not a
"one-to-one" correlation between languages. For example, Hebrew has
fewer words than English. Therefore, many words in Hebrew have multiple
meanings. It's up to the translator to pick the correct word in English
to express what the original author was trying to say in Hebrew.
Similarly, there are no fewer than six different words for "love" in
Greek (familial love, platonic love, love between dear friends, erotic
love, etc.), but in English, we only have "love."

Therefore, when creating a Bible translation, you can either stick very
closely to the original words, but you may have a hard time
understanding the meaning of what the original author was trying to say,
or you can reproduce what the author was trying to say, and stick less
closely to the original words.

Translations which stick very closely to the words are called "word for
word" translations. They will very closely retain fidelity to the
original words used, but some of the original meaning may be "lost in
translation." To try to account for this, some translations will use a
"thought for thought" method of translating. The translator will read a
sentence and then re-write it in the target language, trying to retain
the original words as often as possible, but will more frequently try to
retain the original thought that a person reading it in the source
language would have understood. Finally, translators may take a
"paraphrase" method of translation, where translators will read an
entire passage and re-state it in the target language, without concern
to the original words, solely trying to "paraphrase" the original idea.
As you move from "word for word" translations towards "paraphrase"
translations, the translations become more easily understandable and
easier to follow along (in fact, some of the paraphrase translations,
like *The Message*, read like a novel), but retain less fidelity to the
original words used.

Here's a handy graph of many of the current translations and where they
fall on that spectrum:
