Not all states require former employers to provide you with reference
letters.

If you don't get one, you are still right to put that experience on your
résumé, but your prospective employer may not be able to validate it.

It is similar for requests for employment verification. Unless state law
requires it, or unless they get a request from a federally-backed
institution (like a bank doing a loan request verifying employment),
employers are not generally under any obligation to verify your
employment. Most employers voluntarily comply with such requests, but
they are not legally obligated to do so outside of some state laws.

You could always prove your employment in other ways:

- provide pay stubs
- provide your W-2s
- provide your tax returns
