We are all sinners. No one is righteous, not one.

All believers have the best intentions. But we fail. We fail because
we're human, and we still have human frailty, and we still live in a
fallen world, in sinful bodies.

Paul talked about this in his letter to the Romans. He struggled with
exactly what you're feeling now:

> what I hate I do. And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that

Verse 20 is really important: " Now if I do what I do not want to do, it
is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it." It's
not me who is doing it, but the sin that lives within me. We're all
sinners. The sin lives within all of us.

Don't beat yourself up over it. Recognize it, repent of it, and ask God
to give you the strength to resist. Over time, it will get easier and
easier to resist. But remember, we will still fail.

Hang in there. God isn't going to give up on you.
