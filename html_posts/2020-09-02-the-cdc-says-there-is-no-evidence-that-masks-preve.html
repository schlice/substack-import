**The CDC says there is no evidence that masks prevent catching
coronavirus, but why does the CDC wear them?**

There is no definitive study that says that cloth face coverings
"prevent catching coronavirus." However, several anecdotal studies cited
by the CDC absolutely show that wearing cloth face coverings reduce the
spread of the virus. One study came from the Journal of the American
Medical Association (JAMA) and shows that adherence to universal masking
policies reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmission within a Boston hospital
system. [\[1\]](#CsSBW){#cite-CsSBW .citation_link}The other one came
from CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), and it shows
that wearing a mask prevented the spread of infection from two hair
stylists to their customers in Missouri. [\[2\]](#NKyor){#cite-NKyor

Therefore, CDC issues **recommendations**, since it has no authority to
order citizens of any state to do anything. The CDC absolutely
recommends wearing face coverings while out in
public.[\[3\]](#vBgyD){#cite-vBgyD .citation_link}
