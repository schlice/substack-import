There is no requirement that the Senate as a body express such a
position. The Senate gave scheduling authority to the Senate Majority
Leader. The Senate Majority Leader "advised" the President that the
matter would not be taken up until after the next election. Considering
that the Senate Majority Leader sets the calendar, and considering that
the Senate has seated that authority with him, wouldn't that be
considered "advice?"
