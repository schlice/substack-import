**How do police officers respond when they see drivers flash their
headlights to warn other drivers that there is a cop ahead? Is it
illegal to do so?**

[[Roger
Curtiss](https://www.quora.com/profile/Roger-Curtiss-1)]{.qlink_container}
has the right answer here.

"Flashing your lights" by **turning them on and off** *may be illegal in
some states* as some states have a statute which requires motorists to
have headlights on continuously during periods of reduced visibility or
darkness. So if you're flashing your lights in this way during a period
of reduced visibility or darkness, you could be cited under that law.

"Flashing your lights" by using the "flash to pass" function where
pulling the turn signal stalk momentarily turns on your high beams is
likely not illegal in most states.

Plus as Roger mentioned, part of the goal of police monitoring speed is
to "encourage" compliance with the speed limit. Drivers warning other
drivers of police activity is no different than using Waze and marking
police locations, or (back in the day) using CB radio and calling out a
"smokey" when you saw one. Any one of these activities accomplishes that
goal, so honest police organizations (who are not trying to make revenue
off of speeding tickets) should acknowledge this.
