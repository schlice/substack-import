In Colorado, POST requirements for ***reserve*** officers (not even
full-time officers) includes approximately 300 hours of training.
Breaking that down, 50 hours is firearms, 40 hours is driving, 40 hours
is arrest control. The rest of the time is all classroom time, reviewing
the individual sections of criminal law that police are required to
understand. Full-time officers have about twice that, but the times for
practical training are all the same. I know it is similar in the UK.

So I\'m not sure where the whole \"police aren\'t trained in law\"
statement comes from.
