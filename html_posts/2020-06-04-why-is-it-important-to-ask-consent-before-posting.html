**Do you need consent to post a picture of someone?**

*(US answer only)*

As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends." And mostly it
depends on where the photographer is, and where the subject is.

In most public places in the US, "if you can see it, you can shoot it
(with your camera)." If the person is in public and so are you, you can
take a picture of that person and do whatever you like with it,
including posting it online.

Regardless of what you do with it, you still cannot intentionally lie
about someone. So if you take a picture of a woman and you post it to
"naziwomen.com" (I don't know if that's a real website, and I'm not
looking it up either), and that photo causes that woman to lose her job,
you can be sued for libel.

You also can't earn any money off of the photo. If you try to sell the
photo, you need consent from every person pictured.

Note that this doesn't eve talk about restrictions about where the
person is physically located (i.e. in a space in which they believe they
have a reasonable expectation of privacy). There are also other
restrictions which are dependent on the location of the subject or the
location of the photographer, so know before you shoot.

But *in general*, if you take a picture of a person, and both you and
the subject are in appropriate public places, you can do anything you
like with that photo, including posting it online. Be sure you know what
you're doing before posting though.
