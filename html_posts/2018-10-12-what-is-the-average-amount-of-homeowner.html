> **How much are HOA fees?**
>
> For a typical single-family home, HOA fees can cost homeowners around
> \$200 to \$300 per month, although they will be lower or much higher
> depending on the size of your unit and the amenities.
>
> To give you an idea of the range of HOA fees, a 1,000-square-foot
> condo in Des Moines, IA, with no pool, spa, community room, or gym in
> the community has an HOA fee of \$100 per month, which covers
> utilities, landscaping, and snow removal.
>
> On the other end of the spectrum, there's Hollywood's fancy Sierra
> Towers condo building, which is filled to the brim with amenities like
> 24-hour concierge service and valet parking. They charge residents of
> a 3,400-square-foot condo about \$4,000 per month in HOA fees.
> Suddenly that \$250 monthly fee you're considering feels a bit more
> reasonable, doesn't it?
