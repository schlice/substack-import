Silly question by the silly Quora Prompt Generator. Silly silliness.

*Nixon v. US* ruled that the courts have no jurisdiction over the
impeachment process, primarily because impeachments are a *political*
process, not a *legal* process.

I can understand why the confusion sometimes happens. When a President
is tried in the Senate, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court presides
over the trial. And it does give the appearance of being very
*legal-esque,* what with a prosecutor and a defense, and the
Constitution calling it a *trial*. But make no mistake, impeachment is
nothing more than a political process to remove an elected official from
office.

And while impeachment is reserved for "high crimes and misdemeanors,"
which certainly reads like the accused violated laws (and up until
Trump's impeachment in his first term, it was), the accused does not
need to actually violate a law in order to be impeached. Just ask Trump.
In fact, it was another former president, Gerald R. Ford, nearly a half
century ago, while he was still in the House during his 1970 attempt to
impeach U.S. Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, who said "\[a\]n
impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of
Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history." Ford
later became vice president and then president after President Richard
Nixon resigned rather than face impeachment himself.

So given that there is no clear delineation of what is impeachable and
what is not, it becomes clear that the impeachment process is entirely
political, and not judicial. Therefore, the courts have no jurisdiction
over the impeachment process.
