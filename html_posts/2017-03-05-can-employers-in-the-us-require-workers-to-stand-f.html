If it was well known at the time of hiring that all employees must stand
during the National Anthem, refusing to do so, for whatever reason,
could be seen as violating the terms of employment, and be grounds for
termination.

It could be argued, however, that not standing for the National Anthem
is a protected form of free speech, also called *free expression.* That
may be true, but while you are an employee, on company time, being paid
for your work, not following company standards clearly enumerated during
the hiring process does not sound like the appropriate time to exercise
your rights, especially when that action is contrary to business
standards.

The employer would have more of a leg to stand on (no pun intended) if
standing for the Anthem was either part of the corporate culture, or
part of the requirements of doing whatever job you do (for example,
maybe you work at a baseball stadium, and everyone has always stood for
the Anthem, and it\'s clearly written in the employee manual that you
will stand for the Anthem), but simply enumerating it as part of the
requirements of the job should be enough.

**TL;DR: if it is in the employee manual, clearly identified during
hiring, or part of the job, AND it is not illegal for an employer to
make you do it, employers can make whatever standards of conduct they
choose for their businesses, and can fire you if you fail to follow
those standards.**
