I disagree with that statement.

The National Guard was already present and was performing other duties.
When it became clear that a riot had broken out, the Guard members
present were re-tasked, and other Guard members were activated.

Looks like a successful mission to me, and it looks like the Federal
government provided DC the support that they needed.

So to me, it looks like your statement is incorrect.

Original question:

Former President Trump watched but did nothing on January 6th. Is that
dereliction of duty and isn\'t that a crime? If we are a nation of laws,
do we have to follow the law and prosecute him?
