I'm going to repeat what others have said, and add a little more.

- Get the best grades you can get. Work hard at school. If you can take
  AP or college-level classes, do that. It shows your ability to handle
  the academic rigor of college.
- Get into an ACT or SAT prep class. I know it's a little early to be
  thinking about those classes, but they help. Anything to help boost
  your test score is helpful, and those prep classes do help.
- Make sure you are participating in team-level sports at your high
  school. If you're not, start. About 95% of applicants who were
  accepted into the Academy have participated in team sports. About 80%
  of those had earned varsity letters in their sport. Those numbers tell
  you that team sports are very important in the selection process.
- Make sure you are participating in volunteer activities outside of
  your school. Volunteering with your church or in your community is
  another important aspect of your portfolio.
- Use the [[Air Force Academy
  Admissions](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=60e33c&url=https://www.academyadmissions.com/){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
  qt-tooltip="academyadmissions.com"}]{.qlink_container} website. Get to
  know that site. Read all sections of the site, even if you don't think
  they pertain to you. Use the Admissions Tracker on the site to track
  the things you need to do. Use the Admissions Liaison Officer (ALO)
  Locator to find your ALO and reach out to him/her. It's never too
  early to start that conversation.
- Research commissioning sources. Your local Congressman is usually the
  place to go with the best chance of success. Research what your
  Congressman requires for a commission. You can discuss that with your
  ALO as well.
- Ask questions! If something is unclear, ask about it before it becomes
  an issue.

Good luck!
