**John 6:45 says, "It is written in the Prophets: \'They will all be
taught by God.\' Everyone who has heard the Father and learned from him
comes to me." Jesus declares the Father as God who also taught him (Jn
15:15). How can Jesus be that same God?**

Jesus says even more than that, which tells us that He is actually both
God and Man at the same time.

The Bible is clear that Jesus was fully human as well as fully divine.
John 1:1 says that "the word was with God, and the word was God." Then
in verse 14, it says "The word became flesh and dwelt among us as a
man." This is the first place we see the "hypostatic union," where we
find that Jesus is both fully human and fully divine. He is not half-man
and half-God. There are many Biblical references that illustrate that
Jesus was both fully human and fully God. He possessed all of the
attributes of the divine, and all of the attributes of a man, at the
same time.

There is a second teaching in the church called the *communicatio
idiomatum*, which teaches that the attributes of each one of Jesus'
existence do not influence the other. So the fact that He is fully God
does not give His human form special powers, and the fact that He is
fully human does not diminish His divinity in any way. But the
attributes of both are ascribed to the single person of Jesus. In other
words, nothing in the divine was communicated to the human, and nothing
in the human was communicated to the divine. Examples of this can be
found again in John 17:5 - "And now, Father, glorify me in your presence
with the glory I had with you before the world began" as well as John
3:13 - "No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from
heaven---the Son of Man."

The hypostatic union and the dual nature of Christ is one of the
foundational teachings of Christianity, along with another
difficult-to-wrap-our-human-brains-around foundational teaching: the
Trinity (one God, three persons).
