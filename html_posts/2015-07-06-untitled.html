**Content:** [Sadly, it *is* just you. Because so many people conflate
\"increaing police budgets\" with \"militarizing the police\" that we
can\'t get any further funding for police. Costs go up, funding remains
flat. So we do the only thing we can: cut services. Increase the sectors
the fewer officers we have left have to patrol. In our county, we have
sectors where over 5,000 homes are served by TWO deputies. People are
unhappy with response times. Yet they continually vote against
increasing the police budget. Instead, they fund city park tennis court
renovations. Hey, I\'m all for pretty tennis courts. But at the expense
of an extra patrol officer?]{.rendered_qtext}
