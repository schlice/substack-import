**Content:** [I am not assuming this; if anyone would be assuming this,
it would be the state, since they are the ones that make the rules
regarding to whom they will issue marriage licenses, and to whom
benefits will be assigned.\
\
I am fully aware that most gays raise beautiful, healthy families. Some
do not. This is exactly the same case as straights. The state seems to
believe, through whatever evidence they have at their disposal, that the
**best** (not **only**) chance for a child to be successful is to be
raised by his biological mom and dad in a common home. So they
incentivize that relationship by offering state-sponsored benefits tied
to a moniker: *married.* Problem is, other organizations have latched on
to that moniker and also tie their own benefits to that same moniker,
not realizing that those benefits are not the subject of the state\'s
social engineering project and shouldn\'t be assigned based on that
particular moniker. It will be a long and slow process to
reverse-engineer the structure that has built up around the assignment
of benefits based on a state-supplied title, but the prevailing theme in
this country, and in others, is that it is happening, and will continue
to happen.]{.rendered_qtext}
