Remember that the trial phase is to determine if the defendant did what
he was accused of doing. That\'s it. Did the prosecutor prove, beyond a
reasonable doubt, that a crime had been committed. That\'s what the jury
determines.

Your personal opinion as to whether or not this should actually be a
crime, or if you were the DA whether or not you would have pursued
charges, is all irrelevant. If you can\'t decide the case on its merits,
without second guessing the intent of the law or it\'s application, be
sure to tell the judge before the trial starts so you can be sent home.

Where leniency is warranted is in sentencing. That\'s where we say
things like it didn\'t create a nuisance, his work was as good or better
than the city, etc. That\'s where he is able to walk away with a slap on
the wrist.

I hope you can see the difference.
