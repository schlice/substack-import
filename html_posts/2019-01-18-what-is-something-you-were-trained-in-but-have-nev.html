**What is something you were trained in but have never had to use?**

- CBR gear.

CBR stands for "chemical, biological, and radiological." The "gear" is
heavy, full-body suits with embedded activated charcoal to absorb any
nasty airborne chemicals before they touched your skin, and "gas masks"
which can filter out any of that nasty stuff. I used to train others on
how to use it. Never had the opportunity to ever use it.

- CPR

I know all of it. I know how to use the AED (Automated External
Defibrillator). I know how to do the old way (pumps and breaths) and how
to do "Hands-Only CPR." I have an app on my phone that provides me with
a timer and a tempo marker. Never once had to do CPR on someone.
