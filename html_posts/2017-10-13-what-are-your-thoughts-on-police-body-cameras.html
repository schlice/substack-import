I am all for them. 100%. Body Worn Cameras (BWCs) are the next big wave
in policing.

So long as they are implemented properly. And that, I'm sure, will be
the sticking point. Some of the issues we will face when implementing
these devices:

- Activation: Officers should be allowed the flexibility to start and
  stop recording. I know, the conspiracy theorists will claim that this
  will allow police to "selectively" fail to record abuses, but this
  ability to start and stop recordings will not only save money, but it
  will allow officers to maintain privacy in sensitive situations (i.e.
  interviewing a domestic violence or rape victim or a child crime
  victim), or situations when the officer is allowed to have privacy
  (i.e. in the bathroom). Department policy would dictate that all
  official contacts with the public be recorded except for the
  aforementioned sensitive situations. Failure to do so could be grounds
  for termination. Budgetary restraints would likely not make continuous
  recording feasible.
- Storage space: The biggest obstacle to implementing BWCs is storage
  space. I know, my full time job is with Dell EMC, one of the biggest
  storage vendors on the planet. The amount of data that these cameras
  will be generating will be immense, and the amount of space required
  to store all of that video data will also depend on how long
  departments are required to keep the video. We're talking about
  "non-evidentiary video" that is not actively being used in an
  investigation; evidentiary video will be kept until it is archived at
  the conclusion of proceedings. So for non-evidentiary video, do we
  keep it for three months? Six months? The longer the data must be
  retained, the more space will be consumed overall. Storage policy will
  dictate how much storage space we will need.
- More IT guys: Back to point 1, if you do not give officers the
  flexibility to stop the cameras from recording, you guarantee that
  each officer will produce 8 full hours of video which all must be
  maintained, since you don't have definite start/stop times to
  distinguish the videos. You have to keep the entire 8-hour video and
  presume it is all evidentiary, and if evidence is required, someone
  will have to parse through that (mostly useless) video. This will
  require more IT personnel to handle the data. This will require more
  storage space. And ultimately, this will require a bigger budget for
  the police department.
- Privacy: Since non-evidentiary video is government information not
  protected during an investigation, it can be released to the public.
  The default method is through a FOIA request, but there could be other
  methods. I'm not sure that John Q. Public is going to want his drunken
  tirade with police to end up on YouTube, or it could basically ruin
  his life. So there are privacy concerns with releasing BWC video to
  the public, and those concerns will have to be addressed before the
  system goes live

So how many cameras, how much recording can be done, how long it can be
maintained, the policies surrounding the video, and how it is to be
managed, are all dependent on the one long pole in the tent: budget.

If people want BWCs, people will have to increase police department
budgets, or they will not be happy with the results. If people want
police to continuously record, they will have to *seriously* increase
police department budgets before they can even *consider* whether or not
continuous recording is even feasible.
