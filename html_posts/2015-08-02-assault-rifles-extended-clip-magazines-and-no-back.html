**Content:** [Assault rifles is a nebulous term. If you mean the
traditional definition of assault rifles, which means automatic weapons,
those are most definitely illegal.\
\
Extended magazines are illegal in most states.\
\
All gun sales from gun shows or gun Stores require background checks.
Only private party sales don\'t require background checks in most
states.\
\
So you\'re mostly wrong.]{.rendered_qtext}
