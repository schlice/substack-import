**Can I be personally sued for a non-ADA compliant website?**

As with any legal question, the answer is "it depends." Of course,
anyone can sue anyone for anything. The question, as always, is not
whether or not you can be sued, but whether or not the complainant has a
chance of collecting.

Currently, the law is a little bit murky when it comes to ADA compliance
on a website. Courts have been interpreting ADA in various ways when it
comes to website compliance. Some courts have stated that any US
business must have an ADA-compliant website. Some courts have said that
the website must have a "nexus" to a physical location which must be ADA
compliant. This is why Facebook was able to dismiss a 2011 ADA case in
California, but Home Depot was not. Finally, some courts have stated
that ADA simply does not apply to websites.

While the law is still all over the map right now, it's worth noting
that in a personal ADA lawsuit, the only remedies available are
injunctions which force you to bring the website into ADA compliance,
and attorney's fees. If it becomes a Federal case and the DOJ becomes
involved, they may invoke other civil penalties and/or fines.
