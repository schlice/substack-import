**Sean Hannity says both \"I never retained him in the traditional sense
as retaining a lawyer\" and \"I assume that those conversations were
attorney-client confidential.\" Is he confused about what \"client\"
means?**

Actually, I think it is you who is confused.

Attorney-client privilege is a rule that protects confidential
communications between a lawyer and a client. According to
[[Nolo.com](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e77f99&url=https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/attorney-client-privilege.html){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="nolo.com"}]{.qlink_container}, the attorney-client privilege
applies when:

- an actual or potential client communicates with a lawyer regarding
  legal advice
- the lawyer is acting in a professional capacity (rather than, for
  example, as a friend), and
- the client intended the communications to be private and acted
  accordingly.[\[1\]](#EyKSs){#cite-EyKSs .citation_link}

So the "attorney-client privilege" Hannity is speaking of has to do with
the fact that he spoke to Cohen not as a friend, but in asking him legal
advice. Hannity has stated that he never retained Cohen as an attorney,
and that he has never received an invoice from Cohen for services.
According to the definition of attorney-client privilege, retaining the
services of an attorney is clearly not required before attorney-client
privilege may attach to conversations. Note that the privilege can
attach when a "potential client" communicates with a lawyer regarding
legal advice. If the attorney records details about that conversation,
they are indeed protected by attorney-client privilege.
