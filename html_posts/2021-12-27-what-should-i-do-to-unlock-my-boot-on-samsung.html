It all depends on the model of your device. There are different
unlocking methods employed on each device. Some devices don't need to be
unlocked at all. It all depends on the model of the device you wish to
unlock.

Also note that unlocking and modifying your bootloader will cause your
eFuse to trip. **ONCE THIS TRIPS, IT CAN NOT BE RESET.** This means that
certain Samsung features (like Knox) **will never work again on that
device**. Knox is used to secure the encrypted vault on the device, so
features like Samsung Pay and Secure Folders will no longer function.
However, if you're unlocking the bootloader, chances are you are going
to replace the software with non-Samsung software (which is fine), just
be aware of the eFuse before you make that permanent.

(EDIT) While I was conversing with [[Vickers
Carter](https://www.quora.com/profile/Vickers-Carter)]{.qlink_container}
in the comments, I also realized that I failed to mention that doing
this and tripping your eFuse voids your factory warranty. So if you are
still within the window of your factory warranty, and you want to still
be able to make a warranty claim with Samsung, don't do this.
