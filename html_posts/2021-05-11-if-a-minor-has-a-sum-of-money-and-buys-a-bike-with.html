**If a minor has a sum of money and buys a bike without her mother\'s
consent and the mother cancels the contract between the minor and the
bike shop, what are the available remedies at her disposal?**

If it were actually a "contract," the contract would be invalid as a
minor does not have the authority to enter into a contract. There is no
legal liability if the bike shop hasn't fulfilled the contract yet, as
the contract is invalid from the beginning.

However, in most cases, such a transaction would be a "purchase," not a
"contract." In such a case, the "purchase contract" is complete at the
time of purchase. If a minor has a sum of money and buys a bike, the
contract is complete at the point of sale. If the mother doesn't want
the minor to own the bike, she can simply return it to the seller. If
the seller argues against the refund (i.e. all sales are final), the
mother can argue that the purchaser was a minor and did not have
authorization to buy a bike. Of course, the seller could argue that
money from a minor spends in exactly the same way that money from an
adult spends, but that's a bad look during a lawsuit.
