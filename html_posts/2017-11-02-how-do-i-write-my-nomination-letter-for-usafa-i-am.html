Thanks for the question

From the Academy Admissions website:

> In order to be considered for admission to the United States Air Force
> Academy you must be nominated by your country. Nominations from your
> government are processed through the United States Defense Attaché
> Office/American Embassy serving your country. Nominations must be
> received by the Air Force Academy by 14 December for the class
> entering the following June.
>
> To apply for a nomination, write your country's government. Your
> letter should contain complete details about your background and your
> potential for success at the Academy. It should be received at least
> one year prior to the date of admission. The Defense Attaché Office at
> the American Embassy can direct you to the correct ministry in your
> country. DO NOT apply directly to the Air Force Academy or other
> United States government officials.

I would just write the letter. Add bullets if you like. For complete
information regarding international students, check out the

The Academy is allowed to host 60 international students (i.e. non-US
citizens), and generally admit 15 international students per year.
