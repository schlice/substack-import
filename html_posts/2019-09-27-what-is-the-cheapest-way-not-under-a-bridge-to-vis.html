**What is the cheapest way (not under a bridge) to visit Colorado
Springs for a month?**

Your best bet will probably be VRBO or AirBnB. You're not going to get
better rates than that.

If you're up for it, you can camp in any national park and there are a
lot of them in Colorado. You can stay in any one location for up to 14
days, so if you move your campsite once during your stay, you can
essentially stay in Colorado for pretty much nothing.
