Annika, don\'t you think this is a bit disingenuous?

You do know that police don\'t wear battle rattle *routinely*, correct?
During *normal* operations, police wear their blue and shiny.

During *contingencies*, they wear callout gear (i.e. military surplus).

Any department not operating in this mode is causing issues. No
department that I know of *routinely* rolls around in helmets, riot
gear, and rifles.

The difference is between *routine* and *contingency* operations.
