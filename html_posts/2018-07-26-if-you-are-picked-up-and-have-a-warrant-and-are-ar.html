**If you are picked up and have a warrant and are arrested and put in
the police car is it legal for the cops to take you to another person\'s
residence to arrest them also?**

While it is unsafe and generally a bad idea, it's not technically
illegal. If the police have a manning shortage and can't task another
car to pick someone else up, they may do this, but it would be
surprising and highly unusual to do so.
