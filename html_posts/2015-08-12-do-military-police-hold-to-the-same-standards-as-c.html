**Content:** [The philosophy of the two organizations are similar, but
beyond the general idea that they both are law enforcement, they are
very different. While civilian police are accountable to the general
public and to the municipality for which they work, military police are
not accountable to the general public, nor are they similarly
accountable to the military members they protect. They are only
accountable to the chain of command in which they are stationed. This is
important, as they could be dealing with people who outrank them, and
thus need to be outside of that person\'s chain of command in order to
be effective at their jobs. Military police do not \"arrest\" military
members. They \"detain\" military members and release them to their own
chain of command (unit commander or first sergeant) for disciplinary
action.\
\
Military police, as [[Marc
Whinery](https://www.quora.com/profile/Marc-Whinery)]{.qlink_container}
mentioned, enforce the standards in the Uniform Code of Military Justice
(UCMJ), which is the set of laws that the military is subject to, over
and above Federal, state, and local laws. Military police can also
detain civilians who are violating civilian laws on a military base, but
in that instance they would turn them over to civilian law enforcement
for processing. Military installations reside in a state, a county, or a
city, and have *concurrent jurisdiction* with their local counterparts
in civilian law enforcement. This means that while the UCMJ is the law
of the land on a military base, Federal, state, and local laws all still
apply. The military police cannot enforce civilian laws under the Posse
Comitatus Act, but they can detain civilians to be processed by civilian
law enforcement.\
\
On most modern military installations, military police are divided into
two sections: Law Enforcement (LE) and Security Police (SP). Law
Enforcement does the job typically associated with civilian police:
patrol, community relations, and responding to calls for service on the
military base. Security Police performs the Force Protection mission of
military police: they guard the resources and personnel at that
facility. That function may include Alarm Response Teams (ART) for the
alarm-protected interiors of the facilities which house sensitive
materials and operations, and Security Response Teams (SRT) which
respond to radio-dispatched service calls outside of those facilities.
Some smaller installations which are mission-only facilities (i.e. no
housing, no community center, etc) may only have SP functions, with
whatever LE functions are needed covered by SP. Cheyenne Mountain Air
Force Base is one of these facilities. There is no separate LE and SP
functions, they are SP-only, and whatever calls for service are received
are handled by the ART or SRT teams.\
\
As you can see, as far as function goes, military police have a very
different job than civilian police. But as a subset of society, military
police deal with far fewer traditional policing incidents than their
civilian counterparts.\
\
So besides having \"police\" in the name, military police and civilian
police are apples and oranges as far as mission is
concerned.]{.rendered_qtext}
