**Did Trump accomplish anything by stalling the signing of the stimulus
bill? Was it all just high drama, or are there consequences?**

Actually, he pressured Congress to move forward with, and vote, Monday
on an add-on bill which will increase relief payments from \$600 to
\$2000, will begin Congressional investigations into election fraud, and
will repeal Section 230 protections for big tech.

Since he couldn't get Congress to change the initial bill, he at least
pressured them to vote on an add-on bill.
