So I'm going to take the "Creedal Christians" terminology to mean any
Christian who is united by the Creeds: the Nicene Creed and the
Apostle's Creed.

And if I'm understanding your question, another way to say it is *how do
we reconcile the fact that we're not going to be married after death
even though we want those marriages to continue after death?*

We reconcile it the same way we reconcile any difference between what
*we want* versus what the *Bible says*.

> At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in
> marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven --- Matthew 22:30 ESV

It may also help our reconciliation to understand what the Bible tells
us is the purpose of marriage on earth. God instituted marriage so that
we can procreate, and that we should not be lonely. Remember that God
created Eve to be Adam's helper, and to ensure *that he would not be
lonely*.

> The LORD God said, 'It is not good for the man to be alone. I will
> make a helper suitable for him" --- Genesis 2:18 ESV

In Heaven, though, things will be different.

Heaven is not populated by procreation. The people who go there go
because of faith in Christ, not because they were born there. Also,
there is no loneliness in Heaven, and no need for helpers. We will be
surrounded by believers and angels, so the need for a helper and a
companion will not exist in Heaven.

That doesn't mean that we won't recognize our spouses in Heaven, or that
we won't have a close relationship with them in Heaven. It simply means
that we won't be married in Heaven *because there is no need for
marriage in Heaven.*

No other doctrine or understanding is necessary, because no other
doctrine is needed. If we "feel like" we need to be married in Heaven,
we need to get better acquainted with things not necessarily lining up
with how we "feel."

If you've watched the series *The Chosen*, you'll understand what I'm
about to say. If you haven't, it's a great way to spend your online
screen time and grow your faith. In the show, at the point where Jesus
tells Matthew (the tax collector) to follow Him, Simon (not yet Peter)
protests, and says that Jesus calling Matthew is "different" from when
Jesus called him.

Jesus very simply tells Simon, "**get used to different**."

With regard to this topic, I tell you the same: **get used to
different.**
