Lots of great answers here but many are missing the mark.

While many people have discussed the fact that, in most cases, your
employer has the right to view your camera at any time, **doing so is
legally perilous for them.**

Why?

Because *it's a laptop and it doesn't stay in the office*.

It's like the old adage: **just because you** ***can*** **doesn't mean
you** ***should*.**

What, precisely, would they hope to see by turning on your camera?

The whole purpose of being able to monitor the use of their equipment is
to ensure that it is being used in accordance with the reasons you have
it. In other words, monitoring work equipment is to ensure that it is
being used for work. It's far more beneficial to monitor your network
traffic than to view your webcam if that is their true goal.

Anyway, viewing a webcam is perilous for several reasons:

1.  Viewing a webcam is a really poor way to accomplish their goal
    (monitoring the equipment to ensure it is being used for company use
    only). You can't see how the PC is being used; you can only see the
    person using it.
2.  Being a laptop, it is far more likely that the camera will view
    things and locations which are *legally protected* (i.e. the camera
    may see people, places, or activities which are wholly unrelated to
    the purpose of the monitoring), unless there is a business policy
    which dictates when and where the laptop can be used. But even so,
    the camera is far more likely to capture something that it is not
    supposed to capture than to capture something useful to IT.

So to answer the question, if you feel that your employer may be turning
on the webcam on your laptop without your knowledge, put a piece of tape
over the camera. Simple, cheap fix. You can also stick on one of these
privacy shutters to make the solution less kludge-y and more permanent:

*(not a sponsored product, just happened to be the first link that came
up in a search of web camera cover for laptop cameras)*

Using one of these covers allows you to use the camera when you need it,
and then block it when you don't.

In fact, most modern laptops have these manual privacy shutters built-in
to the housing of the camera.

If your employer balks at the cover, you'll know that they want to view
the camera any time you are using the system. Legally, it's their gear,
and they can probably make the case for turning on the camera to monitor
the gear, so you'll have to be hyper-vigilant when you use the laptop,
and just know they are watching you any time the lid is open, and be
prepared for that.
