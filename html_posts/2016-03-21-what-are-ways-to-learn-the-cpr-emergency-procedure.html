The reason why you need to learn CPR in person, as [[Matthew
Higgins](https://www.quora.com/profile/Matthew-Higgins-25)]{.qlink_container}
stated, is because of one simple thing: **doing chest compressions is a
lot harder than it looks.**

Doing some Internet-based training \"in a pinch\" may do more harm than
good. I\'d really discourage you from doing that.

Chest compressions are difficult. You have to displace (move) the
breastbone much farther than you realize. It has to move several inches.
And if you place your hands incorrectly, you can injure the patient more
than they will be injured by chest compressions.

Chest compressions, if done correctly, will break ribs. But to be
honest, I\'d rather have a few broken ribs and be alive than have an
intact ribcage in my coffin.

It\'s a lot harder to do than you think. Most people do it wrong the
first time. Make sure that the first time you do it is not on a person.
Most people who have taken CPR and First Aid training have used a
\"Resusci-Annie.\" This human analog is nothing more than a human torso
designed to respond similar to a human chest when performing
compressions. The more advanced units will indicate when the compression
is effective, and the trainer will tell you on each compression whether
or not you\'re doing it right. It\'s the most effective way to learn
CPR. You must learn it by feel, not by video.

Contact your local Red Cross chapter to see when you can take their next
CPR/First Aid class.

If you don\'t have a Red Cross chapter nearby, contact your local fire
department.
