No one is individually responsible for protecting you but you.

The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment forbids the
government to deprive individuals of life, liberty, or property without
\"due process of law.\"

There have not been cases which "absolve the police of responsibility,"
but instead there have been cases that show that the Constitution does
not require the state to protect any individuals specifically. In 1989
the U.S. Supreme Court in *DeShaney v. Winnebago County Department of
Social Services (489 U.S. 189)* stated, \"Nothing in the language of the
Due Process Clause itself requires the State to protect the life,
liberty, and property of its citizens against invasion by private
actors.\" Generally, the Due Process Clause does not provide an
affirmative right to government aid, \"even where such aid may be
necessary to secure life, liberty, or property interests of which the
government itself may not deprive the individual.\"

There are some exceptions, especially where a special relationship
exists prior to the act, or where a "state-created danger" exists (i.e.
law enforcement left a person in a situation that was more dangerous
than the one they found him in).
