Who exactly are you "protecting" from the unvaccinated person?

- The vaccinated person has nothing to worry about; they won't get
  COVID, and if they do get it (or the Delta variant, or whatever
  variant) it will be mild.
- The unvaccinated person doesn't care one way or the other, and they
  have the right to make their own healthcare decisions.

Original question:

Should the unvaccinated have a "U" tattooed on their forehead so as to
alert and protect the general public?
