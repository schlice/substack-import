No, there is no Federal requirement for homes in the US to have
automatic lawn sprinklers.

While states have many and varied laws regarding the *use* of in-ground
or above-ground automatic sprinkler systems (such as required additional
equipment and usage specifications), there are no requirements to
actually have them in any state law. Most homes (especially new
construction) have them pre-installed by the builder, especially if the
builder is building out the entire neighborhood (as in the case of a
master planned community).
