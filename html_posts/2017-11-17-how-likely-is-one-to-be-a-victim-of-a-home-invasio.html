**How likely is one to be a victim of a home invasion?**

Crimes against property are on the rise in my neck of the woods. People
are getting more desperate, as drugs have become more plentiful and jobs
have not. We've had two smash-and-grabs in my neighborhood, both in
broad daylight. Thankfully no one was home in those houses, but I work
from home...

Statistics say that people are unlikely to be involved in a home
invasion crime. If you choose to put your faith in statistics, you can
feel secure knowing that it's unlikely that someone would target your
house.

But I ask you: if you have a newer (\< 20 years old) house, how likely
is it that you'll be the victim of a home fire? This doesn't preclude
you having at least one fire extinguisher within reach somewhere, if
you're smart. And an empty (unloaded) fire extinguisher isn't going to
do you much good when you need it most.

**Is \"home defense\" a valid reason to have a loaded firearm?**

I compromise slightly on this, but it's my personal choice. I like the
intimidation factor of racking the slide on my M&P .40, or allowing the
bolt to slam forward on my M4. It's akin to racking a shell into a
shotgun: nothing beats that sound. Plus, I've trained doing just that a
million times, so I'm fully confident in my ability to get a round in
the chamber in less than a second.

So the guns in my house which are prepared for home defense sit in
Condition 3 (full magazine inserted, chamber empty). I need only rack
the slide or charge the weapon to make it ready to fire. I know this,
but I'm the one who will be using these weapons should they need to be
employed, so I'm willing to take the extra second to do that, even
knowing that gunfights are usually over within five seconds.

It's a small compromise, but it enhances the safety of the weapons,
while still leaving them in a state where they could be made ready in
less than a second.

So do I have a "loaded firearm?" I would say that I don't, but it could
be loaded in less than a second. It's about as close as you can get to
having a loaded weapon without actually having a loaded weapon.

Maybe something like this will assist you in your decision.

By the way, I always carry handguns in what is commonly known as
Condition 2 in the "four condition" spectrum where Condition 4 is "safe
and clear." Condition 2 is when there is a round in the chamber and the
hammer is down (uncocked). There is usually no external safety, but for
example my gun can optionally have one. If it does, that safety is OFF.
Most \'modern\' handguns like the SIG, Glock, H&K, S&W, and other DA/SA
autoloaders are designed to be carried this way (first shot DA, rest
SA). These guns typically have two or three internal safeties that block
the firing pin, and disconnect the sear & trigger so that the gun may
only be fired by pulling the trigger. This type of gun is quite safe in
this mode (our instructor said you could literally hammer nails with a
gun in this condition; we decided not to test that), whereas SAO (single
action only) autoloaders are not. Again, I train with my guns this way,
so I understand how it feels and I'm ready for that.
