First of all, let's address the elephant in the room. Despite what
someone may have told you, no translation of the Bible has "added" or
"subtracted" anything of substance to any book of the Bible. I challenge
anyone to show me where brand new text, "out of whole cloth," as we say,
has been either added or subtracted, from the Bible, from any version.
Show me the original text, and then show me what was added or
subtracted.

That said, doing translations between languages can be challenging, and
translating anything out of Greek is no exception. For example, there
are *seven* Greek words for love, and there are at least two Greek words
for rock. The different words describe different "contexts" of the word.
In the case of love, words like *eros*, which means romantic love,
*philos*, which means intimate friendship, *storge*, which means
familial love, and *agape*, which means universal emphatic love, all
exist. But we only have one word in English. So how do you translate it?
If you just say "love" when you see one of the seven Greek words for
love, you lose quite a bit of context. So since the very first
translation, there has been a debate between a "word-for-word"
translation, and a "sense-for-sense" translation. Both types of
translations exist, and the debate over which kind is best continues
today.
