If we consider the historical value of the statues, and the educational
value they still possess, then the statues should not be destroyed. They
should be carefully removed and relocated to a more appropriate
location, such as a memorial section in a park, or a museum.

Perhaps pieces with more artistic value should be relocated to museums,
but I assume that each city possessing one of these statues should do
with it as is appropriate, but I hardly think that destroying all of
them *en masse* is appropriate.
