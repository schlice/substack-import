I love these questions. It's as if we've been trying endlessly to just
ban those darn guns, but that pesky Second Amendment is always in the
way.

But maybe this time will be different. Maybe this school shooting will
be the one which pushes those crazy MAGA Republicans over the edge and
they finally say "enough is enough, this is one child too many" and we
just seize all the guns and we're just done with it.

And if this is how you think, I've got a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you.

We've answered this question a million times on this platform
(incidentally, this same question pops up after every school shooting),
the answer remains the same.

***THE TOOL IS NOT THE PROBLEM. THE SHOOTER IS THE PROBLEM.***

More teens die in teen-related car accidents than in school shootings,
but we don't call for bans on teen driving.

Terrorists used a pressure cooker to create a bomb and kill people at
the Boston Marathon, but you don't see any calls to regulate pressure
cookers.

Terrorists used rental trucks to mow down large crowds of people, but
you don't see any calls to limit civilian usage of rental trucks.

**It is a given** that Constitutionally protected, easy access to
firearms will allow someone to use that tool to commit murder, just as
easy access to rental trucks allows terrorists to rent one and mow down
a crowd of pedestrians, or easy access to pressure cookers allows
terrorists to get one and build a bomb. If a tool exists, people will
use that tool for good or for evil. That's not the fault of the tool.
It's the fault of the person using the tool.

The common thread is **murder**. The tool is ancillary. Firearms are the
easy target because they are designed to kill. That's not bad or good;
badness or goodness are determined by the circumstances of their use;
not that they actually cause death.

So **yes, the fact that we have relatively easy access to firearms means
that murderers can use those tools to commit murders.** ***Taking the
tool away will not stop the murder. It will just modify the choice of
tool.***
