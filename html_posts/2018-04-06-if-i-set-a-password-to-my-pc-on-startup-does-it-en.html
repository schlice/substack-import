**If I set a password to my PC on startup, does it encrypt the hard
disk?**

The answer is "it depends."

In most cases, your "password to your PC on startup" is what we call a
**BIOS password**. This password prevents the motherboard from booting
the hard disk until a password is entered. In general, this *does not*
encrypt the hard drive. It simply prevents the disk from being booted.

There are several methods by which you can encrypt your hard drive so
that it is protected during boot, and many of them require on-board
hardware called a Trusted Platform Module (TPM). Using Microsoft
operating systems in conjunction with a TPM can provide you with full
device encryption as well as pre-boot authentication and decryption
before boot.

Later versions of Windows can also provide encryption without using a
TPM by encrypting the user partition separately from the boot partition.
The unencrypted boot partition starts first, then the user
authentication occurs, and that allows access to the encrypted user
partition.
