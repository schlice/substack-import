Short answer: that\'s not for you to decide.

Longer answer: The officer who lights you up expects you to safely move
your vehicle to the shoulder when he does. The law doesn\'t allow you to
determine whether or not the area is "safe\" to stop in. If you stop and
the officer believes the area is unsafe, he will tell you to move using
the PA system.

If you abrogate a police officer\'s responsibility onto yourself, you
risk additional charges.

The only time I would ever suggest not doing is if it is an unmarked car
attempting to stop you and you are alone. In that case, immediately call
911 and find out if the car behind you is real. If it is, you must
immediately stop. In that case, and only in that case, slow down, move
to the right-hand lane, and activate your hazard flashers. You should be
doing this while you are on the phone with the 911 dispatcher. It's
still illegal, but the officer should understand.

I know some departments (ours included) generally will not use unmarked
vehicles for traffic enforcement, for that very reason. Some agencies,
like our state patrol, however, specifically use unmarked vehicles to
catch willful traffic violators. That said, the above likely doesn't
apply on the interstate. It's well-lit, and you're never alone. It would
be difficult to claim you're all alone on a well-lit interstate with
hundreds of cars passing you by. If you get lit up on the freeway, you'd
better be stopping.
