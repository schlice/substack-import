**What could be a non-lethal alternative to traditional guns?**

***Phasers.***

Yep, the Star Trek ones: handheld nuclear reactors producing instantly
disabling beams of light, targeted at one person, and instantly
"stunning" them, regardless of their size, physical composition, or
amount of clothing worn.

Oh, did you want something that exists ***today?***

Then the answer is ***nothing***.

Guns are lethal weapons. Therefore, non-lethal alternatives to
traditional guns are *anything which is not a gun.*

But if you need lethal force, are you going to reach for a "non-lethal
alternative?" That would not make much sense, would it? The old line,
which was originally from the 1987 movie *The Untouchables,* says,
"Isn\'t that just like a wop? Brings a knife to a gun fight."

In other words, you use the right tool for the job.
