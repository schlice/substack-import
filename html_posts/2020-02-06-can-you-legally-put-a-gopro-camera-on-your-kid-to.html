**Can you legally put a GoPro camera on your kid to keep track of them
at school and during the day?**

*Inside* of the school, you will likely run into the same issues with
putting a GoPro on your kid as you would with anyone taking a GoPro into
many areas in the school, such as locker rooms and bathrooms.

Additionally, the school has the right to control students' use of
electronics, as teachers legally act *in loco parentis* in most cases.
The school can simply claim that the camera interrupts the basic
operation of the school, and they can ban it or turn it off. If the
child refuses, they can send him home.

*Outside* of school, your kid can do whatever he likes when he's out in
public, including recording anything he sees. Clearly, he is bound by
any other recording device restriction (such as the aforementioned
bathrooms and locker rooms).
