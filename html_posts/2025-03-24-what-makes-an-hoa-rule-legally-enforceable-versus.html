Applicability.

The HOA rule in question **must apply equally to all homeowners.**

Without some compelling reason, if the HOA crafts a rule which only
applies to certain homeowners, there is a better than average chance
that the rule is discriminatory.

Additionally, a legally enforceable rule which, **in practice**, is
applied unequally (i.e. two homeowners, in exactly the same scenarios,
and the HOA applies the rule to one homeowner and not to another), may
also be discriminatory.

\

There are some situations which *appear* discriminatory, but which are
not.

One of these is in the practice of enforcing architectural design
standards. The Architecture Review Committee (or whatever your HOA calls
it) has **sole authority** to determine whether to approve any
particular change, and *just because they approved another homeowner's
similar change is* ***not a guarantee*** *that they will approve yours.*
Perhaps the placement of the change in your unique situation is
different, or the position of your lot is different, or any number of
additional factors may dissuade the ARC from approving your change.

A second HOA practice which may appear discriminatory but is not is the
practice of *uniformly* failing to enforce a particular CC&R provision.
For example, I served on a Board which had a rule that said basically
"no street parking ever." In our HOA, we chose to not enforce that rule,
in part, because the County already had *single side of the street
parking* set up, and they used county enforcement (the local sheriff's
department) to handle parking violations. They had county No Parking
signs set up on one side of the street, and you could call the Sheriff's
Office to have a deputy come out and ticket/tow illegally parked
vehicles. Therefore, the Board chose to not enforce the "no street
parking ever" provision of our CC&Rs, and this was perfectly legal and
not discriminatory, because we **uniformly** enforced (or in this case,
didn't enforce) that rule. In other words, it's just as
non-discriminatory to uniformly not enforce a rule as it is to uniformly
enforce a rule.
