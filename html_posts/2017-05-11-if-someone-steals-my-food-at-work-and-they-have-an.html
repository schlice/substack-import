In order for you to get into legal trouble in such a circumstance, you
would either have to be actively violating rules regarding allergens in
a shared location (such as an office refrigerator), or you were actively
attempting to deceive the person into eating your (tainted) food over
his own.

There has to be some element of *mens rea* in order for you to get into
trouble (i.e. some nefarious intent), or some active disregard of a rule
designed to protect persons with allergies, which would constitute
reckless endangerment, or something similar.

If someone with an allergy actively takes your food, knowing that they
do not have permission and have no control over the ingredients, and
they eat it, they are knowingly taking food over which they have no
control. At that point, they take their own health into their hands when
they do that.
