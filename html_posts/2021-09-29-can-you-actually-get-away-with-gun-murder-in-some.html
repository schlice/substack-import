No. Murder is illegal in all 50 states.

But it's going to be important here to define what constitutes murder,
since you asked the question.

In common legal parlance (and still active in federal law), **murder is
the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought.**

So let's unpack this:

- **unlawful**: this implies that some killing is lawful. For example,
  when the state executes someone who has been duly convicted of a crime
  and sentenced by a competent jury to death.
- **killing**: this means your actions directly caused a death.
- **human being**: you can't murder a dog.
- **malice aforethought**: ah, that classic turn of phrase that really
  trips everyone up. Let's dig into that one.

"Malice aforethought" is the mental state (also known as the *mens rea*)
required to prove first degree murder in federal law and in some states.
Generally, a killing doesn't qualify as murder in the first degree
unless it is done after premeditation and deliberation. So a killing in
the heat of passion would not qualify.

Most states have abandoned the "malice aforethought" language, and
instead have adopted language which is more precise that "malice." Most
have adopted language which refers to intent and premeditation.

So can you get away with gun murder? If you're not caught.
