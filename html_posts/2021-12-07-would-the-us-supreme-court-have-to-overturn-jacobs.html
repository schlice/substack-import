*Jacobson v. Massachusetts* was a case which established that the state
can compel *private citizens* to get a vaccine under the state's police
powers.

Some states have already been requiring *businesses* to vaccinate all of
their workers. This is a different style of mandate than was created by
*Jacobson*. This is more of a workplace health and safety directive than
a broad vaccine mandate for the entire state population, which is what
was held to be Constitutional by *Jacobson.*

So no, it's unlikely that SCOTUS would have to strike down *Jacobson*
**** in order to overturn New York's private-sector mandate.

But regardless, SCOTUS has not interfered with state-level mandates,
either for or against, so it is unlikely that SCOTUS would interfere
here either.

They *have*, however, stepped in when the Federal government attempted
to compel private companies to mandate vaccinations, as they do not have
the authority to do so.

Original question:

Would the U.S. Supreme Court have to overturn Jacobson vs. Massachusetts
to strike down New York City's recent vaccine mandate for most
private-sector workers?
