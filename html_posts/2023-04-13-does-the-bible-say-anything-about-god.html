Of course it does.

*But! But! But! It never directly says \"abortion!\"*

This is true; the Bible never specifically says the word "abortion." But
there are abundant Scriptural references that make God's position on
abortion crystal clear.

> "Before I formed you in the womb I knew you,\
> and before you were born I consecrated you;\
> I appointed you a prophet to the nations." --- Jeremiah 1:5 ESV

This says that God knew us before He formed us in the womb.

> For you formed my inward parts;\
> you knitted me together in my mother's womb.\
> I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.\
> Wonderful are your works;\
> my soul knows it very well.\
> My frame was not hidden from you,\
> when I was being made in secret,\
> intricately woven in the depths of the earth.\
> Your eyes saw my unformed substance;\
> in your book were written, every one of them,\
> the days that were formed for me,\
> when as yet there was none of them. --- Psalm 139:13--16

This psalm talks about God's direct role in our creation and formation
in the womb.

> "When men strive together and hit a pregnant woman, so that her
> children come out, but there is no harm, the one who hit her shall
> surely be fined, as the woman's husband shall impose on him, and he
> shall pay as the judges determine. But if there is harm, then you
> shall pay life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand,
> foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, stripe for stripe. ---
> Exodus 21:22--25

So let's talk about Exodus 21, which abortion advocates believe means
that the Bible condones abortion because it's "a property crime if the
baby dies, but if the mother dies, it's murder."

Not quite. This passage prescribes the same penalty---death---for
someone who causes the death of a baby in the womb as for someone who
commits murder. This law and its punishment clearly indicate that God
considers a baby in the womb to be just as much a human being as a
full-grown adult.

In other words, if the only consequence of the men's fighting was that
the woman gave birth prematurely, but she and the baby were ultimately
unharmed, then the worst that would happen was that the offender would
pay a fine determined by the husband and approved by the judges. The law
did not address every loss or consequence, but it did ensure that
*permanent* consequences were justly compensated.

If the mother, baby, or both were injured, the husband of the baby's
mother, along with the judges, would decide on a fair punishment. If a
life was lost, however, the law specified that the offender would also
lose his life.

For Christians, abortion is not a matter of a woman's right to choose to
have a baby. The baby is already present and living. Abortion is a
matter of the life or death of a human being made in God's image

**TL;DR: The Bible** ***very clearly*** **says abortion is murder. It is
the unlawful, unjust killing of a human being created in the image of
God.**
