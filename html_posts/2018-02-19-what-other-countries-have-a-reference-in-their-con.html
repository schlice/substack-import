**What other countries have a reference in their constitution to \"a
well-regulated militia\" (or equivalent)?**

What other countries in the world have governments founded on a document
(i.e. not a monarchy, a dictatorship, an oligarchy, or a religion) since
their inception?

What other countries can claim that they successfully used the same
piece of paper for over 250 years?

What other countries can claim that they have been able to peaceably
transfer power between leaders for that entire time?

*Answer to all of the above: none other than the US*

So you can't even get to your question because no other country can say
that they have had a successful Constitutional republic for as long as
we have.
