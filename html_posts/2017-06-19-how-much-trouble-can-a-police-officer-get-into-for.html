Pulling anyone over when you don't have reasonable suspicion that they
have violated a law is in itself a violation of department policy. There
is no police department I am aware of that allows you to stop a vehicle
without at a minimum reasonable suspicion that they have committed a
violation.

How much trouble can an officer get into? He does have the authority to
stop cars, so what he did was not criminal. But he almost certainly
violated department policy, which could get him reprimanded, suspended,
or at worst, fired.
