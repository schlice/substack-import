**What should I do if I know someone (a 16-year-old) who asked for nudes
from a 10-year-old girl (and got them)? Should I report him, even though
he is legally not seen as a pedophile?**

Since you are not a cop, I don't expect you to act like a cop. I expect
you to act like a human, and find the best solution.

In this case, if you are not an adult (I don't know how old you are),
get an adult to help you, because the best solution would be to sit down
with both sets of parents, preferably together, but separately if you
must (and preferably at some public venue like a coffee shop) and
explain that even though both of their children are underage, in most
jurisdictions, they can legally be charged with distribution of, and
possession of, child pornography. (Oh, even better, if they text that
picture to someone in another *state,* now it's a Federal crime, and the
FBI handles it, and they're going to be a lot less lenient than your
local police department). Then you must explain that children who have
access to technology which has the means of taking photographs and
sending them electronically to others must be educated about the proper
use of said technology lest they find themselves on the wrong side of
the law. This could become a very bad situation, especially if that
photo finds its way onto the wider Web, from whence it will ***never***
disappear, and repercussions for the subject of the photo can be severe.
Finally, document your meeting if you can, and even better, record it if
you can.

At this point, if you can contain the situation, it's more of a
*parenting* issue than a *legal* issue, but as you can see, it can
easily become a legal issue unless the parents can get a handle on it
right away.

Look, I'm no saint, and I know my kids are going to be kids and they're
going to do stuff. I'm not stupid. So the rules for my boys state that
no matter what they do, they may not use drugs, they may not get girls
pregnant, and they may not request nor send nudes of any kind. They know
my rules, and they know that they'll probably not see much more than the
inside of the school and the inside of their rooms until they turn 18 if
they break them. As a parent, you must be able to have these
conversations with your children, especially if they have access to
electronics which can take pictures and send those pictures to other
devices.
