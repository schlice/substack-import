<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [My kids actually learned this in school. It was kinda like<br>singing the alphabet forwards, but just rhythmically, not to music.\<br>\<br>It was very interesting. I learned it along with them out of sheer<br>curiosity. I practiced it with them.\<br>\<br>So I can do it now.\<br>\<br>An interesting party trick, but not much useful for anything else.<br>Certainly not in an FST.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
