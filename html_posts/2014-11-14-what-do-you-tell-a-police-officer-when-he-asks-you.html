**Content:** [My kids actually learned this in school. It was kinda like
singing the alphabet forwards, but just rhythmically, not to music.\
\
It was very interesting. I learned it along with them out of sheer
curiosity. I practiced it with them.\
\
So I can do it now.\
\
An interesting party trick, but not much useful for anything else.
Certainly not in an FST.]{.rendered_qtext}
