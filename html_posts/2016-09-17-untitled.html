You're conflating **design** with **purpose**.

The **purpose** of a gun is to cause death in the target. The **design**
of the gun expels a projectile at high velocity in order to achieve its
purpose.

The **purpose** of a car is to transport people from one point to
another. The **design** of a car involves an internal combustion engine
producing power to drive wheels. When people sit inside the contraption,
and the engine drives the wheels, it achieves its **purpose**.

You can use anything against its intended purpose. Steering wheels were
designed to be operated with hands, but you could use your feet, I
suppose. The car will still work. You're just not using it according to
its design. Guns were indeed designed to achieve the purpose of killing,
but you can use them to put holes in paper, or trees, or to hammer
nails. Using it **in self defense** isn't going against its purpose. You
have promised to the criminal that you will use it for its stated
**purpose** if they don't stop their actions.
