(US-specific answer)

It's highly unlikely. Usually, a single offense takes place within a
single jurisdiction. You don't normally have a single offense taking
place in multiple jurisdictions.

If, for some reason, you have a single offense which occurs in more than
one jurisdictions, the two will collaborate on your prosecution.
Ultimately, only one will actually move to indict.
