**I was born a girl but I feel like I should have been born a boy. I\'ve
been questioning my gender for ages but I was wondering if anyone knew
if this was a sign of gender dysphoria?**

Gender dysphoria is a *disorder* (although many of the modern medical
associations have quietly disassociated themselves from that word)
wherein which a person feels that they do not fit their birth gender. It
has some very definable characteristics:

1.  A marked incongruence between one's experienced/expressed gender and
    primary and/or secondary sex characteristics
2.  A strong desire to be rid of one's primary and/or secondary sex
    characteristics
3.  A strong desire for the primary and/or secondary sex characteristics
    of the other gender
4.  A strong desire to be of the other gender
5.  A strong desire to be treated as the other gender
6.  A strong conviction that one has the typical feelings and reactions
    of the other gender

There is treatment available for gender dysphoria. However, you didn't
mention how old you are. You said you've been questioning your gender
for "ages" but you didn't mention how many ages. This is important
because treatment for gender dysphoria is markedly different if you are
a child as opposed to an adult.

- *Children with gender dysphoria:* treatment typically involves a
  multi-disciplinary team of health care professionals, which may
  include a pediatrician, a psychiatrist, other mental health
  professionals, a pediatric endocrinologist (specialists in hormone
  conditions in children) and an advocate. Treatment may focus primarily
  on affirming psychological support, understanding feelings and coping
  with distress, and giving children a safe space to articulate their
  feelings. Parents of children with gender dysphoria may also benefit
  from counseling. **For many children the feelings do not continue into
  adolescence and adulthood.**
- *Adolescents and adults with gender dysphoria:* treatment options
  include counseling, cross-sex hormones, puberty suppression, and
  gender reassignment surgery. Some adults may have a strong desire to
  be of a different gender and to be treated as a different gender
  without seeking medical treatment or altering their body. They may
  only want support to feel comfortable in their gender identity. Others
  may want more extensive treatment including hormone treatment and
  gender reassignment surgery leading to a transition to the opposite
  sex. Some may choose hormone treatment or surgery alone.

Individual therapy can help a person understand and explore their
feelings and cope with the distress and conflict. Couples therapy or
family therapy may be helpful to improve understanding and to create a
supportive environment. Peer support groups for adolescents and adults
and parent/family support groups can also be helpful.
