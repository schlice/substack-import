President Obama, in a January 2008 interview with the San Francisco
Chronicle editorial board, said, "Under my plan...electricity rates
would necessarily skyrocket."

This was Obama touting his plan for "cap and trade," which would kill
the fossil fuel industry by pricing it out of existence. This was to
push his "green energy" agenda.

Thankfully, "cap and trade" died in the Senate in 2010, leaving the EPA
holding the bag. And their greenhouse gas regulations for future power
plants, which were specifically designed to cripple the coal industry,
caused many plants to shut down, and canceled many more plans to build
new plants, which sent electricity costs skyrocketing (just as Obama
predicted).

This is a perfect example of government intentionally causing
hyperinflation to push a political agenda.
