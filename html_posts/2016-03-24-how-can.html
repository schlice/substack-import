The same state motor vehicle code which lists the infraction, in
general, allows for the state to employ parking enforcement agents who
are not sworn peace officers. If it\'s not in the motor vehicle code,
it\'s in the city or state statutes. This only makes sense from a
cost-saving perspective. It costs the state far more to equip, train,
and employ a peace officer than it does to equip, train, and employ a
parking enforcement agent. There are no \"functions\" which are
exclusively \"reserved\" for peace officers other than what is specified
in city or state statutes. It is purely statutory, and the state can
choose to farm out enforcement of any city code to any agency.

For example, our school district security has the power to write city
parking tickets, which are fully enforceable in municipal court. This
was done through city regulation, so if you\'re parking unlawfully in a
fire zone or handicapped spot in one of our school parking lots, school
security can write you a parking ticket which the city will log and
track.
