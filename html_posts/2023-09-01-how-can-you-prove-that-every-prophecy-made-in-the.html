You can't prove that. Because each prophecy could have happened
spontaneously to someone else.

But if you believe that the Bible is true (and we have evidence that
shows us beyond a reasonable doubt that it is), and the Bible says that
all of these prophecies were fulfilled in the life of Jesus, then we
have reason to believe that it is true.

You cannot prove that every prophecy made in the Bible concerning Christ
was fulfilled in Him alone. But if you believe in the truth of the
Bible, and the Bible says that it happened, then you can rest assured
that they all were fulfilled in His sinless life.
