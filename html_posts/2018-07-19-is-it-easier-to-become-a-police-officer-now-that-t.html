**Is it easier to become a police officer now that there is so much
demand for them?**

The answer is no.

Yes, there is more *demand* for police officers. We have many spots
which need to be filled.

However, the demand for officers does not change the entrance
requirements.

You would think that with such great need for officers that perhaps we
should *lower the standards* for an officer candidate, right? I mean,
you'd get more people to *pass* the entrance requirements if you just
made it *easier* to pass.

Except, if you really stop and think about it, I don't really think
anyone wants that.

People already rail on about how police officers are racist and bigoted
and obviously didn't pass any psychological screenings when they were
hired.

This, of course, is simply untrue.

But why, in the same breath, do we say, "Well, we need more
psychological screenings before we hire police officers, but boy, we're
short on cops, so let's skip the whole psych screening and just let
anyone join."

Doesn't make much sense, does it.

So while there is a greater demand for new officers, the standards by
which we determine whether or not someone will be appointed to the
police academy do not, and should not, change.

The only way we can get more officers into the academy is to get more
people to apply to be police officers. The way to accomplish that is not
by making standards lower. Maybe a good start would be to make pay
higher. That would attract more applicants.

But making it easier to become an officer? No, definitely not an option.
And if you stop and think about it, you don't really want that.
