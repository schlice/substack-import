I'll not try to say that this has never happened in the past, but it
rarely happens today. Police do not have the flexibility to work
"outside the system" anymore. The advent of cameras everywhere and
advanced forensic analysis have made it virtually impossible to get away
with such antics today.

Besides, qualified immunity has gotten so limited that it's better for
an officer to just keep his head down and not get himself into stupid
situations than to shoot first and ask questions later. Proactive
policing has virtually vanished in most major cities today.

Which is the cause, by the way, of what we are seeing now: the biggest
increase in violent crime in over two decades.

It's nice to put your cops on a short leash, but there is a steep price
to pay for that leash, and the bill is coming due today.
