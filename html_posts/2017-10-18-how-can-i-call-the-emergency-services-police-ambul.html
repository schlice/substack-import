If you travel internationally, you should always record in your phone
the direct-dial number to your local emergency services back home. In
America, you actually reach the same 911 operator, but you use a
"non-emergency" line to do it. Being that you are actually out of the
country, I think that the operator would give you a pass for reporting
an emergency on the non-emergency line.
