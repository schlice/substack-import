**If a guy with a gun in his pocket, deliberately gets drunk, then kills
someone by shooting them, but doesn\'t remember it because he was drunk,
should it be considered first degree murder because he deliberately got
drunk with a gun?**

No, because it doesn't meet the definition of first-degree murder.

The crime of first-degree murder requires three elements:

1.  The unlawful taking of a life
2.  with forethought
3.  and malice.

The malice (or the *mens rea*, the guilty mind) simply isn't there in
this case.

This is *possibly* a case of **second-degree murder,** but that is
unlikely.

This is *most likely* a case of **criminally-negligent homicide.**

Second degree murder requires only the first two (the unlawful taking of
a life with forethought). The *mens rea* is not there. It could be
argued that carrying a gun while getting drunk constitutes forethought,
but it's unlikely that the person got drunk with a gun planning on it
leading to someone's death. In some cases though, it could be argued as
such, so we'll leave it in there, but it's unlikely.

What we are most likely looking at is **criminal negligence**.
Negligence is a word in law which means a failure to exercise reasonable
care, either through careless action, or inaction. Reasonableness is
based on the "reasonable person" test: what would a reasonable person do
in the same situation. *Criminal* negligence is negligence that a
reasonable person would know, or should know, could result in someone's
death.

Carrying a gun while drinking is, without a doubt, criminal negligence.

Carrying a gun while drinking is not first-degree murder.
