**What controls are there over stopping an unhinged POTUS from making
false claims of crimes against people such as treason or comments to
incite a civil war?**

Nothing.

Nothing stops anyone from making "false claims" of anything. Just look
at how many men's lives have been destroyed by false claims of rape, yet
these still occur. What controls are in place to stop an unhinged woman
from making false claims of rape? In fact, the 1st Amendment prevents
the government from abridging speech. This allows anyone to slander
anyone else, but that's a claim that happens *after* the speech is made.
Nothing stops the person from speaking.

If someone makes a claim of a crime (otherwise known as reporting a
crime), the appropriate law enforcement agency investigates and
determines whether or not there is enough evidence to warrant further
investigation. Either there is, or there's not.

And as for "comments to incite a civil war," if someone were to make
those comments, they would be charged with inciting violence.

**And at what point are the people around the POTUS held accountable for
doing nothing?**

It's Congress' job to impeach the President so that he can be charged
with a crime. He can't be indicted while he's President, as he controls
all indictments in the country. All power of indictment comes from the
President.

If Congress knows that the President broke the law by inciting violence
and does not impeach him, then it's up to **you**, dear American voter,
to not re-elect those Congresspeople and instead elect some who will, oh
I don't know, *actually do their jobs.*
