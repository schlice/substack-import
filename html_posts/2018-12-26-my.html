**My \"loving, caring, Christian\" family is incredibly xenophobic,
racist and homophobic; how do I address their hypocrisy?**

1.  Kindly call them out when they talk/act this way. As in, "Wow, that
    was just a little bit racist, don't you think?"
2.  If you can't take their crap any more, it's time to distance
    yourself from them. Yeah, I had to do this.
