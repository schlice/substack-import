**Content:** [1. Healthcare is expensive. From pharmaceutical companies,
to durable medical equipment manufacturers, to hospitals, healthcare is
one of the costliest fields to be a part of. Simply changing the payer
from insurance companies to the government is not possible. Half of your
paycheck would go to taxes just to fund the medical system (and that\'s
after cost controls). Where do I come up with half? Ask a Canadian how
much of his paycheck goes to taxes.\
\
2. This also amounts to a ***government takeover*** of the entire
medical system, and most Americans are skeptical of anything that
government takes over. For two brilliant, shining examples of how
\"efficiently\" government runs things, one need only look at the US
Postal Service and Amtrak. Since the government took over those two
enterprises, they have *lost money* every single year they have been in
operation. They are **money pits.** Why? The government is not good at
for-profit business. They\'re good at not-for-profit business, and they
don\'t therefore care if their businesses are not profitable, or even if
they lose money. They\'re not accountable to any shareholders, so who
cares if the business loses money? Just dump more taxpayer dollars into
it.\
\
In order for government to successfully fund the medical system, they
would not only have to take it over, but they would have to eliminate
healthcare insurance, as well as implementing cost controls onto
healthcare providers. Without a market controlling this interaction,
most healthcare providers would leave the profession and would seek
gainful employment elsewhere, rather than becoming low-paid government
employees.\
\
It is possible for government to implement universal healthcare within
our current system, but they would have to create *tiered* healthcare.
They would have to create government-funded local clinics to handle the
majority of healthcare needs. The private system would still be in place
as a Tier 2 option for people who need it. They would have to be cleared
through a Tier 1 doctor before they would be able to move into Tier 2.
The insurance companies could still operate here, as well as specialist
doctors, surgeons, ERs, and other acute care. The largest majority of
basic healthcare needs could be met in the Tier 1 facilities, while the
Tier 2 facilities would still operate much as they do today, but with
lower caseload.\
\
Yes, there are still gaps. There are areas where people would not be
able to see a Tier 2 doctor because they don\'t have health insurance.
Perhaps the efficiencies in the new system will allow some government
subsidies to be used for patients (as referred by Tier 1 docs) to see
Tier 2 doctors, but they will have to include some cost-sharing with the
patient. Doctors and insurance companies will have to look for ways to
reduce the cost to the end user.\
\
But where will you get doctors to staff the Tier 1 facilities? Won\'t
all the money-hungry bastards simply stay in Tier 2 practice and never
work in Tier 1? It\'s actually pretty simple. Fund their medical school
with government grants. Make them pay back their medical school with
time in the Tier 1 clinic. Make them do their residency and the first
five years of their practice in a Tier 1 clinic. Also, open up
inner-city Tier 1 clinics to groups like Doctors Without Borders. They
may have to change their name to Doctors Within Borders, but at least
the acronym (DWB) can stay the same.]{.rendered_qtext}
