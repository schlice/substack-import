**What will be the legacy of President Donald J. Trump?**

*"One ahshit will wipe out ten attaboys."*

That's what my boss used to tell me. What does that mean? You can get
congratulated up and down, but if you screw up because you're an idiot,
that's what people will remember.

Jan 6, 2021 will be the day that people remember. They won't remember
Russia, or his historic victory over Hillary Clinton when literally
everyone said he'd lose by double-digits, or his tax cuts, or even
Coronavirus and the chorus on both sides of the aisle that alternatively
said that he saved millions or he killed millions.

This is what they'll remember.

They'll remember the whiny, petulant little boy who couldn't lose with
dignity. Even after the voters, the states, and the courts all weighed
in and certified that he lost (if only by the narrowest of margins, but
an L is still an L), this is what they'll remember.

They'll remember the guy who didn't condemn violence until later.
They'll remember the guy who some claim incited the violence with his
speech. Whether you believe that he did or not, you can't deny the
timing. Speech in the morning, storming the castle in the evening.

This is what they'll remember.

(EDIT) And if Democrats in Congress have their way, they may impeach him
again before he leaves office. Then, his legacy will be the only
president to be impeached twice while in office.

This will go down in history, and this will be the Trump legacy.
