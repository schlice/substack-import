**Content:** [It sounds like we both (police and the citizens they
serve) have created a self-perpetuating cycle of fear and caution around
each other.\
\
I think you have a deep-seated hatred for cops. Yes, hate is a strong
word. But I think it applies. I know it\'s not conscious, and we\'ll get
there in a minute. But I think the problem is your perception of police
officers\' behaviors. I\'m not saying that cops are angels, we all know
they are not always model citizens. But we all need to give a little in
order to overcome that mistrust.\
\
But let\'s get into a little bit about what you\'ve said, and see if we
can find some of the cognitive bias that leads you to your repulsion.\
\
*Why do they look all arrogant and hostile, even at lunch, try to take
more space than the can naturally take?*\
\
I\'m not sure exactly what you mean by \"taking more space than they can
naturally take\". If you mean that they take a four-top table when there
are only two of them, that may stem from a number of factors:\
\
- They feel less insecure when there is more defensible space around
them\
- They don\'t naturally interact well with the general public in social
situations\
- They are generally worried that someone might try to tamper with their
food because they just don\'t like cops.\
\
They also know that ***everyone*** is watching them, everywhere they go.
In this day and age, no other profession is so closely scrutinized as
police. We should monitor politicians as closely as we monitor police.
In what other job can you step out of your car and have 10 cameras
trained on you recording your every action? Unless you\'re a rock star,
the only other time this happens is if you\'re a cop. And they don\'t
want those videos for *memorabilia,* they want them to *indict* you*.*
Sounds like a great way to spend the day, don\'t you think?\
\
Interaction is a two-way street, and interaction with the public is a
big area where cops can improve, and it\'s an area where I think I am
uniquely qualified to help. I\'m a *volunteer.* I don\'t get paid by a
police department. I\'m not a full-time cop. Think of us in the same way
you think of volunteer firefighters: fully trained to do the job, fully
certified, just part-time volunteers instead of full-time paid officers.
I try to do this every time I am working: have a conversation with
someone that doesn\'t end in any hard feelings, but with a smile and a
\"have a good day.\" I really do try to do this. It\'s an effort,
because people are openly hostile with the police. But that doesn\'t
stop me from trying. This task would be much harder for a full-time
officer who faces this abuse every day.\
\
*Why do they sir/ma\'m you, in our very informal state? Nobody else
ma\'ms me, except for telephone sales people, and I don\'t like it.*\
\
Officers are required to be extra polite, all the time. If you can force
yourself to not project an attitude of rudeness, try to say, \"And
please don\'t call me ma\'am; I don\'t like it.\" I bet you most
officers would say, \"Oh, I\'m sorry, it\'s something that is required
for us. I\'ll try to watch it. I may slip now and then, but I\'m trained
that way, I don\'t mean to offend you.\"\
\
Personally, I was brought up to respect police officers. \"The man in
blue is a friend to you\" was the mantra I lived by. I treat everyone I
speak with to \"yes sir\" or \"yes ma\'am\", but also because I am a
former military officer. It\'s simply a polite way to address someone. I
address all police officers in that way; as a police officer, I
similarly treat people with the same respect that I would expect they
treat me with. We used to call it the \"Golden Rule\" when I was growing
up: \"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.\" We seem to
have lost that in society, along with lots of other
culturally-acceptable things like chivalry. I expect nothing less when
people communicate with me.\
\
*Why can\'t they be more human?*\
\
This one you\'re going to have to clarify for me.\
\
*Firefighters have command presence, too, but you just know they are the
good guys.*\
\
And here is where we have identified your learned distrust for police
officers.\
\
My training sergeant told us on our first day, \"If you want to be
loved, be a firefighter.\" The implication was \"because no one loves
cops.\" While that\'s not exactly true (fewer people love cops than
firefighters), it is a truism in today\'s society that people generally
perceive firefighters as \"helpful\" and police officers as
\"harmful.\"\
\
Why is that?\
\
Police officers can arrest you, firefighters cannot.\
\
Naturally, going to jail is uncomfortable. Sitting on your hands for a
30-minute car ride is uncomfortable. Getting booked into the jail is
uncomfortable. Not to mention the time lost from work, and the potential
for a permanent criminal record, which can seriously damage your life.\
\
But let\'s be realistic. Are cops *really* out to get ***you***? Are
cops really thinking in their heads, \"Let\'s find some moron to arrest
today\"? Not even close. Cops want to do their jobs, arrest the bad
guys, and go home with no more extra holes than they left the house
with. They are not interested in \"jamming anyone up.\" They simply want
to get the bad guys and go home.\
\
So the only reason you truly have to be worried is when you\'re a bad
guy. Other than that, it\'s your learned perception of police that is
coloring your view of them.\
\
It may be that you believe police are only there as revenue tools for
the state. If that\'s your belief, you have to take that up with the
state for writing the laws that the police are enforcing. \"Don\'t shoot
the messenger\" is the quote that comes to mind.\
\
*Then when they pull me over, I am instinctively repulsed by them, and
it shows, and they never give me a warning. Never.*\
\
Let\'s be clear about something. If you are pulled over, you have broken
a law. You do not have a right to a warning. If a police officer is
feeling exceedingly generous, he may choose not to write you a ticket,
but a lot of that depends on your attitude and your record. If you have
a reasonably clean record and are reasonably polite and cooperative, you
might get a warning, but there is no requirement for an officer to give
you a warning. Ever. If you were stopped, it\'s because you broke a law,
and that officer has every right to give you a ticket, and you have
every responsibility to try to do better next time.]{.rendered_qtext}
