None of our rights are absolute. Especially in the case where the free
exercise of one right intersects with someone else freely exercising
another right. This is where the law comes in. The law helps to define
the limits to the right, and what actions move from protected rights to
unlawful actions.

In the case of free speech, there are indeed some limitations.

- Obscenity. While this continues to be a moving target, obscenity is
  generally disallowed. What is considered obscene tends to change over
  time. This is more of an issue with print than with actual speech.
- Lying. Both in speech (slander) and in print (libel), lying is not
  legally permitted when the lie causes damage to a person or entity.
  You also cannot lie in court (perjury). However, political speech is
  subject to a different standard, and politicians can generally not be
  prosecuted for slander or libel in political speech. People also have
  pretty much free rein to criticize the government, even if their
  thoughts are wrong.
- Violence. You cannot incite violence by your speech. There is a very
  clear line between making a generalized speech and inciting violence.
  Many people presumed that President Trump's remarks on January 6 were
  an incitement of violence. While they were political speech and
  subject to a much higher level of scrutiny in general (see lying),
  they also did not directly incite violence. For example, if I say "We
  should kill all cops!" that would be acceptable to say, even if a
  crowd was whipped into a frenzy and killed a cop. But if I said, "We
  should all kill that cop right there!" and I pointed one out, and the
  crowd was whipped into a frenzy and killed the cop, I could be charged
  with inciting violence. The courts have stated that generalized
  statements cannot be incitements of violence because that incitement
  must be immediate and targeted. I also can say, "We should kill the
  President someday" and this would not be an incitement of violence
  because it is not specific. It talks about some nebulous time in the
  future
- Offense. Remember that the First Amendment applies to *government*,
  not to private citizens. You don't have the right to say whatever you
  want in someone else's home or other private space. You can be removed
  from that space for doing so. Also, if you are at work, your employer
  can control your speech. You can get fired for speaking in a manner in
  which your employer has directed you not to speak.
- Protest. While you are free to say whatever you want, you are not free
  to say whatever you want ***wherever*** or ***whenever*** you want.
  The government, while they cannot limit what you say, can limit the
  time, place, and manner of your speech. If you want to run a
  counter-protest at a political rally, the government can restrict you
  to a "free-speech zone" and it does not have to be in full view of the
  venue where the rally is taking place. You are not free to disrupt the
  rally simply because you wish to exercise your rights.
