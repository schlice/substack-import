Of course he should not be dropped from the team ***because*** he
exercised his right to stand or sit during the National Anthem. He would
do well to realize that the men and women in uniform have fought and
died to preserve his right to make that choice. His refusal to honor the
nation because he believes in a totally false cause is disturbing, but
is still his choice. Military members remember Voltaire's famous quote:
"I may disagree with what you say, but I will defend to the death your
right to say it." Military members do not take it as disrespect if
someone chooses to make a political statement. In fact, that means the
ideals we fought for are still in place, and that's a heartening
feeling.

The 49ers should be worried about losing something else: **fans**.
People watch Monday Night Football (and now Sunday and Thursday) because
they want to ***escape***. They want to get away from the turmoil of the
political sphere for a few hours, and escape into a simpler world which
involves nothing more than moving a ball. They want *entertainment.*
When players choose to use that platform and *politicize* it, they risk
alienating the very people who fund the leagues which pay him those
hefty salaries to use his athletic talents. If you start losing your
primary customers over your actions (regardless of how legal or proper
they are), you run the risk that your continued employment may
jeopardize the bottom line, and you **can** be dropped for that reason.

If you start distracting too much from the game, you can indeed be fired
for that. Kaepernick is a third-string quarterback, hardly the big draw
that the first and second string QBs are. He can be cut without too much
pain to the team. Making himself a distraction from ***the game*** does
not help strengthen the case for continued employment.
