**Do doctors in the US receive kickbacks from drug makers to prescribe
their medicines? If so, how much do they receive? My Dr. is very
particular on costly medicines which require pre-authorization and it
makes me feel suspicious.**

Doctors do not get paid for prescribing certain medications. In general,
doctors don't receive any money from drug manufacturers at all.

My neurologist was on a product advisory board for a few Multiple
Sclerosis drugs, and he was paid for that time. You may or may not know
that those drugs are **very** expensive. Without insurance, those drugs
would be prohibitively costly (to the tune of \~\$10,000 for a 30-day
supply). I often wondered about the same issue, especially because of
the advisory boards, so without pretense or accusation, I asked him
about it. Interestingly, he had already recommended that I **not** take
the drug that his advisory board had researched. He welcomed the
question, understood from whence it came, and was glad to share what he
received, when he received it, and he showed me how it was the efficacy
of the drug and how it fit my particular disease profile, and not his
time on any advisory boards, which prompted his decision to recommend
one drug over another.

I'm very plain with my doctor, and in situations like this, especially
where you have concerns or questions about reasonings for drug
recommendations, you should be too.
