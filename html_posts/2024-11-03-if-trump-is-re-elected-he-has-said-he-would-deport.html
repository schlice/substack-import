Continuing the poem you quoted (*The New Colossus* by Emma Lazarus) from
the base of the Statue:

> The wretched refuse of your teeming shore

Oof! "Wretched refuse?" That's what you call "immigrants"? And you think
that's valid? Maybe you should look closer at what you are espousing.
Because when Trump called these places "shitholes," you balked. But now
you're quoting the same poem which calls these people "wretched refuse?"
So shitholes is bad, but wretched refuse is good? I'm confused.

Anyway, let's continue, and I'll highlight what I'm talking about:

> Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me,\
> I lift my lamp beside **the golden door.**

I highlighted something in the last stanza of that poem: **the golden
door**. Hmm. So they come in through a "door." Why is it a "door?" So if
it's a door, can it be *closed*? So that means there is a "wall" in
which there is a "door" and you can only come in through the "door"?

Yes.

Because borders (walls) define the boundaries of our nation, and you
must come in through a process (the door) and we can decide, as a
nation, what that process is, and we can also define if we need to close
that door.

So yes, the President, who controls immigration policy, can determine
that people who came into our country ***not*** through the door must
leave and come in ***through*** the door.
