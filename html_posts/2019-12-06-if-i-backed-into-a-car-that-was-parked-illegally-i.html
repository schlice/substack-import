**If I backed into a car that was parked illegally in a no parking fire
lane, am I responsible for the damages?**

Yes.

The fact that the car was illegally parked has no bearing on the fact
that you hit it.

The unlawful parking is between the vehicle owner and the city, and is a
completely unrelated matter to your auto accident.
