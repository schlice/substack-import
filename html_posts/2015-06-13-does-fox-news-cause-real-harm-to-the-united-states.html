answer\
\
Does it cause real harm? Depends on what you call \"real harm.\" Does it
perpetuate an agenda instead of pure, unadulterated fact? Absolutely.\
\
Is that \"harmful?\" Only insofar as people will listen to exactly what
they want to hear, and not the pure, unadulterated truth. It \"harms\"
people because it doesn\'t allow for individuals to think for
themselves. It provides the facts, and also provides an opinion about
those facts.]{.rendered_qtext}
