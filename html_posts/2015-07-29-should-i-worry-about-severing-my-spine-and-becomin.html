**Content:** [Fears are normal. Everyone has them. Don\'t worry about
your fear. You don\'t need to decrease your fear; *you need to increase
your courage.*\
\
Mark Twain said, \"Courage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear, not
absence of fear.\" Fear helps to heighten your senses, make you sharper.
It increases adrenaline, which also enhances your senses and muscle
responses. So fear by itself is not a bad thing.\
\
Being paralyzed by your fear is an issue. If you simply cannot get past
your fear, there may be an underlying issue at play. If you can\'t move
past your fear, you should seek the advice of a licensed psychiatrist or
psychologist.\
\
Physiologically, unless you have some sort of disease (such as brittle
bone disease), the spine is not that easy to break. The spine is
surrounded by vertebrae, which can help to block impacts and prevent the
severing of the spinal cord. The human body is very resilient in that
way. It has existed for thousands of years in this shape, and has proven
to be very reliable. Spines don\'t routinely break for no
reason.]{.rendered_qtext}
