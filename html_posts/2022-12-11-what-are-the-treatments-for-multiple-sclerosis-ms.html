Please note that we are discussing medications for MS, but treating the
disease is a holistic endeavor. There is far more than just medications
to "managing" the disease. For more information about managing MS, take
a look at [[all of the resources on the National MS Society's
website](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1591de&url=https://www.nationalmssociety.org/Treating-MS){.external_link

just one part of that.

Currently, the best way to slow down the progression of the disease is
to use one of the approved MS therapy drugs. All of the therapy drugs do
the same thing:

- They slow the progression of the disease
- They increase the time between relapses
- They make relapses less severe and decrease the duration of relapses

The differences between the drugs have to do with the following:

- They have different levels of efficacy
- They have different methods of delivery
- They have different side effects

The drugs are delivered by one of three methods: *injection* (either
subcutaneous \[SC\] or intra-muscular \[IM\]), *infusion*, or *oral*.
Between them, they have different *efficacies* (how well they work), and
they absolutely have different side effects. For example, the
injectables and the infusion drugs have better efficacy than the oral
drugs, but the oral drugs are easier to take (a daily pill, usually).
But these are all *high-risk medications*, as they can produce some
pretty serious (and in some rare cases, life-threatening) side effects.

And while for many people it's not an issue, for some it may be: the
drugs are also very costly, and some insurance plans may approve one
drug and not another.

A good list of MS therapy drugs can be found at the National MS
Soceity's website:

Bottom line: talk with your neurologist about the treatment options
available in order to figure out which one is right for you.
