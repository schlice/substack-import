**I lost my mobile phone and someone else is using my account. What do I
do?**

- Call your carrier and have them suspend your account. They can do that
  immediately.
- Have them place your IMEI (your phone's hardware address) on the
  "stolen" list, so that it can't be re-activated on any other account
  or on any other carrier. That will essentially render it useless to
  the majority of bad guys. Only the most technically adept can change
  the IMEI, and on most flagship devices, even that doesn't work.
- Report your phone lost/stolen to the police. Do whatever they require
  you to do, but get a jacket number from their investigation
- Use your insurance benefit (you got insurance through your carrier,
  right?) to get yourself another handset. Since your phone is
  officially reported stolen (see the jacket number from the police from
  the last bullet), a replacement handset shouldn't be too expensive.
