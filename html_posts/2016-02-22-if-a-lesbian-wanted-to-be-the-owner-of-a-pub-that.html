In the United States, broadly, we are covered by Federal, state, and
local laws called the **Civil Rights Act of 1964**. It states that in
all places of \"public accommodation,\" discrimination on the basis of
race, color, creed (religion), sex, or national origin is illegal. Note
that at the Federal level, there is no protection for sexual
orientation.

While all states have a version of the Civil Rights Act that matches the
Federal statute, only about 20 states have included protection for
sexual orientation. And for those that do not have such protection, some
cities within those states have included sexual orientation for
protection.

So if a lesbian owned a pub and wanted to accept just lesbian customers,
she would have to do so in a city and state which does not have
protections against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.
Then, she could exclude everyone who is not a lesbian. However, this
would run afoul of the law banning discrimination on the basis of sex,
so she could still be sued for discrimination for failing to allow a man
into the pub (gay or straight). She likely couldn\'t be sued for denying
entrance to a straight woman, but denying entrance to any man would be
grounds for a discrimination lawsuit under both Federal and state law.
