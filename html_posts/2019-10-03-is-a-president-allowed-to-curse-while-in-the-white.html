**Is a president allowed to curse while in the White House?**

Of course he is. The 1st Amendment says (emphasis mine):

> **Congress shall make no law** respecting an establishment of

It probably doesn't comport with the decorum due to a place like the
White House, but it's certainly not illegal.
