I don't think it's either illegal or unethical. I just think if the
officer is not on official department business, it's just a bad idea.

Department policies vary widely, and there are almost as many policies
as there are departments. However, one thing is generally accepted among
most major departments in most cities with more than a few thousand
people in them: everything you do in uniform is a reflection of the
department. Everything. From stopping by the grocery store on the way
home to filling up your car at the gas station on the way in, everything
you do in uniform is a reflection of the department. Any time you wear
the uniform, you represent the department.

This is why, in most major departments, you don't wear your (full)
uniform while you travel. I know some guys who just wear their pants and
boots. They usually either wear a T-shirt or some other top, and
depending on the season, a jacket or coat. Other guys I know won't wear
any of their uniform components at all to and from the office. Once they
get to the office, they change into their full uniform to go on shift,
and then change again before leaving.

The goal, again, is to make sure that there is a clear delineation
between when you are on duty and representing the department, to when
you are off-duty and not representing the department.

Some small towns may not hold their officers or deputies to this rule,
as most people know who they are regardless of what they wear.

However, I'd say that wearing your uniform to an AA meeting, if you're
not there on official business, is a poor idea. The idea that someone
might be there who could act on your identity, especially while it is
supposed to be *anonymous*, would have a fairly chilling influence on
the meeting.
