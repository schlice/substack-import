**Content:** [[[Is it a crime to \"encourage suicide\"? Unusual
Massachusetts case of teens Conrad Roy and Michelle
Carter](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=981864&url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/is-it-a-crime-to-encourage-suicide-unusual-massachusetts-case-of-conrad-roy-and-michelle-carter/){.external_link

\
Since there is no one to report the crime, most likely the \"killer\"
will get away with it. It would be really difficult to prove, as all of
the evidence would be circumstantial.\
\
If the jurisdiction forbids it, the encourager could potentially face
assisted suicide charges, but criminal charges (like involuntary
manslaughter) would be really hard to prove and unlikely to last long in
court.]{.rendered_qtext}
