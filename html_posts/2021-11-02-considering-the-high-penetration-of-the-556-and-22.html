The weapon or ammunition you use does not change Rule 4 of the Big 4 Gun
Safety Rules:

**Know your target and what is behind your target**.

Yes, something which classically over-penetrates may not be the best
choice for an apartment dweller, but I won\'t deny them that choice.
Rule 4 still stands though, if that\'s what they choose. Don\'t forget
that a pistol can still over-penetrate, so it\'s not like pistol users
can ignore Rule 4.

A single family home may be different though. It might be easier to
ensure nothing is behind your target.

Plus, there is a lot to be said for accuracy in a neighborhood. I want
to hit what I am shooting at, and I have the best chance at that using a
rifle.
