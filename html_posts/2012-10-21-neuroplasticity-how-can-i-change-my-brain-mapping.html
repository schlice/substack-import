<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [(This is an excerpt from an article on<br>[MedHelp.org(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=07c2f5&url=http://MedHelp.org){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="medhelp.org"}]{.qlink_container}, and it completely answers<br>your question)\<br>\<br>]<br><br>> According to *Taber\'s Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary* (2005),<br>> neuroplasticity is "the ability of the nervous system to adapt to<br>> trauma or disease; the ability of nerve cells to grow and form new<br>> connections to other neurons." Basically, it is the ability of the<br>> brain and nervous system to change in response to experience or<br>> stimuli.\<br>> \<br>> Until recently, the mainstream scientific view was that the adult<br>> human brain couldn't change structurally and that functions were<br>> hardwired in specific areas. So if you had a stroke or lesion or<br>> something that destroyed the functioning of part of your brain, you<br>> might improve a little bit, but on the whole you were just out of<br>> luck.\<br>> \<br>> More recent research has shown that this isn't true. For example,<br>> people who practice the violin a lot develop a larger area of their<br>> brain devoted to mapping the fingers that are used for fingering. For<br>> those of us with MS, this is tremendously exciting because it means<br>> there may be ways to compensate for the damage that MS has done to our<br>> brains and hopefully there will be more research on effective ways to<br>> do this.\<br>> \<br>> In fact, we have probably been benefiting from neuroplasticity and<br>> just didn't know it. In *The Handbook of Multiple Sclerosis*, Kraft<br>> and Shah point out that "clinicians often note a disconnection between<br>> the marked brain atrophy present in an individual patient (implying<br>> significant loss of pre-formed neural pathways) and the ability of<br>> such a patient to function. To function as well as they do, extensive<br>> plasticity---confirmed by imaging studies---has occurred in these<br>> patients" (284). Your brain has probably been compensating for damage<br>> before it become apparent to you or anyone else. Cifelli and Matthews<br>> suggest that "the observation that patterns of functional activation<br>> are altered with movements of even clinically uninvolved limbs,<br>> emphasizes that functionally significant injury may be occurring even<br>> before clinical manifestations, adding to the argument for early<br>> implementation of disease-modifying therapy" (198).\<br>> \<br>> There's a fascinating and accessible book on neuroplasticity called<br>> *The Brain that Changes Itself* by Norman Doidge. The book starts out<br>> with a story of a woman who completely lost the functioning of the<br>> vestibular apparatus in her brain and how she used this special helmet<br>> which detects movement in two planes and sends signals to a strip of<br>> electrodes on her tongue to teach her brain how to perceive balance<br>> again. You can read a little bit about this in the excerpt at<br>> [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/healt\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e9b005&url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/main.jhtml?xml%3D/health/2008/07/26/sm_brain126.xml){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="telegraph.co.uk"}]{.qlink_container}\<br>> \<br>> When I went to physical therapy for walking problems, the physical<br>> therapist determined that much of my balance problem was coming from<br>> the fact that my vestibular apparatus was not communicating with my<br>> brain and thus not contributing to my attempts to stay upright. She<br>> gave me exercises that involved standing on a pillow (to reduce<br>> somatosensory input from the feet) with my eyes closed (to eliminate<br>> visual input) in a safe place. I am then supposed to move my head in<br>> different ways and this is supposed to force my brain to strengthen<br>> and rewire its connections to the vestibular system. And, in fact, my<br>> balance has improved significantly.\<br>> \<br>> Doidge also talks about different types of therapies, such as<br>> constraint-induced movement therapy (CI or CIMT) where stroke victims<br>> go through an intense period of training where they are prevented from<br>> using their good limbs and are forced to use their paralyzed limbs for<br>> various tasks. This can work even with people who have been previously<br>> unable to use the affected limbs for years or decades. Recently, this<br>> type of therapy has also been tried by Mark et al. in people with<br>> progressive MS who "showed overall improvements on all clinical<br>> measures including fatigue"<br>> ([http://www.acceleratedcure(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c60d9c&url=http://www.acceleratedcure){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container}.org:8080/node/3296).\<br>> \<br>> There is also research into the plasticity of cognitive functioning<br>> and ways to improve our ability to learn, process information, and<br>> remember. Doidge looks at the work of Michael Merzenich, a pioneer in<br>> brain plasticity research. Merzenich has created a computer program<br>> that has helped many learning-disabled children improve their auditory<br>> processing of sounds through exercises that increase the speed at<br>> which their auditory cortex neurons fire. This helped the children be<br>> able to read and understand better.\<br>> Merzenich has also been researching how to help older people improve<br>> their mental functioning and has a company called Posit Science<br>> ([http://www.positscience.com(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a2d7ed&url=http://www.positscience.com){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container}) that sells<br>> software to combat the decline of memory, thinking, and processing<br>> speed that commonly comes with aging, but might also help those of us<br>> affected by MS. They sell programs with both auditory and visual<br>> processing exercises.\<br>> \<br>> Posit Science's products are fairly expensive (\$395), but there are a<br>> number of alternatives, including a membership in HAPPYneuron<br>> ([http://www.happy-neuron.com(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=dfaa53&url=http://www.happy-neuron.com){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container}), which provides<br>> access to online games that stimulate your "attention, language,<br>> memory, visual-spatial, and executive function skills." Other options<br>> include CogniFit<br>> ([http://www.cognifit.com(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=80540e&url=http://www.cognifit.com){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container}), Fit Brains<br>> ([http://www.fitbrains.com(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8eb8d1&url=http://www.fitbrains.com){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container}, in beta, but<br>> you can play games online for free), and games for video game<br>> consoles, such as Nintendo Brain Age and Big Brain Academy for the<br>> Wii.\<br>> \<br>> Presumably the ongoing damage to the central nervous system in MS can<br>> eventually reach the limits of neuroplasticity, but finding ways to<br>> make our brains work smarter and more effectively with what we have is<br>> potentially a very fruitful approach.\<br>> \<br>> \<br>> References:\<br>> \<br>> Cifelli, A. and Matthews, P.M.
