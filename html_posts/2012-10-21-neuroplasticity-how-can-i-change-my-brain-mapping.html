> According to *Taber\'s Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary* (2005),
> neuroplasticity is "the ability of the nervous system to adapt to
> trauma or disease; the ability of nerve cells to grow and form new
> connections to other neurons." Basically, it is the ability of the
> brain and nervous system to change in response to experience or
> stimuli.\
> \
> Until recently, the mainstream scientific view was that the adult
> human brain couldn't change structurally and that functions were
> hardwired in specific areas. So if you had a stroke or lesion or
> something that destroyed the functioning of part of your brain, you
> might improve a little bit, but on the whole you were just out of
> luck.\
> \
> More recent research has shown that this isn't true. For example,
> people who practice the violin a lot develop a larger area of their
> brain devoted to mapping the fingers that are used for fingering. For
> those of us with MS, this is tremendously exciting because it means
> there may be ways to compensate for the damage that MS has done to our
> brains and hopefully there will be more research on effective ways to
> do this.\
> \
> In fact, we have probably been benefiting from neuroplasticity and
> just didn't know it. In *The Handbook of Multiple Sclerosis*, Kraft
> and Shah point out that "clinicians often note a disconnection between
> the marked brain atrophy present in an individual patient (implying
> significant loss of pre-formed neural pathways) and the ability of
> such a patient to function. To function as well as they do, extensive
> plasticity---confirmed by imaging studies---has occurred in these
> patients" (284). Your brain has probably been compensating for damage
> before it become apparent to you or anyone else. Cifelli and Matthews
> suggest that "the observation that patterns of functional activation
> are altered with movements of even clinically uninvolved limbs,
> emphasizes that functionally significant injury may be occurring even
> before clinical manifestations, adding to the argument for early
> implementation of disease-modifying therapy" (198).\
> \
> There's a fascinating and accessible book on neuroplasticity called
> *The Brain that Changes Itself* by Norman Doidge. The book starts out
> with a story of a woman who completely lost the functioning of the
> vestibular apparatus in her brain and how she used this special helmet
> which detects movement in two planes and sends signals to a strip of
> electrodes on her tongue to teach her brain how to perceive balance
> again. You can read a little bit about this in the excerpt at

> When I went to physical therapy for walking problems, the physical
> therapist determined that much of my balance problem was coming from
> the fact that my vestibular apparatus was not communicating with my
> brain and thus not contributing to my attempts to stay upright. She
> gave me exercises that involved standing on a pillow (to reduce
> somatosensory input from the feet) with my eyes closed (to eliminate
> visual input) in a safe place. I am then supposed to move my head in
> different ways and this is supposed to force my brain to strengthen
> and rewire its connections to the vestibular system. And, in fact, my
> balance has improved significantly.\

> Doidge also talks about different types of therapies, such as
> constraint-induced movement therapy (CI or CIMT) where stroke victims
> go through an intense period of training where they are prevented from
> using their good limbs and are forced to use their paralyzed limbs for
> various tasks. This can work even with people who have been previously
> unable to use the affected limbs for years or decades. Recently, this
> type of therapy has also been tried by Mark et al. in people with
> progressive MS who "showed overall improvements on all clinical
