So this is what happens when you get your facts from legacy media
outlets who just write stories to try to confuse people who don't
remember civics class.

The Supreme Court isn't the last word because they are always right.
They are always right because they're the last word.

The Court *determines* what is constitutional and what is
unconstitutional. It is the Supreme Court's interpretation of the
Constitution that matters, not what some "constitutional scholar"
(whatever that means) thinks about their decision.

*Their* decision is what *determines* Constitutionality. Everybody else
just has *opinions*. You can agree or disagree, that's the beauty of
opinions. Everyone gets to have their own.

But opinions don't count. SCOTUS does.
