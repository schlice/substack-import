If your Governing Documents state that they can, then legally they can.
What an HOA is allowed to do is completely controlled by the Governing
Documents.

I suggest you engage a real estate attorney in your local area who deals
with HOA law to help you, especially before the issue affects your
credit.

Original question:

Can an HOA fine me \$500 dollars per week for something I cannot legally
fix?
