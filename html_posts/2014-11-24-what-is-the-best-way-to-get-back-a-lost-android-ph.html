**Content:** [You\'re not likely to get it back.\
\
However, your only real chance is to notify your carrier of the theft.
They will flag the IMEI (the phone\'s serial number) in their system,
and anyone trying to re-activate that phone with a new SIM will be
denied, and the phone will be retained until the police arrive.\
\
The carrier will give you a printout showing that the phone has been
flagged stolen and will contain the same IMEI. Take that report to your
local police station and file a stolen property report. If the phone is
activated, the thief can be arrested if he is found in possession of the
phone with the matching IMEI.]{.rendered_qtext}
