*(US Answer Only)*

Depending on where you live, it may not be. This is something which
varies by state. States define for themselves what is considered to be
indecent exposure, and while some states define that as any exposure of
genitalia to anyone who has not affirmatively consented to seeing such
things (i.e. New Jersey), other states define it as only
"sexually-explicit" or "sexually-suggestive" exposure (i.e. Colorado).

But ultimately, the answer to why it is illegal to be nude in your front
yard is **because your state has defined it as indecent exposure**.
