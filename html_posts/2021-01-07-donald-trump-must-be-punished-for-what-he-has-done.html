**Donald Trump must be punished for what he has done. How do we make
sure that happens whether impeached or not?**

When Trump leaves office, he will be a regular (former President)
citizen. If he is not tried for a crime, and **you** want to ensure that
he is "punished," you can punish him in the same way any other
businessman who owns businesses gets punished:

in the wallet.

Don't ever visit a Trump-owned property. Don't go to a Trump-owned
casino. Don't spend money on anything with the Trump name on it (as most
of the real estate with Trump's name on it is done through licensing
agreements). Boycott anything Trump-related, and tell as many people as
you possibly can to do the same. Be sure you know who owns every casino
and property you visit, and avoid Trump properties, despite the fact
that you might want to visit there anyway.
