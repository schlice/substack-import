**I am the victim of a hit and run (fender-bender) but the other
driver's insurance is accepting only 75% liability while citing, "\[I\]
did not take evasive action." What should I do?**

I'm no fan of "ambulance-chaser" attorneys, but in this particular case,
I would absolutely advise you to retain the services of a personal
injury lawyer. You probably have seen their ads on your local TV
channel. They can absolutely help you.

Do not accept any settlement by the insurance company. In fact, stop
talking to them right now, and call a personal injury attorney in your
area.
