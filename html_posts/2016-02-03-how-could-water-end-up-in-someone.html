**Pulmonary Aspiration.**

Pulmonary aspiration is inhaling something into the windpipe that
doesn\'t belong there. When related to eating, it\'s often called
\"going down the wrong pipe.\"

I suppose it could be possible that one could inhale enough mildly
vaporized water to cause some form of appreciable water buildup in the
lungs
