The Bylaws controls how the HOA functions as a non-profit corporation,
along with the Articles of Incorporation. Those documents are necessary
for any corporation; they do not necessarily direct what happens at your
home. They do bind you in certain things, like voting for Directors or
Assessments payments.

What binds you as a homeowner to do or not do certain things is the
Declaration of Covenants (sometimes just called the "covenants" or the
"declaration").

Here's an example from my neighborhood's covenants:

:::: ui_qtext_image_outer
::: qtext_image_wrapper
![](images/qimg-14824387acfbbef74859a02c385873f7){.landscape
.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed
master_src="images/qimg-14824387acfbbef74859a02c385873f7" master_w="852"
master_h="253"}
:::
::::

That's a pretty broad definition of what comprises a "nuisance," isn't
it? And not everything that the Board might consider a "nuisance" is
actually listed there. It also says pretty clearly that the Board has
the authority to determine whether or not something is, or may become, a
nuisance.

The Declaration also usually allows the Board to make other rules and
regulations and update them as they see fit.

:::: ui_qtext_image_outer
::: qtext_image_wrapper
![](images/qimg-4d26d30b021ef9f7897644e616873eb1){.landscape
.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed
master_src="images/qimg-4d26d30b021ef9f7897644e616873eb1" master_w="843"
master_h="132"}

This says that the Board may develop, on their own, a "Rules and
Regulations" document, and you are bound by those rules as well. It also
says the Board can modify this document whenever they choose, but those
changes must be voted in during a Board meeting, which is open to
homeowners.
