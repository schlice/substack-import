**Content:** [You\'re not looking at this from the correct viewpoint.
While these votes tend to be a referendum on the LGBTQ lifestyle,
that\'s not what they should be.\
\
No one has the right to question whether LGBTQ people have the right to
marry. All they have to do is find a church that believes similarly and
they can be married. End of story.\
\
But there\'s this whole thing about \"marriage licenses\" and being
\"recognized under the law as being married.\" The question you need to
answer is: ***why does the government care who you marry?***\
\
If you can answer that question, then you can determine whether or not
you think it\'s right that government be involved in that decision at
all.\
\
The reason this is an issue is because government, for better or for
worse, still holds the belief that children are best raised in a
household with their biological parents.\
\
*Yeah, but what does that have to do with gay marriage?*\
\
The reason government licenses and incentivizes marriage in the first
place is so that adults will structure their lives to best suit the
children that they may produce.\
\
*Yeah, but you still haven\'t answered the question.* ***What does this
have to do with gay marriage?***\
\
Again, for better or worse, the government, knowing that gay couples
cannot produce children, doesn\'t include them in the legislation
surrounding how people should best arrange their lives to support
children.\
\
**THIS IS AN INJUSTICE THAT SHOULD BE CORRECTED!**\
\
Since gay couples can adopt children and raise them, they should be
afforded the same privileges under the law as married couples, because
if we are looking at \"the best interests of the children,\" then we
should give gay couples who adopt a child as much parental support as we
give the biological parents of a child.\
\
There are as many studies that show that children do best when raised by
their biological parents as there are that show that children who grow
up in gay households do as well as their biologically-oriented
counterparts. So I don\'t think relying on studies is going to help us
in this instance.\
\
While we\'re waiting for ***that one definitive study*** (don\'t hold
your breath), families are not getting equal support from their
government because the structure of their family doesn\'t meet some
government standard.\
\
You can fix that.]{.rendered_qtext}
