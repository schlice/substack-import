**Why is Trump still in office if he\'s doing illegal things?**

The presidency is an elected office. It is an office that has specific
procedures about how someone can be removed from that office.

If the president was actually doing illegal things (for which you have
provided no proof, but let's play Devil's Advocate), the
Constitutionally-mandated procedure is for the House of Representatives
to pass Articles of Impeachment against the President, and for the
Senate to hold a trial after which they can remove him from office.

Once he is removed from office, he can face criminal proceedings for
doing "illegal things."

So why is he still in office? Because Congress hasn't done anything to
remove him from office yet. Maybe that's because there's no evidence
that he's done any "illegal things." I don't know, just a thought.
