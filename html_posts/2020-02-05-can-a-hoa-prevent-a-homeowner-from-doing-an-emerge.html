**Can a HOA prevent a homeowner from doing an emergency roof
replacement? Paperwork has been filed and phone calls attempted. I\'m
only receiving an automated response that they have 45 days to respond.
Nothing is changing on the roof.**

Ultimately, HOA rules require that you get approval before every change.

Can the HOA *physically prevent* you from doing an emergency roof
replacement? No, they cannot. They cannot prevent a contractor from
coming to your house, which you own, and repairing your roof.

However, if you do not follow HOA rules and get approval before work
commences, you can still be fined for that violation. It could be a
one-time fine for failing to get approval before commencing work (if
your HOA has such an offense). Or, if you do the work without approval
and it is wrong (i.e. your roofer puts the wrong color roofing tile on
the roof), the HOA can fine you for *every day that your roof is out of
compliance*.
