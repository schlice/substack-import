**Should the current administration be facilitating the espousement of
one religion in the US when there are hundreds of others that do not
receive equal time, since we are all equal under the constitution?**

First of all, we are not all equal under the Constitution. Actually, it
was a few other documents which discussed the fact that we are equal:

- the Declaration of Independence states, "We hold these truths to be
  self-evident, that **all men are created equal**, that they are
  endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among
  these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."
- the Gettysburg Address stated, "Four score and seven years ago, our
  fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in
  liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that **all men are created
  equal.**"

Unless you didn't catch the subtlety there, Lincoln and Jefferson both
said that we are all **created** equal, and Jefferson went on to say
that we are endowed by our (big C) Creator with unalienable rights.
Sounds vaguely religious to me, but whatever.

As far as the Constitution is concerned, the 14th Amendment states that
laws must be applied equally to all people. Besides that, nothing in the
Constitution requires the government to treat everyone equally. At least
I hope not. The government executed Ted Bundy. I don't want to be
treated as equally as he was, and if the government was required to
treat everyone equally, they'd have to electrocute everyone in order to
treat everyone equally. Be careful what you wish for.

You're kinda confusing a lot of topics, and one of them is the First
Amendment. It simply states that the government cannot create a state
religion. Allowing someone to use their free speech rights (also in the
First Amendment) does not amount to the government creating a state
religion. And there's no requirement for the government to give "equal
time" to every religion. The government cannot discriminate because of
religion, but there is no equal time requirement either.
