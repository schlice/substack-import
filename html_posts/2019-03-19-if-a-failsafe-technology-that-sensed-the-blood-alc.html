**If a failsafe technology that sensed the blood alcohol content of the
person sitting in the driver\'s seat of a vehicle which would render the
vehicle disabled were available, would you support it being a
requirement in all vehicles? Why or why not?**

If at all possible, I'd want manufacturers to make it standard equipment
in all vehicles *without the government needing to make it required.*
And I wouldn't want it to disable the vehicle. I'd want it to notify the
driver and any passengers that the driver may be impaired and someone
else should probably drive. I'd want the passengers in the car to agree
to allow the driver to proceed (assuming there were other passengers in
the car). Instead of disabling the car, I'd rather have the car "narc"
to the police that someone impaired may be operating, have the police
stop the vehicle, and deal with the driver directly.

Of course, part of the problem here is that there is no standard for BAC
across the country, and different states have different requirements, so
the vehicle would have to know not only what state it was in, but it
would also have to know the laws in that state, and disable the vehicle
if the laws of that state were violated.

You also said that the technology would have to be "failsafe." I agree;
it would have to never produce false positives, ever. Even if I've had
cough syrup, it still can't incorrectly determine that I've been
drinking.
