**Content:** [We have a national DNA database called CODIS (Consolidated
DNA Identification System). It receives input from the following
sources:\

- convicted offenders
- arrestees
- legal detainees
- forensic casework
- unidentified human remains
- missing persons
- relatives of missing persons

Also, if you are a member of the military, the Department of Defense
will maintain your DNA on file so that your remains can be identified by
DNA analysis if your remains are damaged beyond physical recognition.\
\
It\'s not likely that we will ever have a complete record of DNA
profiles for everyone, as it is likely to be an invasion of privacy.
