**Should society tell police to never go \"hands on\" with a suspect as
the monetary cost could be too high if they (the cop) were hurt?**

So let me see if I understand this question. You're saying that police
should never use force with a suspect because the medical costs would be
too high if the officer is injured?

Placing a person under arrest always involves application of some level
of force. Applying handcuffs is "restraining" a citizen, which is a
forceful activity.

Unless you never want the police to arrest anyone, you can't tell the
police to never use any level of force against a suspect.

Therefore, any injuries must be expected, and paid for.
