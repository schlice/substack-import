**Is it legal for an employer to verify the validity of a doctors note
provided by an employee?**

It does not violate HIPAA for an employer to verify that a doctor
actually wrote a doctor's note purported to be from that doctor.

The employer can call the doctor's office and ask the doctor whether or
not he wrote the note in question. That's all they can ask. They can't
ask about any other protected medical questions. But it is legal for the
employer to verify with the doctor that they actually wrote the note.
