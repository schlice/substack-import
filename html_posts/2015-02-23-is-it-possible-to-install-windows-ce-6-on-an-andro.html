**Content:** [Most Android tablets use ARM-based processors that do not
support Windows. You could install Windows CE on an X86 (Intel) or
AMD-based tablet, but since most tablets and smartphones use ARM
processors, you cannot install Windows CE.\
\
Windows 8 RT will support ARM-based architectures (if you can find it),
but that\'s about it.\
\
You should look for a tablet with an Intel-based processor. That way,
you could run Windows and Android using a dual-boot
setup.]{.rendered_qtext}
