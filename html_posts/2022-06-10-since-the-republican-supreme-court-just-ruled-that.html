There's so much wrong with this question, I don't even know where to
start.

1.  It's not a "Republican Supreme Court." It's a "traditionalist"
    Supreme Court. Traditionalist members of the Court interpret the
    Constitution as it is written, based on the understanding when it
    was written. Their view is that the Constitution is an unchanging
    document, unless you go through the process to change it.
2.  They didn't "rule" that Federal authorities can search your house in
    the Border Enforcement Zone. Federal agents have always been able to
    do that.
3.  What they were *actually* looking at in that case was an excessive
    force claim, and they found that *Bivens v. Six Unknown Federal
    Agents* was wrongly decided, and Border Patrol agents are not
    subject to lawsuits for punitive or compensatory damages.
4.  Republicans do care about the Constitution, but the Constitution
    doesn't say anything about Border Patrol agents or filing lawsuits
    against Border Patrol agents. So it's not really relevant.

Just a terrible question all around.

Original question:

Since the republican supreme court just ruled that federal authorities
can search your house, if you are 100 miles from the border, without
warrant, is it safe to say that republicans don\'t actually care about
the constitution?
