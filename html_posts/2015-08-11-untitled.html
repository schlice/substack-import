<h2>Answer Comment</h2>
<div>

**Content:** [However, even auto-drive cars will have to have a viable
driver behind the wheel. Whether or not the computer is driving, the
driver must be coherent enough to operate the vehicle and take over from
the computer when its driving becomes unsafe. You still can\'t do that
if you are under the influence.\
\
It will definitely take more creative policing to determine if someone
is DUI. The point here is that even if the computer is driving, the
person sitting behind the wheel is still the operator of the vehicle,
not the computer.\
\
I agree that it will become harder to determine whether someone is DUI
if the computer is driving.]{.rendered_qtext}
