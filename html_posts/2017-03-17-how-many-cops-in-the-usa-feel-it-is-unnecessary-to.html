I want to pass on an answer by [[R. Justin
Freeman](https://www.quora.com/profile/R-Justin-Freeman)]{.qlink_container}
that I read several years ago. It explains ***exactly*** why some police
officers may not want to criminally charge a marijuana user. Please read
this answer:

[[R. Justin Freeman\'s answer to What do police officers think about
legalizing drugs? Would it make their jobs harder or
easier?](https://www.quora.com/What-do-police-officers-think-about-legalizing-drugs-Would-it-make-their-jobs-harder-or-easier/answer/R-Justin-Freeman)]{.qlink_container}

**TL;DR:** Marijuana and *all other drugs* are in two totally different
universes. It's a *massive* time sink to arrest and process your average
pot head. If there was a way to get that pot head some help, that would
be useful. The problem we have is we treat addicts like criminals
instead of like patients. But because the medical establishment has not
seen fit to call addiction a disease, then addicts must simply be people
making bad choices, which leaves it up to law enforcement to handle.
This overcrowds the jails with people who should never be there. They
should be getting medical help, not arrest records.

So if an officer's discretion sneaks in when a kid gets caught with a
joint, and the officer just returns the kid home and gives the parents a
good tongue-lashing, I think you'll find many officers who personally
agree with that decision.
