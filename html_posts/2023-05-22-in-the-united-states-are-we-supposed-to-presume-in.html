Yes, because probable cause or reasonable suspicion do not equal guilt.
Guilt is only determined by a competent court of appropriate
jurisdiction.

This does not mean that we do not have evidence that you committed a
crime. It also doesn't mean we don't have probable cause to believe that
the evidence points to you being the one who committed the crime. Those
are all exactly what they seem: evidence of a crime, and evidence that
you are the person who committed the crime.

But even with evidence (which may provide probable cause to effect an
arrest), you are still considered innocent until proven guilty in court.
This allows for the due process you are guaranteed under the 5th and
14th Amendments of the Constitution.
