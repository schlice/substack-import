It is not necessary to turn off mobile data when your phone connects to
Wi-Fi. Your device will automatically use Wi-Fi when it is on and
connected.

Even better, "Adaptive Wi-Fi" is included on most modern Samsung phones.
Previously known as Smart Network switching, enabling the Adaptive Wi-Fi
feature allows your network to automatically switch between Wi-Fi and
mobile data automatically to maintain a stable network connection.

- If your Wi-Fi signal becomes weak or unreliable, your phone will
  switch to mobile data automatically.
- Wi-Fi will turn on automatically when you\'re within range of Wi-Fi
  networks you use frequently.

This will not only keep you on the fastest connection available, it will
also save battery by turning off Wi-Fi when you don't need it.
