<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I think I need to address this question. The fundamental<br>premise of your question stems from the belief that the military is in<br>place to \"protect Americans\" and \"to keep Americans safer.\" In a<br>sense, that is what we do, but in actuality, based on Constitutional<br>dictate, we do not protect Americans.\<br>\<br>WHAT??????\<br>\<br>Yes, it\'s true. We are not the United States Police Department. We do<br>not \"protect and serve,\" unless you are talking about the<br>Constitution. When any of the members of the Armed Forces raises their<br>right hands and swears an oath, it is to \"support and defend the<br>Constitution.\" Let me repeat for you the oath of office for US Armed<br>Forces officers:\<br>\<br>\"I, \<name\>, having been appointed a \<rank\> in the \<branch of<br>service\>, do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the<br>Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and<br>domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same, that I<br>take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose<br>of evasion, and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of<br>the office upon which I am about to enter, so help me God.\"\<br>\<br>So does this mean that we support and defend a piece of paper? Hardly.<br>This means that we guard our country and, more importantly, our way of<br>life. That is an important distinction to make. If you feel that the<br>Armed Forces is nothing more than the United States Police Department,<br>some of the things you see politicians doing with the military would<br>seem wrong.\<br>\<br>The US military does not work within the borders of the United States.<br>The Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, in effect, prohibits the military from<br>enforcing state laws. The Act (and it\'s amendments) specifically<br>authorize other federal agencies, like the National Guard and the Coast<br>Guard, to enforce certain federal laws when being used in that capacity.<br>The US military is specifically prohibited from such enforcement<br>activities. This was borne from the Framer\'s fears that the new<br>government would get too powerful and turn its military inward against<br>its own people. So in this regard, the military does not specifically<br>protect people, per se. The military makes it so you can live life in<br>this country without threat to your liberty. The founding fathers made<br>you free; the military keeps you free.\<br>\<br>Therefore, you need to view everything that the military does through<br>the lens of defending our way of life. Does a peacekeeping role in<br>Bosnia keep you free? Does deposing a dictator in Iraq keep you free?<br>Does containing the spread of Communism keep you free? If you can say<br>that any of those activities, left unchecked, could pose a danger to<br>your liberty and way of life, then the \"force projection\" provided by<br>your military is Constitutionally supported, and necessary for the<br>safety and continuity of a free people.\<br>\<br>Ensure that you view military activities through that lens. Also<br>understand that you will not know the extent of the threat posed by<br>hostile forces; much of that information is classified, because its<br>release could also cause grave damage to the security of the United<br>States. Finally, individual Congressmen or Senators or Presidents even,<br>do not make decisions in a vacuum. Their every move is viewed, reviewed,<br>and reported on in after-action reports, so that if there was an abuse,<br>it could be caught and rectified. Does that mean that it doesn\'t<br>happen? Of course not. This is because as hard as we try, the system is<br>still run by fallible human beings, and Groupthink along with other<br>dangerous activities can undermine even the most stringent operational<br>controls.\<br>\<br>While military members want every individual citizen back home to be<br>safe, they know that their actions will eventually lead to the nation as<br>a whole being a safer place to live, a place where freedom can endure<br>because of their actions.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
