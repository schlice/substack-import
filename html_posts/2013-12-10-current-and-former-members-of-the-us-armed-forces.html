**Content:** [I think I need to address this question. The fundamental
premise of your question stems from the belief that the military is in
place to \"protect Americans\" and \"to keep Americans safer.\" In a
sense, that is what we do, but in actuality, based on Constitutional
dictate, we do not protect Americans.\
\
WHAT??????\
\
Yes, it\'s true. We are not the United States Police Department. We do
not \"protect and serve,\" unless you are talking about the
Constitution. When any of the members of the Armed Forces raises their
right hands and swears an oath, it is to \"support and defend the
Constitution.\" Let me repeat for you the oath of office for US Armed
Forces officers:\
\
\"I, \<name\>, having been appointed a \<rank\> in the \<branch of
service\>, do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the
Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and
domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same, that I
take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose
of evasion, and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of
the office upon which I am about to enter, so help me God.\"\
\
So does this mean that we support and defend a piece of paper? Hardly.
This means that we guard our country and, more importantly, our way of
life. That is an important distinction to make. If you feel that the
Armed Forces is nothing more than the United States Police Department,
some of the things you see politicians doing with the military would
seem wrong.\
\
The US military does not work within the borders of the United States.
The Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, in effect, prohibits the military from
enforcing state laws. The Act (and it\'s amendments) specifically
authorize other federal agencies, like the National Guard and the Coast
Guard, to enforce certain federal laws when being used in that capacity.
The US military is specifically prohibited from such enforcement
activities. This was borne from the Framer\'s fears that the new
government would get too powerful and turn its military inward against
its own people. So in this regard, the military does not specifically
protect people, per se. The military makes it so you can live life in
this country without threat to your liberty. The founding fathers made
you free; the military keeps you free.\
\
Therefore, you need to view everything that the military does through
the lens of defending our way of life. Does a peacekeeping role in
Bosnia keep you free? Does deposing a dictator in Iraq keep you free?
Does containing the spread of Communism keep you free? If you can say
that any of those activities, left unchecked, could pose a danger to
your liberty and way of life, then the \"force projection\" provided by
your military is Constitutionally supported, and necessary for the
safety and continuity of a free people.\
\
Ensure that you view military activities through that lens. Also
understand that you will not know the extent of the threat posed by
hostile forces; much of that information is classified, because its
release could also cause grave damage to the security of the United
States. Finally, individual Congressmen or Senators or Presidents even,
do not make decisions in a vacuum. Their every move is viewed, reviewed,
and reported on in after-action reports, so that if there was an abuse,
it could be caught and rectified. Does that mean that it doesn\'t
happen? Of course not. This is because as hard as we try, the system is
still run by fallible human beings, and Groupthink along with other
dangerous activities can undermine even the most stringent operational
controls.\
\
While military members want every individual citizen back home to be
safe, they know that their actions will eventually lead to the nation as
a whole being a safer place to live, a place where freedom can endure
because of their actions.]{.rendered_qtext}
