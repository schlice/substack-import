If your goal is to stop mass shootings like what happened in Orlando,
and the method by which you intend on going about this is to implement
"sensible change," you can just stop right now.

*But there has to be a way to stop these people from doing mass
shootings!*

The short answer is, there is none. Because you're focusing on the wrong
problem.

You are looking at the incident in Orlando and, like the political left
in the United States, are focused on the gun. *If we could just get rid
of the gun,* they think, *we will stop mass shootings*.

This line of logic is wrong for many reasons, but primarily this:
*making something illegal doesn't make it go away*. We have spent
decades making things illegal in the United States and they are a bigger
problem now than when we enacted the laws in the first place. See [[War
on
Drugs](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c9df4b&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Drugs){.external_link

[[Prohibition](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=21a286&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} for starters. Making
these things illegal didn't make people stop doing them or using them,
and it certainly didn't make them go away. What makes you think that
prohibiting guns in the same way will somehow be different?

The problem is that *laws can't change human behavior*. Laws only
influence people who *choose to be bound by law.* For example, if I'm an
upstanding, law-abiding person, I will probably stop doing something if
the government makes it illegal. If they outlawed right turns on red
tomorrow because people were getting killed, I would stop turning right
on red. I *chose* to follow the law; many people choose, intentionally,
to not follow the law. The law itself does not change human behavior. It
oftentimes influences behavior, but you cannot legislate morality. If
someone chooses to violate the law, they are going to continue to
violate the law. You can write as many laws as you choose, and they will
continue to violate the law.

If you repeal the Second Amendment and make guns illegal, millions of
legal gun owners in the United States will have a choice: will I follow
the law, or will I consciously become a criminal, simply by possessing a
firearm? I suspect you will find many people able to justify that
position as a criminal because that's how they were raised, and that's
what they know. In the future, you'll find fewer people who will
consciously violate the law, but they will exist.
