You asked a "should" question, which is you asking for personal opinion.

I'll get to the opinion in just a minute.

Just in case you meant to ask the *fact* question of whether or not they
will face criminal charges and/or be required to register as sex
offenders, the answer to that is "it depends" and it depends on where
the crime was committed. Some states hold both youths responsible for
child pornography charges. Some hold just one responsible, and some hold
neither of them responsible.

Now, as for whether or not they *should* face criminal charges, I do not
believe so. They should face consequences in the *juvenile justice
system*, which focuses on rehabilitation and counseling, not just for
the children, but for their caregivers. If children are sending each
other nudes, there are deeper issues in both of their families which
need to be addressed. The adult criminal justice system does not
adequately address them, but the juvenile justice system does.

They absolutely should not be registering as sex offenders. They're
barely old enough to understand what sex is. They're not likely old
enough to understand the ramifications of sex, or the psychological
impact of sex. Because they lack the cognitive ability to understand the
deeper implications of sex, I don't think they even *qualify* as "sex
offenders." They're simply misguided youth who need a lot of counseling
and therapy. Hopefully they get it before they become adults.
