The Bible tells us what it sounds like.

It was recorded in Acts 2, after the apostles were given the gift of the
Holy Spirit. The apostles shared the gospel with the crowds, speaking to
them in their own languages. The crowds were amazed: "We hear them
declaring the wonders of God in our own tongues!" (Acts 2:11). The Greek
word translated "tongues" literally means "languages." Therefore, the
gift of tongues is speaking in a language the speaker has never learned
in order to minister to someone who does speak that language.

Imagine this: a room full of people from all over the world. Spanish,
French, German, Russian, Korean, Japanese, Polish, Nordic people, all
represented in the room. Then one person gets up and starts speaking.
***But everyone, from every country, could understand what he was
saying, in his own native language.***

**This** is what "speaking in tongues" looks like. It means speaking in
languages that the speaker never learned to communicate God's Word to
people who do not speak their language.

Anything else that you may have heard of being related to speaking in
tongues is nonsense and is unbiblical. Incoherent babble is exactly
that: *incoherent*. Speaking in tongues was speaking in a language that
everyone could understand. If you hear something and you don't
understand it, you are not hearing speaking in tongues.
