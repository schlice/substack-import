Christians today are not hopeful that he's right about homosexuals or
ignorant about their own sin, because Christians today know that
everyone is a sinner, and all sins are forgivable. If you read on just a
little bit into 1 Cor 6:11, you find that those identifying labels are
removed when a person comes to faith in Christ and is declared righteous
by God.

> *And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified,
> you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the
> Spirit of our God. \-- 1 Corinthians 6:11 ESV*

Paul is saying here that a person forgiven in Christ defines those sins
as \"past tense.\" They do not define who they are, or who they will be.
Some of them *used to be* known by these labels because of their sin.
But that is not who they are any longer. Now, they are in Christ. So
even the people identified in verse 9 can be forgiven. **None of these
sins** ***disqualify*** **you from salvation** ***permanently*.**

There was only one unforgivable sin, and it could only be committed in
the presence of Jesus while He was performing miracles. Since Jesus is
not physically in our presence today, we can't commit that unforgivable
sin. This means that any sin we can commit can be forgiven in Christ.

For those who are in Christ, all sin is covered. All sin debt is paid by
Christ's sacrifice.
