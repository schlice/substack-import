In the US, there is no standard for a "minimum" amount of time an
employer is required to pay an hourly employee who reports to work but
then is told to leave. There are state standards for minimum work time
for hourly employees, but they vary by state. For example, some states
like California say that if you are an hourly worker who comes in
expecting to work eight hours and you work less than half of the usual
time (or the scheduled time), the employer is required to pay half of
the usual hours. California calls this "reporting time."

There are some instances in which the employer doesn't have to pay
reporting time:

1.  When the employer\'s operations cannot begin or continue due to
    threats to employees or property, or when civil authorities
    recommend that work not begin or continue.
2.  When public utilities fail to supply electricity, water, or gas, or
    there is a failure in the public utilities, or sewer system.
3.  When the interruption of work is caused by an Act of God or other
    cause not within the employer\'s control, for example, an
    earthquake.
4.  If the employee is not fit to work.
5.  If the employee has not reported to work on time and is fired or
    sent home as a disciplinary action.
6.  If an unexpected or unusual occurrence during off hours makes it
    impossible for the employer to open for business and the employer
    has made every reasonable effort to notify employees not to report
    for work.

Call your local Office of Labor Standards in your state, or you can also
call the [[Wage and Hour
division](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7f4ee4&url=https://www.dol.gov/whd/america2.htm){.external_link

Failing that, hiring a good labor attorney would be a great thing to do.

In the meantime, use your down time to find another job. When they ask
you why you want to leave your old job, it's easy enough to tell them
you're not getting enough hours at your old job.
