First of all, you\'re reading mainstream media liberal lies. These guys
have absolutely no idea whether or not Trump has actually "given up" on
having Mexico pay for the border wall.

they probably believe that the only way to pay for a border wall Is to
do so up front. However, Trump has already explained how Mexico will pay
for the border wall:

> *Mexico must pay for the wall and, until they do, the United States
> will, among other things: impound all remittance payments derived from
> illegal wages; increase fees on all temporary visas issued to Mexican
> CEOs and diplomats (and if necessary cancel them); increase fees on
> all border crossing cards of which we issue about 1 million to Mexican
> nationals each year (a major source of visa overstays); increase fees
> on all NAFTA worker visas from Mexico (another major source of
> overstays); and increase fees at ports of entry to the United States
> from Mexico \[Tariffs and foreign aid cuts are also options\]. We will
> not be taken advantage of anymore.*
