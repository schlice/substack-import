Let's clarify a little.

Epidemiological studies have shown that you take on the risk of the new
region in *your* lifetime if you move to that region before age 15. The
new risk will be seen in the *next generation* if you move to the region
beyond age 15.

This may mean that by the time you turn 15, the risk factors for
developing MS are already fixed in your body. Either you have them and
are at higher risk, or you don't and you are at lower risk. Don't forget
that people primarily develop MS between ages 20 and 50.

Geographically-speaking, this age also correlates very closely with the
age at which increased levels of Vitamin D no longer provide significant
prophylaxis against MS. In other words, you needed significant Vitamin D
levels before age 16 for it to provide some prophylaxis against the
disease. So it's possible that there could be a correlation between
where you grow up and how much Vitamin D is generated by your skin in
that region. This has yet to be confirmed, though.
