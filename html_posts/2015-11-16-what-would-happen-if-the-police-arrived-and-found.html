The police arrive and attempt to take control of the situation. They
arrive, announce their presence, and what *should* happen is the \"good
guys\" should stop shooting, immediately drop their weapons, and get on
the ground in a position of disadvantage. Anyone still standing with a
gun becomes not a *good guy*, not a *bad guy,* but a
**target**.]{.rendered_qtext}
