*"Hell yes, we're going to take away your AR-15s, your AK-47s." ---
Robert Francis "Beto" O'Rourke, Democratic Presidential Candidate*

Why do some people think gun reform is going to take away our right to
have guns?

Because they very plainly and emphatically said that's exactly what they
want to do. And were met with thunderous applause by the millions of
Democrats who believe similarly that if you ban honest citizens from
owning guns that criminals will somehow choose to change their behavior.

It has never worked at any time in human history, and there is exactly
zero evidence that it will work today. People who argue for the banning
of arms ask for automatic rule by the young, the strong, and the many,
and that\'s the exact opposite of a civilized society. A mugger, even an
armed one, can only make a successful living in a society where *the
state has granted him a force monopoly.*
