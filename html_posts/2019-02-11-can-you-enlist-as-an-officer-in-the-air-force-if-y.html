You cannot "enlist" as an officer.

There are four paths to becoming an officer in the United States Air
Force:

- Graduate from the US Air Force Academy (USAFA)
- Attend Officer Training School (OTS) after getting your Bachelor's
  Degree
- Attend AFROTC in college
- Enlist as an Airman and work towards becoming an officer

As you can see, you need at least a Bachelor's Degree to become an
officer. With the exception of OTS, you can get your Bachelor's Degree
while you train to be a military officer. If you go the OTS path, it's
because you already have your Bachelor's Degree.
