[[Josh

absolutely right.

I assume you\'re talking about **aspartame**, the artificial sweetner
used in many diet soft drinks. No other consumable substance on the face
of the earth has been studied more than aspartame. Over 30 years and
over 200 peer-reviewed, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and randomized
scientific studies have proven, re-proven, and reaffirmed, that
aspartame is safe.

Researchers have spent a great deal of time reviewing every claim by
people who believe that aspartame causes everything from MS and autism
to migraines and bulging eyes. Not a single claim of any cause has
panned out under true scientific scrutiny. If you do have \"proof\" that
aspartame causes any sort of disorder, look through your proof and see
if there are any scientific studies that were done. Scientific studies
are peer-reviewed, randomized, placebo-controlled, and double-blind.
Those tenets of a true scientific study ensure that there is no bias in
the group and that the substance is tested against a \"placebo,\" or a
control substance. In essence, if there is no difference between the
group which took the tested substance and the group which took a
placebo, you can say that the substance did not appreciably contribute
to those people developing the symptom in question.

Now, to more of the scientific detail. Aspartame is a compound made of
two ingredients: aspartic acid, and phenylalanine. When aspartame is
consumed, it is broken down in the body into three components: aspartic
acid, phenylalanine, and methanol. These three substances are then
absorbed by the body and used in natural body processes, the same way
your body uses those three substances when they are derived from food.
None of the components of aspartame, nor aspartame itself, builds up in
the body. The amounts of the three substances derived from aspartame are
far smaller than you would get from food as well. For example, if you
were to have a glass of tomato juice, you\'d get about six times the
methanol than you\'d get from an aspartame-sweetened drink of roughly
the same size. A glass of skim milk would give you six times the
phenylalanine and thirteen times the aspartic acid you\'d get from an
equivalent aspartame-sweetened drink.

There is a sensitivity that is out there which could be triggered by
aspartame. It\'s called \"phenylketonuria,\" also known as PKU. This
condition is an inability to metabolize phenylalanine in the body into
the amino acid tyrosine. For these people, phenylalanine accumulates and
is converted into phenylpyruvate, also known as phenylketone. This
buildup of phenylketone in the body can lead to serious medical
problems, like seizures and mental retardation. Since PKU is a genetic
disorder, there is no cure, and the only treatment option currently
available is a strict diet restricting anything with phenylalanine, or
anything that can break down into phenylalanine. So anything made with
aspartame has a warning on the label: \"PHENYLKETONURICS: CONTAINS
PHENYLALANINE\".

Let me caution you: don\'t take my word for it. Don\'t take anyone
else\'s word for it either. Do the work yourself; look it up yourself.
But when you read the websites that tell you all the diseases that
aspartame \"causes,\" look for the proof. Look for the true scientific
studies, and then go look those studies up yourself. Do they exist? Were
they done to scientific standards? Were the results duplicated in other
studies? Were the results published in any scientific journals so that
the scientific community in general could review and analyze the
results? Did a doctor see this in 150 of his patients? That\'s not a
scientific study. Was a study done on all the people in the Memphis area
who drank Diet Coke? Also not a scientific study. The actual scientific
studies that are out there prove that the substance is safe. The CDC
researched 517 of these claims in 1984, and reported the following:
\"\[T\]he majority of frequently reported symptoms were mild and are
symptoms that are common in the general populace.\" This means that
there is no greater risk of any of these symptoms in someone who
consumes aspartame as there is in the general population in people who
do not consume aspartame.
