Even if the Supreme Court rules that the 2020 Presidential election was
100% rigged, we won't have a 2021 election.

The election took place. 50 states and the District of Columbia all had
separate elections, and they all certified their results. Congress
accepted the certified results of the election, and power transferred
hands peacefully, as it has done for over 200 years.

Since the election was held Constitutionally, the results are permanent.

If we find concrete evidence that a state's election results were so
badly rigged **that it would have changed the outcome of the election,**
then some very pointed looks at that state will start to take place. How
were they able to *certify* a state's results with such widespread
election tampering? People will be fired. Election processes will be
changed. The specific avenues which permitted election tampering will be
modified so that they can no longer cause such tampering.

Some very unusual things happened in the 2020 Presidential election,
things that hopefully, are being modified by the states to prevent from
occurring in the future.
