So let's do this a little bit at a time:

> I cannot sell my home without paying \$90,000 commission.

Untrue. You can't sell your home *if you use a Realtor* without paying
commission. But if you use a Realtor, that person is going to want to be
paid. So assuming that you're paying 6% commission, you are selling a
\$1.5 million house. In order to effectively market your home and get
the highest possible offer, you're going to want to *list it for sale on
the Multiple Listing Service (MLS)*. This is a database of all homes for
sale in the United States. The MLS is a product of the National
Association of Realtors. Listing your house, marketing your house
properly, getting the word out about your house, making sure the
showings are taken care of, are *services* which get paid for out of the
sale of your house, when you use a Realtor.

Of course! Instead of using a Realtor and listing your house on the MLS,
you can just stick a sign on the lawn that says "For Sale By Owner" and
then sign a contract with someone who can pay for your house.

Sure! Except the people who run that website will need to pay their
programmers and pay for the website and all of that stuff and they're
going to want to get paid somehow.

Or you can use the growing list of non-MLS listing services which
already exist. Some examples (there are more than this, try Google):

- [[Rocket
  Homes](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cb3b2a&url=https://www.rockethomes.com/){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
  qt-tooltip="rockethomes.com"}]{.qlink_container}, from the same people
  who brought you Rocket Mortgage
- [[Offerpad](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d2f0b4&url=https://www.offerpad.com/){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
  qt-tooltip="offerpad.com"}]{.qlink_container}

Or sell your home to the growing list of "all-cash" buyers. Some
examples (there are more than this, Google is your friend):

- [[HomeLight](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=005525&url=https://www.homelight.com/simple-sale/quiz%23/qaas%3D0/){.external_link

Original question:

I cannot sell my home without paying \$90,000 commission. Can\'t I just
trade my home with someone from the area I want to live at bypassing the
middleman? Someone should start a business called hometrading .com
