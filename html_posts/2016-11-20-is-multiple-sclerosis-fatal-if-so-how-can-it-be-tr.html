Multiple sclerosis itself is not fatal. Patients can die from
complications caused by MS. For example, you could die from asphyxiation
caused by swallowing difficulties. But the disease itself does not cause
death.

In fact, with modern medications used to treat MS, lifespans of MS
patients nearly equal the lifespans of those without the disease. We
don't know what causes MS so we don't have a cure, but current
medications can slow down the disease progression and lessen its
effects.
