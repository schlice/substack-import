In my last trip to India, I used both a step-down transformer as well as
a plug adapter.

Indian power runs at 220V (as does most of Europe), and India uses
EU-style outlet prongs. Charging your phone may be as simple as just
using a plug adapter if you don't need to step the voltage down to 110.

It is up to you to check your charging "brick" to see if it accepts
220V.

You'll notice my US Samsung charging adapter accepts "100--240V,
50--60Hz", That means I can plug this directly into the wall in India,
and the voltage will be accepted. I'll just need a plug adapter to
convert my US prongs to fit India's outlet prongs.

This is my favorite plug adapter:

[[Amazon.com: Kensington International Grounded 3 Prong Travel Adapter,

Remember though, this is not a transformer. This will simply convert the
prongs between devices. It will still deliver 220V to your device, so
your device must be able to accept 220V to use this alone. My laptop's
power supply also accepted 220, so I was able to plug it directly into
the wall as well with the plug adapter. I use a travel power strip when
I travel, like this one:

[[Amazon.com: FosPower 3-Outlet Mini Power
Strip](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5abf80&url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XDJHXVB){.external_link

I'll plug this into the plug adapter, and then the devices which accept
220 can get plugged into the strip.

Very few of the devices I bring with me internationally can't accept
220, but **if your device only accepts 110V,** you will have to plug
into a **step-down transformer** in order to convert the voltage to
110V. This is the one I use:

[[Amazon.com: Simran SMF-200 Deluxe 200 Watts Step Down Voltage
Converter](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2724e5&url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W9DJ1Q){.external_link

This device will step the voltage down from 220 to 110 if you have
devices which do not accept more than 110V. My electric razor and my
electric toothbrush did not accept 220, but the hotel I was staying in
conveniently had a US 110 plug near the bathroom sink for electric
devices like toothbrushes and razors.
