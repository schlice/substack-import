It was already tried, and was already ruled unconstitutional. In 1993,
the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan from New York proposed a
10,000% tax on ammunition.

The court ruled that ammunition is an essential part of a firearm, and
that taxing it this way violates the Second Amendment by
disproportionately affecting the poor, therefore denying them their
rights under the Second Amendment.

Trying to find creative ways to deny firearms to people is exactly why
we have a Second Amendment.

Original question:

Now that the Supreme Court has decided that Citizens no longer need to
demonstrate a need to apply for a weapons carry permit, should we
consider Chris Rock\'s proposal to tax bullets at \$500 each (except for
\<=.22 LR, at firing ranges and gun clubs)?
