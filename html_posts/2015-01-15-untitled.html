<h2>Answer Comment</h2>
<div>

**Content:** [In my opinion, the \"average\" gun rights enthusiast has
been to the range at least once in his life and has a fair idea how well
he is able to aim and fire and make the lead go where you tell it to
go.\
\
As far as what you will do when the pressure is on, no one can really
know exactly how they will respond until the pressure is really on. He
may be BMOC (big man on campus) now, but when the bad guys actually
brandish weapons, he may turn into a blubbering gelatinous mass of
quivering weakness. You can train all you want, but until the fit hits
the shan for real, you never know how someone will actually
respond.]{.rendered_qtext}
