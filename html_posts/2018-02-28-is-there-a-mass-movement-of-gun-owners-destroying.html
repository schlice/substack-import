**Is there a mass movement of gun owners destroying their guns and
denouncing the second amendment on moral principle after this year\'s
Florida school shooting, or is the guy in the video just a one-off?**

I would like to announce a new service. I will accept all of your guns
and will gladly "destroy" them for you. Just send them to me, and I'll
take care of everything. No messy "destroying." No potential issues with
inadvertently creating a "short-barreled shotgun" and running afoul of
Federal law. Just find yourself an FFL and send your unwanted guns to
me. I'll be happy to take care of them for you!

Best of all, I'll do it all for ***FREE!!!***

Just e-mail me and I'll take care of the rest.

Limited time offer! Act now before this great deal passes you by!
