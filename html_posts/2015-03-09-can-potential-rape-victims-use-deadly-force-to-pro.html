You are right, current laws don\'t adequately lay out the basis for the
use of deadly force against an attacker who doesn\'t present a
life-threatening position, but only presents a position of forcible or
unwanted sexual intercourse. But I think you can make the case for the
use of deadly force to stop a rape.

In order to be legally justified to kill an attacker, a victim has to be
in fear for her life. In a rape, a victim has to reasonably believe that
a rapist intends to kill or grievously injure her in order to use deadly
force against him.

(EDIT) As my commenters always helpfully remind me when I make a
mistake, I forgot to make abundantly clear that in most states, the
legal standard to use deadly force is "imminent threat of death **or
great bodily harm**." It is pretty clear that a forcible rape would
squarely fall into the second category.

There are lots of things to consider that may happen during rapes. Rapes
often end in murder or in serious physical injury, so a victim can
reasonably assume that her life and health would be in serious danger.
Additionally, rapes often include physical trauma, unwanted pregnancy,
and other possible side effects (mental instability, STDs, etc). Under
objective review, rape can universally be considered a grievous physical
and psychological attack.

Using that standard, a victim can resist a rape using any force at her
disposal, up to and including deadly force.
