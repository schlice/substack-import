It *would* be illegal *if* you explicitly denied permission to show your
online status and Facebook did it anyway. At the very least it would be
a privacy violation.

If you never explicitly denied permission to show your online status,
Facebook includes that as part of their Terms of Service, so signing up
for Facebook and accepting the ToS and the User Agreement implies
consent to showing your online status unless you specifically opt-out of
that feature.
