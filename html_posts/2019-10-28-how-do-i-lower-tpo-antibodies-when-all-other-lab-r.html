**How do I lower TPO antibodies when all other lab results are normal?**

The short answer is: you don't, because it's likely that TPO antibodies
are not your biggest problem.

Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies are a marker for the presence of
autoimmune thyroid disease. Blood test results for TPO antibodies [[are
positive in 95% of
patients](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6516b3&url=https://www.mdedge.com/clinicianreviews/article/72387/endocrinology/thyroid-peroxidase-antibodies){.external_link

thyroiditis, also known as *Hashimoto's disease*, and in 50% to 80% of
patients with Graves' disease.

Hashimoto\'s disease often leads to an underactive thyroid gland, a
condition known as *hypothyroidism*. Symptoms of an underactive thyroid
include feeling tired, feeling cold when others do not, constipation,
weight gain, and heavier-than-normal menstrual periods. Not all patients
with Hashimoto's disease develop hypothyroidism.

Graves\' disease is an immune system disorder that results in the
overproduction of thyroid hormones, also known as *hyperthyroidism*.
Although a number of disorders may result in hyperthyroidism, Graves\'
disease is a common cause.

Because thyroid hormones affect a number of different body systems,
signs and symptoms associated with Graves\' disease can be wide ranging
and significantly influence your overall well-being. Although Graves\'
disease may affect anyone, it\'s more common among women and before the
age of 40.

In any event, see your doctor to find an explanation for the high levels
of TPO antibodies, and be prepared to face a diagnosis of Hashimoto's
disease.
