**How could I pay an iPhone owner, when I only know his phone number?**

PayPal explicitly allows you to pay anyone with a phone number. How you
do this:

- Establish and add funding methods to a PayPal account
- Select "Send Money"
- Enter the phone number of the person you wish to pay, and the amount
  of money you wish to pay.
- The person will get a text message inviting them to join PayPal in
  order to receive their money.

I'm certain there are other ways to send money to someone simply with a
phone number, but PayPal is the one I know off the top of my head that
allows you to explicitly send money to someone with only a mobile phone
number.
