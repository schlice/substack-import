It is unreasonable of them for you to be unsafe in the apartment simply
because they feel inconvenienced by having to reach for a key. It's also
unreasonable for you to have to leave the apartment unlocked, even when
you leave, because they feel inconvenienced by having to remember to
take their keys.

But there is a simple and inexpensive solution. Find out if your
apartment will allow you to install a keypad lock. I would suggest one
that incorporates *both* a key and a keypad. Something like this:

The reason I linked this one is that it is *cheap*. It's less than \$50.
Note that it doesn't have all the whiz-bang smart features that more
expensive keypad locks have, but it achieves the purpose you're looking
for: your roommates will never be locked out again.

This particular lock also features an *auto-lock* function, customizable
from 10--99 seconds after it is opened. So *you* don't have to worry
about whether or not *you* locked the door. And if everyone has a code,
it doesn't matter if it is locked or unlocked.

Additionally, you can give the landlord one of the new keys and they
won't need to remember a code, so it shouldn't inconvenience your
landlord at all. Just keep all the old hardware (and the old keys) so
you can reinstall their old lock when you leave.

The last complex I lived in allowed us to install locks like this, so
long as we gave the landlord a copy of the new key, and we put it back
the way we found it when we left. Of course, you would be responsible
for any damage to the door you cause by doing this, but that goes
without saying. Just be careful and you'll be just fine.

Finally, if this is something that is really important to your
roommates, they'll happily chip in on the cost. For about \$15 a piece
if there are at least three of you, you can eliminate the problem of
lost or forgotten keys completely.

And if your complex doesn't allow you to change the door lock, start
locking the door anyway. Letting them get locked out a few times will
certainly help them to remember their keys next time.

Original question:

My roommates force me to keep the front door to my apartment unlocked
all day, every day. They say it's because they forget their keys or
don't want to reach into their pockets to grab the keys. What should I
do?
