**How does MS affect men and women differently?**

MS is diagnosed in women two to three times more frequently than men.
Scientists believe that this is due to a hormonal component related to
MS, but as of today, they simply do not know.

As far as symptoms are concerned, men and women are all stricken with
all MS symptoms to varying degrees. Each persons' MS is different, and
each one will see different symptoms. Even for those who experience the
same symptom, they will experience it differently.

Every case of MS is different.
