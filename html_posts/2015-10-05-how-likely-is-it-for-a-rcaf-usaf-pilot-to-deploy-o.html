**Content:** [I can\'t answer for RCAF, but in the USAF, if you\'re a
pilot, there\'s a virtual 100% chance that you\'re going to deploy at
one time or another.\
\
The only difference may have to do with the airframe. Long-haul aircraft
can do a three day mission overseas and return without requiring
deployments. But even they will deploy when resources need to be staged
closer to a particular theater. With global reach being the norm,
shorter deployments are becoming more frequent.]{.rendered_qtext}
