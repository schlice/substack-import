**What would happen if you smoked marijuana with your upper half laying
in Colorado, where it\'s legal, while your lower half was in Utah, where
it\'s illegal, and vice versa?**

You would be charged for violating drug laws, regardless of which state
did the arresting.

In Utah, you'd be arrested for using an illegal drug.

In Colorado, you'd be fined for not smoking within your house. You can't
smoke outdoors.
