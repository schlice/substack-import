**How soon do you think it will be till United Airlines backs out of the
public anti-NRA stand too?**

Delta is doing themselves a terrible disservice by being so limp-wristed
on their public stance.

They're now claiming that taking a stance against the NRA is actually a
"netural position."

It takes quite a leap of logic to "take an action" in order to "refrain
from entering the debate."

If they wanted to refrain from entering the debate, they simply would
not "pick and choose" which groups to whom they would provide group
discounts, instead of doing what they are doing today.

And it will not go unnoticed when NRA members simply choose to fly some
other carrier instead of United or Delta.

Remember, it's not the NRA's lobbying efforts that have power, it's
their constituency.
