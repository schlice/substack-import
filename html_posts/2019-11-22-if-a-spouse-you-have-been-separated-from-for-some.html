**If a spouse you have been separated from for some time decides to
trade a couple of vehicles that are in your name without authorization,
and the dealer accepts them and then sells them without clear
documentation, where do all parties stand?**

1.  Separated does not equal divorced. No property rights have changed.
2.  You said the vehicles are in your name. They cannot be sold without
    your consent. Title cannot be exchanged without your consent.

You should contact an attorney about this. Sooner rather than later.
