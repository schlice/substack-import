**The Trump International Hotel is sold out for the 4th of July Trump
extravaganza despite charging double what similar properties are
charging. Does this violate the emoluments clause?**

Short answer: no.

Longer answer: The Emoluments Clause does not prevent a president from
running a business. The Emoluments Clause prevents a president from
working for (and being compensated by) a foreign government.

Trump has already stepped down from the board of directors of the Trump
organization, and has placed his assets into trust. Some have argued
that he hasn't done enough, because his assets are not in a *blind
trust*.

However, it's difficult to put the Trump name into a blind trust; the
Trump name on a hotel makes money regardless of whether or not the
assets are in a blind trust.

Now, does this mean that the president can't violate the Emoluments
clause using his hotels? Not at all. For example, if the president
charges foreign dignitaries triple the going rate at the Trump Hotel and
then later on makes a foreign policy change which positively benefits
that foreign country, the Justice Department should be looking very
closely at whether or not Trump was "paid" (however indirectly) to make
that particular policy change.

But running a business (and charging *market value* for a hotel room,
whatever the market will bear) is not in and of itself a violation of
the Emoluments Clause.

The Constitution never intended the president to lose his businesses
just to be President.
