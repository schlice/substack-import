If the police handcuff someone, this amounts to a *detention*. The
ability to detain someone temporarily is permitted under *Terry v.
Ohio*, sometimes just called a *Terry stop*. *Terry* stops can take
place when the officer has a reasonable suspicion that the person is
involved in criminal activity.

If the police were to handcuff someone (thus detaining them) without
having a reasonable suspicion that the person is involved in criminal
activity, this would constitute an *unlawful restraint,* which is a
violation of Texas Penal Code ยง 20.02.

If you feel this has happened to you, you should contact a lawyer in
your jurisdiction to see if an unlawful restraint case is a possibility.
