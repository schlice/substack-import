**Content:** [It depends on the configuration of flags. According to US
Flag Code (which is part of Federal law), in a group of flagpoles, the
US flag has to be farthest right (from the perspective of the building
that they adorn, but they can all be the same height).\

If you have a group of flagpoles and the center pole is higher than the
others, the US flag must fly on the highest pole, and the other flags
can be distributed around it.\
