**If a federal crime is committed on an Indian Reservation does the FBI
have the legal authority to intervene? Or do they have to be invited by
local authorities?**

The tribe does not have the authority to prosecute Federal crimes, just
as a city, county, or state police agency does not have authority to
prosecute Federal crimes. Since the FBI has authority everywhere in the
United States (including on the res), the local field office of the FBI
will investigate the crime.
