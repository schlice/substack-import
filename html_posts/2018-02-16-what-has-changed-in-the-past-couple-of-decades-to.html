**What has changed in the past couple of decades to make mass shootings
such an issue?**

*Deinstitutionalization.*

A big word for a massive change in the mental health landscape in the
United States in the 60s. In essence, it was a change from state-run
psychiatric facilities (which were, admittedly, in desperate need of
overhaul and regulation) to community facilities (halfway houses) and
neighborhood clinics. It also set the bar very high for a court to
declare a person as "mentally defective," which is the standard required
to limit guns.

But here's the thing: a mentally unstable individual can now *choose* to
ignore treatment, and nothing can be done. If they stop showing up at
their neighborhood clinic to get their drugs, they stop. No one can
pursue them.

And often, those are the people who need the most help. Many of our most
recent batch of shooters have had mental issues, been on psychotropic
drugs, etc.

When we changed how we handle the mentally deficient, we certainly
helped the situation in many state-run mental hospitals, but we
abandoned much of the treatment that many of these people still needed,
because we gave them control of their own treatment. No one would allow
a toddler to fly a 747, because they don't have the skills to do so.
Neither should the decision to continue therapy for the mentally ill be
left to the mentally ill person themselves, as they lack the capacity to
determine whether or not they need continued treatment.

The mental health crisis is bigger than the opioid crisis (no disrespect
to the brave people fighting for the problems caused by our current
opioid epidemic). Ignoring the fact that the United States changed how
it deals with the mentally unstable, followed soon after by an increase
in mass shootings by unstable people, does a great disservice to the
many people who should be *patients*, not *prisoners.*
