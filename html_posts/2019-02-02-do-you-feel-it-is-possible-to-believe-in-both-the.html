**Do you feel it is possible to believe in both the 2nd amendment and
gun control?**

No.

The Second Amendment is unchangeable without a Constitutional amendment.
While it is open to interpretation, it can't be changed wholesale.

Gun control is as nebulous a concept as you can possibly get. What
exactly does that mean? Does it mean actual things like universal
background checks or does it mean abstract, useless things like banning
certain configurations of firearms, magazine capacity limits, waiting
periods, and other "feel-good" measures with no actual benefit?

Without a good discussion regarding what "gun control" looks like, and
an agreement on what it is and what it is not, you're never going to be
able to come to consensus on what needs to be "controlled."
