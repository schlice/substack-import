First of all, we're not talking about "using stop and frisk." I never
even mentioned it. We're talking about "broken windows theory" which has
**nothing to do** with stop-and-frisk. I don't really care what policies
Minneapolis chooses to use in their enforcement. It's the ***types*** of
crimes that matter, not the nature of determining when to intervene. You
can still use broken windows theory without stop-and-frisk. Two totally
different things.

Secondly, ***I*** didn't use Minneapolis, that's a quote from someone
else. Don't like her figures? Feel free to tell her. Here, I'll even do
all the "hard work" to find the place where you can do so:

[[Heather Mac
Donald](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c3803d&url=http://www.manhattan-institute.org/expert/heather-mac-donald){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="manhattan-institute.org"}]{.qlink_container}

Just click the "Comment" button in the upper right side of the page,
where you can feel free to tell her whatever you like about her figures.

Until then, I'll feel free to quote the figures that I believe are
sourced from experts who have done the legwork.

If you don't like my response and you still feel your answer is right,
feel free to answer the question yourself, but don't blather on to me
with your comments and nothing to back them up. I have at least provided
credible academic sources to show where I came up with my figures. You
cite nothing. I suspect you made those numbers up, but no one will know
until you cite your sources.

And your silly trope about Republicans causing this is entirely
unfounded. The cities in the United States with the largest increases in
crime have been led by Democrat mayors and Democrat governors, under the
leadership of a Democrat president.
