**Does fast charging a mobile phone lead to a faster battery drain?**

No, but there is evidence that constantly fast charging mobile phones
leads to decreased overall battery life.

Why? The fast charge circuit and the increased load on the battery
generates more heat, and the battery components break down faster over
time.

However, we're talking something like an 11% reduction in battery life
over two years (IIRC), and many people will swap out their phones for
newer, shinier ones before that.
