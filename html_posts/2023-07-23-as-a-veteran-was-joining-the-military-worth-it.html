Yes. You were with it.

Worth what, you ask? My health. I\'m a disabled veteran. I\'ll live with
continuous health problems for the rest of my life because of my
service.

But it was still worth it. Your freedom was worth it. You were worth it.

Given the choice, I\'d do it again, without hesitation.
