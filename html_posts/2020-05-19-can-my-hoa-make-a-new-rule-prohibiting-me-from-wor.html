**Can my HOA make a new rule prohibiting me from working on my car
inside my garage?**

HOAs have broad latitude over the areas under their purview. In general,
if their rule does not violate a Federal, state, or local law, they
usually can do it.

There may be certain circumstances why they would not be able to do it,
such as a Covenants that prevents them from making specific types of
rules (like rules about the interior of a home, including the garage).

But other than that, the HOA can make such a rule, so long as it
followed the rules about how to make a rule in its own Governing
Documents.
