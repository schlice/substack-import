Sadly, the pear phone and the pear pad that they use on Nickelodeon
shows such as *iCarly* and *Victorious* is not real. It is a prop, and a
pretty blatant take on Apple products (get it? Apple, Pear, both fruits
roughly the same size, etc)

You can get a pear phone case and pear phone stickers to theme your
iPhone to look like a pear phone. But in reality, there is no such thing
as a pear phone. It\'s a TV prop.
