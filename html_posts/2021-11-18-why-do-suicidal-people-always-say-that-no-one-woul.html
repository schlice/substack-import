First of all, suicidal people don't "always" say that no one would care
if they died. Some people are not being selfless. Some are intentionally
trying to hurt those around them.

**But regardless of how a suicidal person wants to influence others
through their death, this is just a symptom of the** ***flawed
thinking*** **which causes suicidal thoughts.**

Ultimately, when people think that taking their life will somehow
influence others, they have *overestimated their importance in others'
lives*. They are thinking more highly of themselves than they ought to.
Thinking that your death will either negatively or positively impact
others lives is no better than thinking that your **presence** is a net
positive on people\'s lives. *Both* are examples of flawed reasoning.

Unchecked, this flawed logic and flawed reasoning can grow until a
person feels like removing themselves permanently from the situation is
the best choice.

Original question:

Why do suicidal people always say that no one would care if they died
when that isn\'t true?
