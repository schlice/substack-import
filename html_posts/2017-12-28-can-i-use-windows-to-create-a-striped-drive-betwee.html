**Can I use Windows to create a striped drive between a 300MB drive and
1TB drive and then use the rest of the space on the 1TB to create
redundancy? Just so I\'m clear, I have two physical drives.**

Yes.

To accomplish this, open Disk Management, right-click on the free space
you want to start using, and click "New Striped Volume..." The New
Striped Volume Wizard appears. On the Select Disks page, select from the
available disks and then click Add to add the disks to the striped
volume. Select both disks and choose Next. Then, set the amount of space
to use on the disks for the striped volume. You will choose the entire
300 MB disk, and 300 MB of space on the 1 TB drive, and click Next. On
the Assign Drive Letter Or Path page, the default is to assign the next
available drive letter to the new volume. You can also mount the volume
on an empty NTFS folder on an existing volume, and click Next. On the
Format Volume page, choose the formatting options for the new volume.
Windows 7 and later supports only NTFS formatting from the Disk
Management snap-in (to format with FAT or FAT32, you need to use the
command line). Click Finish on the summary page to create the volume. If
the disks are basic disks, you'll be warned that this operation will
convert them to dynamic disks (which is why you need to back up the
volumes before you do this). Click Yes to convert the disks and create
the striped volume.
