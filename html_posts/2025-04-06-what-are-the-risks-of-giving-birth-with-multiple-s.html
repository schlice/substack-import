So here's the answer you were probably looking for from someone who
actually knows something about MS.

**It is completely safe to have children if you have MS.**

That said, there are a few things to think about.

1.  Not all MS therapy medications are completely compatible with
    pregnancy and/or breastfeeding. If you plan to get pregnant and/or
    breastfeed, talk to your neurologist about options you can pursue.
2.  During your pregnancy, you'll find that your personal symptoms get
    better. This is believed to be because of hormonal changes and
    because your body's immune system "ramps up" to protect both you and
    the baby. You'll feel really good during your pregnancy. But just as
    commonly, *once you give birth, you can expect that you'll have a
    relapse soon after.* This is just one of the joys of MS and
    motherhood.
3.  Finally, the risk for developing MS in the general population is
    about 1 in 750. When you have a *first-degree relative with MS*
    (either a parent or a sibling), that risk increases to anywhere
    between 1 in 100 and 1 in 40. Now, there's absolutely no guarantee
    that your children will develop MS. But it is true that the risk is
    slightly increased. There are lots of other factors which determine
    the overall risk of developing MS; heredity is just one of them.

To be clear, I am just making sure you have the complete picture; I'm
not telling you to not have children. Once you are aware of the very
minor risks, you can feel safe pursuing having a child while you have
MS.

And as always, if you have MS and you'd like to have a baby, talk to
your neurologist **early** and **often**. It can make your pregnancy as
smooth as possible.
