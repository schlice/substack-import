There are treatments available, but they do not treat the actual disease
itself. The treatments available today lessen the severity of relapses,
reduce the duration of relapses, and increase the amount of time between
relapses. The treatments also slow the progress of the disease. All of
the approved MS medications do these things, with varying degrees of
success for each person, as well as various routes of administration (SC
injection, IM injection, infusion, or oral pill).

The treatments still do not treat the actual **cause** of the disease,
because it is still unknown.
