**When the local law enforcement agency is corrupt and has been that way
for so long that it\'s impossible to find an honest cop, how do you get
help.?**

The same way everyone else gets help when local law enforcement is
(hypothetically of course) so corrupt that they can no longer function.

You pay for it.

If you need something investigated, you hire a private investigator. If
you need a crime researched, you go around the police and go to the
District Attorney's office. If you need 911 services from the police,
you handle it yourself and call the corrupt cops to clean up the mess.
Just make sure you have enough payola that they'll look the other way
when they figure out that you "might" have done something wrong. Use
their corrupt nature to your advantage. Hey, if they're that corrupt,
money always works, right?
