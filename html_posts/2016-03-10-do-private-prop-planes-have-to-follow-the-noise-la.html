No, aircraft noise, first of all, is controlled by the FAA, not the
local police.

Aircraft must fly at a minimum above 500 feet AGL, so in general, noise
shouldn\'t be a terrible concern. But if it is, try to get the tail
number of the aircraft and contact your local FAA office. They can check
to ensure that the aircraft meets noise regulations.
