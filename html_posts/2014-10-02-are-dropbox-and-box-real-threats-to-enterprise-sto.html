**Content:** [They are absolutely players in the market. Threats? Not
really.\

EMC has its own cloud storage offering (Syncplicity) which boasts the
largest array of device offerings, larger than any other cloud storage
company. EMC and Syncplicity is a \"leader\" in [[Gartner\'s newest
Magic
Quadrant](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9f1010&url=https://www.syncplicity.com/whitepaper/gartner-efss-magic-quadrant){.external_link

Synchronization and Sharing.\

But none of those other companies have the financials to back up their
SaaS (Storage as a Service) plays. EMC has never been in the red, and I
can count on one hand the number of times they missed targeted earnings,
ever. EMC has the widest array of offerings, covering the entire data
life cycle, the Professional Services to fit those solutions anywhere,
and world-class Customer Service to support the
business.]{.rendered_qtext}
