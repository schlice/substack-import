**Why do some people focus on the gun type used in the Parkland
shooting? The murderer could have easily done the same horrific thing
with another rifle or handgun. In other words, he\'s a killer no matter
what tool he uses to craft the killings.**

SSSHHHHHHHHHH!!!!

Don't tell them that!

Let them take out their aggression on AR-pattern rifles and try to ban
them. It's not going to happen, no matter how many high school kids cut
class to protest. At best, Congress might pass a law which makes bump
stocks an NFA item. Beyond that, there is not only no political will to
ban AR-pattern rifles (especially when we know that there are plenty of
other popular rifles which also shoot 5.56, have detachable magazines,
etc), but *it has already been tried before*, and it has accomplished
nothing.

The adults know that it's up to the drive-by media to "drive-by" this
story, and once they do, we'll be back to fixing the real issues.
