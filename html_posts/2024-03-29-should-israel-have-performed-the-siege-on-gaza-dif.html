The problem is that the innocent deaths you refer to were not caused by
Israel. They were caused by Hamas ***intentionally putting civilians in
harm's way*** so that you specifically can get all spun up about how
brutal Israel is.

Yeah. you fell for it.

I'll admit, Hamas' propaganda machine is pretty good, and they're
targeting exactly the people they need to elicit sympathy from:
***American Leftists.***

You're literally out here doing Hamas' work for them.
