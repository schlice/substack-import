If you fail to pay your dues for a long enough time, the HOA can put a
lien on your home to cover the unpaid dues and fees. This means that if
you try to sell or refinance your home, you'll have to pay off your lien
with the proceeds of the sale before you collect any remaining profit.

If you still go even longer without paying, even after a lien has been
placed on your property, the HOA can foreclose on the lien, forcing your
house to be sold to recoup the money they are owed. The sale of the home
will pay off your mortgage.
