Since running a government typically isn't done for a grade, or held to
academic standards, whether or not another nation's constitution mimics
ours is somewhat entertaining but mostly irrelevant.

Look at it this way: "Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery." In
layman's terms: they looked at our constitution and they liked it so
much that they decided to pattern their own after ours.
