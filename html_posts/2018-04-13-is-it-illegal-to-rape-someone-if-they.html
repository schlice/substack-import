**Is it illegal to rape someone if they\'re dead?**

You cannot rape a corpse. In the United States, there is no federal
legislation that prevents sex with a corpse. However, almost all states
have some legislation making sex with a corpse a crime. Depending on the
state, it is a misdemeanor or a felony. In Colorado, Abuse of a Corpse
is a Class 2 Misdemeanor (CRS 18--13--101).
