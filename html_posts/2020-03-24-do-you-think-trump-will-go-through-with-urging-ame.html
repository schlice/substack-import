**Do you think Trump will go through with urging Americans to go back to
the office, restaurants, etc., even if health experts say that it\'s
premature?**

Yep.

Health experts are going to look only at health concerns. That's fine.

But health experts are unconcerned with the effects their methods have
on the economy.

Yes, it's true that if we self-isolate for the next 18 months, we can
completely eradicate airborne disease. But we'll also destroy the
economy.

If we all have to stay home, how will we earn the paychecks we need to
pay for those homes? How will we earn the paychecks we need to buy food?

Trump knows that there is a balancing point between what health experts
would like to see and what the economy needs.

You should be incredibly thankful that you have a businessman in the
White House right now and not a doctor. When the economy rebounds, you
will thank Trump for that.

Yes, some people will be stupid. Yes, some people will die. But that is
happening anyway, and the economy is virtually shut down right now.

Is it right to kill the economy to kill the virus?
