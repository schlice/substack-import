**Do prisoners have a right to free medical care? Do retired people on
Social Security & Medicare have a right to free medical care? Should
prisoners have rights that people who chose not to break any laws ever
are denied?**

I see what you did there. You asked three questions and tried to make it
like a logic problem.

You said, in other words:

- Prisoners have a right to free medical care.
- Retired people on Social Security and Medicare routinely have
  treatment denied because of a lack of coverage.
- Is it right that prisoners (who have broken the law) don't get denied
  coverage but retirees do?

Your argument starts from a fundamentally flawed position: **people have
a right to free medical care.**

In the United States, no one has a right to free medical care, as
medical care is not a right. It's also not a privilege. It's a business
transaction. And health insurance isn't real insurance either, it's just
a pre-payment plan with costs shared by you and your employer. You also
seem to claim that prisoners are never denied treatment, and this is
also not true. Many treatments available to retirees are simply not
available to prisoners, the most notable of these is quality mental
health care. [\[1\]](#QJPIC){#cite-QJPIC .citation_link}

With this understanding, how do prisoners receive medical care? Who pays
for their medical care? **We taxpayers pay for prisoners' healthcare**.
Prisoners cannot work for themselves, they don't pay for their own
healthcare, and they can't supplement their coverage. The state pays for
their healthcare and it is wrapped up in the cost of administering the
prison.

Who pays for retirees healthcare? **Retirees pay for their own
healthcare**. Their care is *supplemented* by programs like Medicare and
Medicaid, but those programs don't completely pay for their healthcare,
and like most health plans, not everything is covered. The difference?
Retirees can supplement their health plans with their own funds, or even
with supplemental insurance, sometimes called "gap coverage." Prisoners
do not have this option.
