With relation to Christianity, "being homosexual" and "wrong" are terms
of art which must be nuanced before we can answer the question.

Love in the Bible is a strange thing. The big issue we have is
translation. There are [[six different words for
love](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=23034c&url=https://www.yesmagazine.org/health-happiness/2013/12/28/the-ancient-greeks-6-words-for-love-and-why-knowing-them-can-change-your-life){.external_link

simply say that "homosexual love is wrong." You have to *define* which
love we're talking about.

Most of the Greek forms of love are allowed, and even encouraged,
between same-sex people in Christianity. But one type of love, *eros*,
is limited to married couples, and the Bible only recognizes marriage as
something which God has ordained between one man and one woman.

So "being homosexual" in and of itself is not "wrong" according to my
religion. "Engaging in homosexual sex" is considered to be a sin in my
religion, and could rightly be classified as "wrong."

But that sin makes the homosexual *exactly like everyone else in
Christianity:* ***a sinner.*** We are all sinners. We may sin
differently, from one to another, but we're all sinners. I'd rather not
dwell on my past sin, but I was a sinner, just like the homosexual.

That said, we are *saved* through God's grace: he gives us what we do
not deserve. He pays for our past sin. He does this when we **repent**
and **believe.**

Repentance involves a "turning away" from our past sins. We acknowledge
that we are sinners and that we have fallen short of the glory of God.
And crucially, we resolve to *turn away* from our sins and to not sin
any more.

In short, we admit we did the bad things, and we stop doing the bad
things.

In return, we're given, freely, everlasting life. Sounds like a pretty
good deal.

Being a homosexual is no different than being addicted to porn or drugs,
or allowing money to supplant God in your life, or being an adulterer,
or being \<insert_your_sin_here\>. The difference is that the Christian
recognizes his or her sinful ways, and resolves to not sin any more.

No one said it would be easy. It is never easy to struggle against the
desires of the flesh. Sin is pleasurable, of this there is no doubt. But
we recognize our sinful nature and we resolve to be *better* than our
sin. This is what God wants for us. He knows we are human. He took human
form so he could experience everything we experience, including the
temptation of sin. So he truly knows what we go through.

But he overcame it. He lived a sinless life. While we fall short of that
standard, he recognizes who we are, and he knows our heart.

The question becomes: do you desire the sin more, or do you desire God
more?
