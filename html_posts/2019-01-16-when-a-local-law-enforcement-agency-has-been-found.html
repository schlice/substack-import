**When a local law enforcement agency has been found to be in violation
of the constitution for a habitual practice, what happens to those
victims who have already served their sentences pursuant to an arrest
based on the unconstitutional practice?**

At best, they can sue the department for pain and suffering, and as a
punitive measure, but that depends on whether or not the department
should have known at the time that the practice was unconstitutional.

Remember that, even though what the department was doing may have been
unconstitutional, the person was tried in a court of law, with
(presumably) a vigorous defense). There was ample opportunity to
question the constitutionality of the practice.

Note too that the department was most likely acting in good faith,
attempting to enforce the law through what they thought were
constitutional means.

And if a court interpreted those means, at the time, to be
constitutional, and it was only recently ruled to be unconstitutional,
then it's unlikely that even a civil remedy could be successfully
pursued, for the same reason.
