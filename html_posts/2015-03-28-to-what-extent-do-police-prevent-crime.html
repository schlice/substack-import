**Content:** [It\'s a function of numbers. There aren\'t nearly enough
cops out there to be able to effectively catch criminals immediately
after a crime has been done. We\'d need far more cops to be able to have
that sort of saturation in the general population, and that sort of
society turns more into a police state than I\'d like to see.\
\
Whether they catch the criminal 5 minutes after, or 24 hours after, the
crime is not really relevant. So long as they catch the criminal, they
have accomplished their stated duties. Why would the speed of
apprehension affect a criminal? If a criminal knew he\'d be caught
within 24 hours, would he still commit the crime?\
\
Sadly, this is the actual reason that crime persists: most criminals do
not get caught. The very large majority of crimes go unsolved. It\'s
true that if there is not a significant lead within the first 48 hours
of a crime, the possibility of catching the criminal reduces by nearly
50%. So speed is definitely of the essence.\
\
Let me just add one more thing. Police are there to catch the criminal
after the crime. That fact puts your well-being in ***your*** hands, not
in the hands of the police. There will always be crime, there will
always be criminals, because there will always be people, and people are
people. But your well-being is up to you. You can choose to be a victim
of crime, or you can fight back. The choice, and the consequences, are
up to you. Don\'t be a bystander in your own life.]{.rendered_qtext}
