**Content:** [In the United States, there is no blanket ban on mobile
phones in schools and/or colleges. Mobile phones are generally allowed
in the buildings, but in grade schools, they are either not allowed or
required to be on mute or vibrate, in the classroom. This is up to the
policy of the individual school or district. This is for several
reasons:\

1.  They are distracting, and it is impolite to interrupt a lecture with
    your phone\'s noises
2.  Children at that age are easily distracted, and the teacher would
    really like to teach the curriculum with the students\' full
    attentions, or as best as they can get it.

\
College is similar, except that in most cases, phones must be on
vibrate. Students in college are expected to be more mature, and whether
or not they pay attention to the curriculum is their decision.
