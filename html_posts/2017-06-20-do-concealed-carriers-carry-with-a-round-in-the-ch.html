Oh yes, every time. It's like American Express: "Don't Leave Home
Without It."

- It doesn't make the firearm any less safe. Most modern firearms have
  several internal safeties which prevent the gun from firing unless you
  pull the trigger. Our instructor in the military told us we could
  hammer nails with the back of the gun and it wouldn't fire. I wasn't
  about to test the theory, but I see where he's coming from.
- When you need that firearm, you need it *yesterday.* You have zero
  time to waste on anything, including chambering a round.
- When you draw your firearm, it's because you intend on using it. You
  don't draw it to play with it. You don't draw it to threaten someone.
  You draw it because you are planning on shooting someone. As in the
  previous bullet, you have zero time to waste on anything, because
  fractions of seconds count.
- Also, it means you can carry one more round of ammunition. That's why
  you'll sometimes hear that a firearm can carry "X+1" rounds, which
  means the capacity of the magazine, plus one round in the chamber.
