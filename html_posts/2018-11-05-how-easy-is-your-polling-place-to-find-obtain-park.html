**How easy is your polling place to find, obtain parking at, and get in
and out of?**

My polling place is ridiculously easy to find. I don't need parking, and
I can vote in my pajamas.

Yes, I'm being facetious. Colorado has all mail-in ballot voting.

You can vote in person if you didn't receive your ballot, or if there is
something else that prevents you from using your mail-in ballot, but if
you received a ballot in the mail, that's how you vote.

If you distrust the mail system (or your postal carriers), you can
hand-carry your ballot down to either one of our local DMV offices
(those are County offices as well), or to the County Clerk's office.
This is what we do. There is positive hand-off, we ensure that our
ballots get dropped off, and we get our stickers. Call me old-fashioned,
but I like my sticker.

The all mail-in system also means that my family (I have four voting-age
people living in my house now) can sit down and debate the ballot
measures. Interestingly, Colorado had the most ballot measures of any
state on the 2016 mid-terms. We literally had a two-page ballot this
year (three sides).
