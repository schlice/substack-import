Yes, commercial arbitration is legal.

Most times, arbitration is an agreed-upon restriction that both parties
knowingly enter into when signing a contract. Enjoining both parties
from lawsuit and instead forcing them into binding arbitration is a
feature of many commercial contracts. Relief can usually be obtained
quicker and for less money.
