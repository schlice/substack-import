In most jurisdictions, the notice that a claim has been filed also
includes directions about not destroying any evidence, even if that
evidence has not been requested through discovery yet. From the moment
the claim has been made, and you have been notified about it, the
evidence is protected.

If you destroyed the evidence before you were notified of a claim, you
might be protected, but only if you had no knowledge that a claim was
forthcoming. If you knew that a claim was being processed, and you
destroyed evidence with that knowledge, and the opposing party is able
to prove that you knew the claim was being processed, the destruction of
evidence can cause you to lose your case.
