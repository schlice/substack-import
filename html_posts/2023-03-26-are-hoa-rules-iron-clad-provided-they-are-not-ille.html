If your HOA has rules which govern late assessments and other violations
and your Board failed to follow those procedures, I strongly suggest you
retain the services of a real estate attorney in your local area who
specializes in HOA law and file a countersuit against the Board for
failing to abide by the Governing Documents.

The Board is required by law to follow the Governing Documents. Period.
Any deviation from that must be for extraordinary extenuating
circumstances, and always in favor of the homeowner.
