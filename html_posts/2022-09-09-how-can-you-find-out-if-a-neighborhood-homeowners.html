It's actually pretty simple, and you can do it all from your PC.

**Step 1: Find the name of the HOA.**

If an HOA exists in an area, it will be noted on the property
information located on the county property assessor's website. Property
details are public record. So take an address from the neighborhood and
plug it in to the county's property assessor's website, and the detailed
listing for that property should give you the name of the HOA which
controls that neighborhood.

**Step 2. Get info about the HOA**

HOAs aren't "kid's clubs." They are 501(c)(4) non-profit corporations.
This means they all have actual corporate filing documents and bylaws
and articles of incorporation, which will all be on file with the state.
So your next stop will be the state licensing agency which handles
corporations within the state. Different agencies handle corporations in
each state, but most states seem to allocate that practice under the
Secretary of State's office. Regardless, find that office for that state
and you can do a record search, plugging in the name of the corporation
you learned in Step 1, and get all of its corporate information and
Governing Documents.

There you have it, you can now find HOA information for nearly any
neighborhood in the US.
