It\'s time to let her go.

Seriously, if she\'s telling you that she finds another guy in
particular more attractive than you, don\'t hold her back! Give her the
opportunity to see if she\'ll enjoy time with that guy more than you.
She\'s not your possession, you guys aren\'t married, so let her go!

But don\'t wait around for her. Shake the dust off your feet, and move
on. Here\'s the hard part: if it doesn\'t work out between her and this
guy who she found more attractive than you, don\'t be surprised if she
comes crawling back.

Don\'t take her back.

If she left you once for somebody more attractive, she\'ll do it again.
Yes, this will not be easy. But you are worth it, not just guys who she
finds more attractive. You. You are worth it. Don\'t sell yourself
short. When you cut her loose, don\'t carry a torch for her. Seriously,
move on.

Original question:

What\'s your response when your girlfriend openly admits that she finds
that other guys or a particular guy more attractive than you?
