**What are the top five de-escalation tactics taught to American police
officers during their training?**

There isn't a "top five." There is a "this is the best one and this is
what you do."

*And it's free for you to learn as well.*

It's called "Verbal Judo," and it is one of the best de-escalation
tactics taught to US police officers.

Here's the course. Be aware, the video is over an hour long, but as I
said, you can watch and learn these techniques yourself, no Academy
admission required. I linked a second video which is the same training
broken into four parts. I linked part 1, and you can go on to watch the
rest.
