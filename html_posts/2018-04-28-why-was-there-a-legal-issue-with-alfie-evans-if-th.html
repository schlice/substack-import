**Why was there a legal issue with Alfie Evans: if the parents had
alternative providers they preferred, is there some law in the U.K. that
prevents them from treating their child as they see fit?**

Doctors said that Alfie suffered from a degenerative brain condition,
and they determined that not only was continued care futile, it was not
in his best interest. The doctors intended on removing Alfie's life
support.

Alfie's parents appealed to the courts to allow him to be transferred to
another facility. The parents fought for months to get permission to
relocate him to another facility, and eventually even appealed to Rome,
and the Pope attempted to intercede as well. Italy was prepared to grant
Alfie citizenship, and the Vatican was prepared to take him to Vatican
Children's Hospital for continued care.

However, the courts in the UK always side with the child, even over the
wishes of "well-meaning, but often misguided," parents. UK courts will
always keep the child's best interest first, and the courts decided that
the doctors were correct, that there was nothing more that could be
done, and that keeping Alfie on life support was not in his best
interest.

For those of you in the United States reading this: **this is what
single-payer, state-run healthcare looks like.** Parents no longer get
to decide what is in your child's best interest. The state gets to
decide, since the state is the doctor and the state is the payer.
