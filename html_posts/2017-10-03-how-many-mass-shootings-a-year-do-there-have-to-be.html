You and I both know something is wrong.

We simply disagree on **what**.

You think the problem is that we have too many guns and we should just
get rid of them all.

I think the problem is that we have too many crazy people and we should
get rid of *them*.

When you can tell me how you get rid of 300 million guns without
violating the Constitution, I'll tell you how we can get rid of all of
the crazy people.
