**Content:** [Other than the sight picture, there isn\'t much that is
the same. Think about it: when you fire a real gun, it\'s a small
explosion going off. In your hand. That\'s a bit frightening for anyone.
And it\'s much louder and more violent than you would expect. Much more
kick than your controller gives you.\
\
Plus, when you aim down the sights, you have to focus someplace; and
when you focus, it\'s on a point somewhere in the distance, so the stuff
at further distance and closer distance is blurry. When you shoot, you
focus on the front sight. That means the rear sight, and your target,
are slightly blurry. Not exactly what you see in the
game.]{.rendered_qtext}
