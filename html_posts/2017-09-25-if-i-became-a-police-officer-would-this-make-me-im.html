Not only does this **not** make you immune to obeying traffic laws, but
in our department, every contact with local law enforcement, both on and
off duty, must be documented and delivered to the chain of command. Too
many of those (even those where you did not get a ticket) will force an
internal review of your training and perhaps a closer look at whether or
not you should remain employed at that agency.
