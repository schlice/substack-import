It definitely seems that this is a statement buried in a question. And
it's dripping with irony.

> **A clergy person asking for mercy. My God what is the world coming
> to?**

Is that all this particular clergy person did? Is this the questionable
statement?

Because if this is all that was said, then I totally agree with you. A
clergy person asking for mercy is a non-issue.

So let's *zoom out* and look at the entire statement:

> *Let me make one final plea, Mr. President. Millions have put their
> trust in you and, as you told the nation yesterday, you have felt the
> providential hand of a loving God. In the name of our God, I ask you
> to have mercy upon the people in our country who are scared now. There
> are gay, lesbian and transgender children in Democratic, Republican,
> and Independent families, some who fear for their lives. The people
> who pick our crops and clean our office buildings; who labor in
> poultry farms and meat packing plants; who wash the dishes after we
> eat in restaurants and work the night shifts in hospitals. They...may
> not be citizens or have the proper documentation. But the vast
> majority of immigrants are not criminals. They pay taxes and are good
> neighbors. They are faithful members of our churches and mosques,
> synagogues, gurudwaras and temples. I ask you to have mercy, Mr.
> President, on those in our communities whose children fear that their
> parents will be taken away. And that you help those who are fleeing
> war zones and persecution in their own lands to find compassion and
> welcome here. Our God teaches us that we are to be merciful to the
> stranger, for we were all once strangers in this land. May God grant
> us the strength and courage to honor the dignity of every human being,
> to speak the truth to one another in love and walk humbly with each
> other and our God for the good of all people. Good of all people in
> this nation and the world. Amen*

So there were a few points which turned this from a **sermon** into a
**political statement**:

Budde addressed Trump---who was seated in the front row---directly, by
citing his belief about being saved by God from assassination and said:
"In the name of our God, I ask you to have mercy upon the people in our
country who are scared now."Addressing a single person in the
congregation already puts this sermon on shaky ground. But she
continued.

Budde\'s plea mentioned "gay, lesbian and transgender children in
Democratic, Republican, and Independent families," across the country
"who fear for their lives." This is a left-wing talking point. They fear
that Trump is going to murder people because they are gay. Let's be 100%
clear: **no one has ever, ever even** ***hinted*** **at the fact that
LGBT people should be killed.** If they fear for their lives, it's
because someone told them they should be afraid, and those someones are
the people on the Left. So this sermon has now completely transformed
into a left-wing political speech. But she continued.

The bishop also spoke up for immigrant workers, including those who may
not "have the proper documentation," saying the vast majority of them
are "not criminals" but rather "good neighbors." This is another
left-wing talking point, claiming that because illegal aliens are "good
neighbors" that they should not be treated like criminals, **despite the
fact that they are**. Violating immigration law is indeed a crime,
whether the criminals are good people or not. Your "goodness" doesn't
absolve you of your crimes. Certainly, they should be treated humanely,
but they should also be treated humanely as criminals.

Finally, she said, "Our God teaches us that we are to be merciful to the
stranger, for we were all once strangers in this land." Now she has
taken what she turned into a political speech and started munging
Christianity, suggesting that God would overlook crimes because "we were
all once strangers." While it's true that God is indeed infinitely
merciful, He is also infinitely *just*. And justice demands payment for
sin. Thankfully, God provided Jesus to pay for sin on our behalf, if we
accept Him.

To that end, God does not overlook crime. He provides a way out, if we
accept it. But God is infinitely just, and He does not *overlook* crime.
He does not *ignore* crime. Crimes must be paid for by someone.

\

In short, this was a sad sermon. It was more about people than it was
about God. It was more about how Trump relates to others than how Trump
relates to God. And if I were the bishop, I'd be more worried about
Trump's *soul* than his *policy*.

I think the bishop should stay in her lane.
