Absolutely zero legal implications.

Regardless of how many neighborhoods are owned by a developer, each
association is bound by its own Governing Documents, and each has its
own Board of Directors. The developer can choose to enact whatever
Governing Documents he chooses for each neighborhood he owns, in
accordance with state law.

Once the homes in the neighborhood are all sold, the developer has no
further stake in the Association (unless given so by the Governing
Documents), and the Board can change that when the Board transitions
from developer control to homeowner control.

In other words, when the developer is done developing, the Board shifts
to homeowner control and becomes independent of the developer.
