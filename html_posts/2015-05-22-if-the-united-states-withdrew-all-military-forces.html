**Content:** [ISIS would NOT simply stop fighting and go back to their
homes.\
\
ISIS WILL likely grow in power, take over the remainder of Libya, move
on to Iraq and Iran, and will gain enough power to start launching
attacks against the US mainland. They may do this if we continue to
resist them, anyway.\
\
If we don\'t keep bringing the fight to them, they will MOST CERTAINLY
bring the fight to us.]{.rendered_qtext}
