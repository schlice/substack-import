**Content:** [And the defense would **VERY** easily show that the police
officer was following the law to the letter when trying to effect a
traffic stop, and the defendant refused to stop, for almost a mile. They
will then show the in-car recording that shows that the defendant had
many \"safe places\" to stop and she failed to do so.\
\
And the defense would then present the **ACTUAL SUGGESTIONS** provided
by the state of Indiana, which say **FIRST CALL 911**, and ONLY KEEP
DRIVING WITH FLASHERS AND WAVING ARMS **IF YOU CANNOT REACH AN
OPERATOR.** They will then show that the defendant\'s cell phone did not
call 911 during the time period; therefore, she did not follow the
recommendations of Indiana police, and was simply refusing to stop
because she has a fear of reprisal or a fear of law enforcement, or
simply disregards the law. Then they\'ll show every other incident that
she was involved in, and will develop a pattern in this particular
person of lawless behavior, and say that this is no different.\
\
Remember that the whole \"waving your arms\" thing is just SUGGESTIONS,
it is not LAW. If you think that this should be LAW, you lobby your
congressman in your state to pass a law. A police officer, or a chief of
police, can make a suggestion; that does not make it LAW. It\'s still
unlawful to fail to stop for police, and you failing to stop means you
accept the possibility that you are not stopping **FOR AN ACTUAL POLICE
OFFICER**, for whatever reason you might cite, and you accept the
repercussions of that decision.\
\
You\'re right, no prosecutor is going to touch this case with a ten-foot
pole. They are going to allow the arrest to stand.]{.rendered_qtext}
