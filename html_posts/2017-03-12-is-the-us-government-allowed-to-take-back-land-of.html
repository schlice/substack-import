Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question, but the Homestead Act did not
provide for any remaining ownership of land granted under it by the US
government. Once that land was given, it was deeded to the homesteader.
When you hold the deed and there are no riders on the deed, you own the
land. Period. To the best of my knowledge, the government did not retain
any ownership in the land deeded to homesteaders under the Homestead
Act.

Additionally, the Homestead Act was sunsetted by the Federal Land Policy
and Management Act of 1976. This officially ended homesteading in the
United States (except in Alaska, where it continued until 1986).
