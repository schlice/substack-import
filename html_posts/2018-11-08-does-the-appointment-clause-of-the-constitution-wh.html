**Does the Appointment Clause of the Constitution, which provides that a
"principal officer" in the federal government may not be appointed
without Senate confirmation, make Matt Whitaker's appointment as acting
Attorney General invalid?**

No.

The Appointments Clause says that the actual appointment must have
"advice and consent" by the Senate. In the interim, the President is
able to appoint "acting" Agency heads while the actual
Constitutionally-approved method for appointing an Agency head is
underway.

That process is controlled by the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, passed
in 1998. The Act states who can be appointed to become an interim head
of an agency while the process to find, nominate, and confirm a new head
of the agency is in progress. It provides for three classes of people
who can serve as acting officials:

- By default, \"the first assistant to the office\" becomes the acting
  officer.
- The President may direct a person currently serving in a different
  Senate-confirmed position to serve as acting officer.
- The President can select a senior \"officer or employee\" of the same
  executive agency, if that employee served in that agency for at least
  90 days during the year preceding the vacancy, and is paid at a rate
  equivalent to at least a GS-15 on the federal pay scale.

By these rules, Matt Whitaker's appointment as acting AG is legal. He
was formerly Chief of Staff to AG Sessions at the Justice Department,
which meets the criteria for a "senior officer or employee" of the same
agency.
