No, she absolutely would not be shot. If they could reach her, they
could pull her down. But if she's beyond reach, she would need to either
go up or go down. One way or another (assuming she survives her climb),
she'll be arrested, either when she reaches the bottom, or when she
reaches the top.

This happened in 2016 in New York City. A man scaled Trump Tower using
suction cups. He was arrested and charged with reckless endangerment and
disorderly conduct.

Original question:

Could the police force a person who was climbing the outside of a
skyscraper with suction cups to stop the climb if she didn\'t want to? I
don\'t think they\'d shoot her.
