Because it is illogical.

The Law of Causality speaks against the universe being the ultimate
cause of all we know for this simple fact: an effect must resemble its
cause. This being true, no atheist can explain how an impersonal,
purposeless, meaningless, and amoral universe accidentally created
beings (us) who are full of personality and obsessed with purpose,
meaning, and morals. Such a thing, from a causation standpoint,
completely refutes the idea of a natural universe birthing everything
that exists. No atheist has been able to adequately explain how this
could be.

Former atheist Lee Strobel summed up the atheist conundrum this way:
"Essentially, I realized that to stay an atheist, I would have to
believe that nothing produces everything; non-life produces life;
randomness produces fine-tuning; chaos produces information;
unconsciousness produces consciousness; and non-reason produces reason.
Those leaps of faith were simply too big for me to take, especially in
light of the affirmative case for God\'s existence. In other words, in
my assessment the Christian worldview accounted for the totality of the
evidence much better than the atheistic worldview."

Atheism is insufficient because it requires far more faith to believe it
than to believe that a creator created everything. Atheism is
insufficient, therefore, because it takes too much faith to be an
atheist.
