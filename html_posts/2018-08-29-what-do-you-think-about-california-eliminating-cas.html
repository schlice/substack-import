**What do you think about California eliminating cash bail or cash
bonds? Should this be enacted all over the country?**

This is what happens when social justice takes over for common sense.

This initiative was done to promote "fairness" between the rich and the
poor. Instead of "bail reform," they opted for "bail removal" instead.
Now, instead of assigning bail, a defendant is assigned a "Low,"
"Medium," or "High" risk for flight, and incarceration before trial is
determined.

So now, instead of a wide range of bail amounts which could be set
depending on the defendant's ability to pay, you've been reduced to
three categories, and your incarceration is entirely dependent on that.

So on the plus side, it's not unfair any more. If you're rich or if
you're poor, no one will get bail. So that's fair.

On the minus side, the entire pre-trial incarceration process is now
100% paid for by California's taxpayers, a burden they don't need to be
taking on right now.

Additionally, since it is now up to a judge to determine whether or not
someone will be incarcerated pre-trial, it opens the door for *more*
abuse by judges who impart their own biases into the proceedings.

It will lead to increasing amounts of incarceration of people who
previously would have posted bail, overcrowding jails even further.

So California has traded a toothache for a headache. But hey, if the
SJWs are happy, California is happy.

Whether or not any other states should do this is up to each state. I
think the voters in each state will certainly decide for themselves.
