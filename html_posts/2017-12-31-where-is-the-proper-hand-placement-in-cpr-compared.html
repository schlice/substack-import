Most of the time, you can do the chest compressions with the bra in
place.

Your correct hand placement on adults:

- Find the sternum (the big flat bone in the dead center of the chest).
- Find the base of the sternum.
- Measure two fingers width distance from the base of the sternum with
  your non-dominant hand.
- Place the heel of your dominant hand right next to your two-finger
  measurement on the sternum. That is the correct location to perform
  chest compressions.

You should be able to perform the compressions successfully without
having to move the bra.

I think the only situation which might cause problems is if you're
actually pushing the base of the bra, and underwires are cutting into
the skin. In that case, I'd move the bra out of the way and continue
chest compressions. Look, modesty is out the door when a heart is not
beating.

Similarly, to get correct AED probe placement, you would use the
included forceps in the AED kit to cut the bra off. That's a must for an
AED, but not necessary for chest compressions.
