You said you are 15, so your medical decisions are currently under the
control of your parents unless you are an emancipated minor.

Your doctor checks your genitals to ensure that you are developing
correctly and that nothing appears out of the order. They physically
check your testicles to look for signs of testicular cancer (which is
something [[you should start doing
yourself](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a16ab6&url=https://kidshealth.org/en/teens/tse.html){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"

now). They check for [[inguinal
hernias](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=248475&url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/inguinal-hernia/symptoms-causes/syc-20351547%23:~:text%3DAn%2520inguinal%2520hernia%2520occurs%2520when,hernias%2520do%2520not%2520cause%2520pain.){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="mayoclinic.org"}]{.qlink_container} by placing a finger next
to your genitals (at the crook of your leg and torso) and asking you to
cough. An inguinal hernia would be easy to feel pulsing when you cough.
These are all standard checks that a doctor would perform during an
annual well-patient checkup, and it's not at all abnormal.

But even for us adults doing an annual checkup, they don't "make you get
naked." At best, they ask you to drop your pants under a sheet, which
they reach under to work with.

You should know that it only gets worse the older you get. Once you
cross 40, they start checking your prostate, and that check is done via
a digital rectal exam. After age 50, they start checking regularly for
colon cancer.

Anyway, if you are uncomfortable with any of these checks, you should
discuss that with your parents. If there is really an area of concern
there, your parents can help you have the discussion with your doctor.

Original question:

I\'m a guy and 15 and getting a yearly checkup. I\'m very healthy. Would
they make me get naked and look at my dick for some reason if there is
nothing wrong with it? Can I refuse?
