**Can someone who disapproves of gun violence become a police officer
and choose not to use the gun they are provided?**

In short, no. You'll never be admitted into the academy if you admit
that you won't fire a weapon. In order to be certified by the state as a
law enforcement officer, you must fire your weapon proficiently.

However, there are other jobs within law enforcement that are unarmed
jobs. Some Community Service Officers are unarmed, while the Police
Auxilliary and Reserve Deputies in some communities are also unarmed.

If you are interested in law enforcement but you don't want to be armed,
you might consider volunteering in one of those other roles.

If, however, you are insinuating that you would fire your weapon in
training but would never fire it in practice, that's a recipe for
disaster. **A sworn officer must be armed and must be prepared to use
that firearm. Failing to do so when needed would be a dereliction of
duty, and puts the lives of other officers as well as the public at
risk.**
