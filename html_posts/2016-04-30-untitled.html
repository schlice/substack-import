**Content:** [There is one glaring issue that you failed to address.\

If you are using the facility in a wartime capacity other than as a
hospital. For example, the enemy could be using the hospital as a

hospital, a church, or a personal residence, **it\'s a valid military

target.]{.rendered_qtext}
