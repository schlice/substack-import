**What does it mean when they say a California judge yesterday dismissed
the Stormy Daniels defamation suit against Michael Cohen and Donald
Trump \"with prejudice\"?**

A dismissal with prejudice means that the court is dismissing the case
based on its merits. This means that a court has looked at the merits of
the case and has made a decision based on the merits.

Dismissal with prejudice is a *final judgement*. This means that the
case cannot be brought again. The case is permanently dismissed; the
plaintiff cannot bring this action again.
