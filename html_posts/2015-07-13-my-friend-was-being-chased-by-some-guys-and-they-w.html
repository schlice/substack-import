**Content:** [We can\'t give you direct legal advice on Quora.\

Best advice: find a criminal defense attorney, pronto.\

You might be able to argue that you were in fear for your life so you
can try to mount a defense against grand theft auto charges. But you\'ll
need a **good** criminal defense attorney. And they\'re not cheap.

the best possible thing you can do for yourself.]{.rendered_qtext}
