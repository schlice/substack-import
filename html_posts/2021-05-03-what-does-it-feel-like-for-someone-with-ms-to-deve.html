Ever tripped on a line on the floor? I know there\'s nothing there to
trip on, but you do anyway.

Ever tripped going up the stairs? Your foot just doesn\'t make it to the
stair for some reason.

Ever dropped things without moving around? Seemingly for no reason? It
just falls out of your hand?

In the beginning, that\'s what it feels like to lose muscle strength on
one side of your body.

To me, it meant that my medicine had stopped working, and it was time
for a change. I also had to start working on strengthening those
muscles.

It\'s a constant battle with your own body betraying you in ways you
never thought possible.
