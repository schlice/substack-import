It is not the presence or absence of a transition team that makes one
the president-elect. The president-elect is the president-elect when he
has actually been elected.

*And despite what the media is trying to tell you, that has not happened
yet.*

That event will actually happen when the electoral college votes. If the
electoral college awards Biden more than 270 votes, he will be the
president-elect.

And not one second before.

The media is free to continue to call him president-elect. You are free
to call him president-elect. He is free to call himself president-elect
if he chooses.

None of that actually makes him president-elect.
