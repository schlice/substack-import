**If a civilian holding a legal firearm pointed at a criminal and is
waiting for the police to arrive, and the criminal starts to run or
tries to attack you, are you within your rights to shoot if they are not
holding a weapon?**

First of all, you are already in tricky legal waters, as you are
pointing a firearm at an individual who is not presenting you a threat
of death or grave bodily harm.

As painful as it is to hear, that person can sue you for assault as well
as unlawful imprisonment. You as a civilian do not have a right to hold
another civilian at gunpoint until the police arrive.

If the suspect just completed stabbing someone 27 times, I think you
might be able to make the case that they are a continued threat until
the police arrive. But you must be careful. If the person is not an
active threat, you cannot point a gun at them.

I would suggest, if you are a concealed carry holder, researching what
the **low ready position** is, and using that instead. You still face
the same threat of lawsuit for unlawful detention, but you stand a much
better chance of having that charge dismissed if you are not actively
assaulting the person at the same time (i.e. tort assault).

If they start to run away, not even the police have the right to shoot
them.\* If they are posing no threat to you, you cannot shoot them.
Period.

If they start to run towards you or try to attack you, you can usually
make the case that you were, in fact, in fear for your life, and deadly
force is warranted.

\* There are, of course, exceptions to every rule, and there are legally
codified conditions under which police can shoot a fleeing suspect.
Primarily, those conditions revolve around a *continuing threat* to the
community in allowing that person to escape. It is allowed under common
law, but in the United States, the case *Tennessee v. Garner* in 1985
limited police use of deadly force against a fleeing suspect. The
justices held that deadly force \"may not be used unless necessary to
prevent the escape and the officer has probable cause to believe that
the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious bodily harm
to the officer or others.\"

Military police have *far broader* jurisdiction to use deadly force
against a fleeing suspect, especially if that person has in his
possession classified materials or explosive devices. We actually have
eight different conditions under which we can use deadly force, and two
of them involve the release of classified information, one involves
anything which can cause substantial harm to the general public, and one
is for the apprehension of a fleeing prisoner. The last one is following
the issuance of a lawful order.
