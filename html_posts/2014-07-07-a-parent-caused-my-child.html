**Content:** [I think you have more options than you realize.\
\
The waiver usually says that the facility is not responsible for any
injuries that occur while using the stuff, and the injuries can come
from anywhere, even other people. So the facility clearly is protected
by the waiver.\
\
HOWEVER, as is the case with all waivers, a waiver does not protect the
facility against its own negligence. I would venture to guess that the
facility does not allow more than ONE party on the trampoline at once.
EVEN IF YOU SIGNED A WAIVER, IF THE FACILITY WAS **NEGLIGENT**, you can
still sue the facility. This is one I would seriously check in to. If
the trampoline is not specifically designed for multiple people to jump
on at once, or if the facility specifically disallows more than one
person on the trampoline at once, you can still sue the facility for
negligence, regardless of the waiver. The facility is not allowed to act
negligently, even with a waiver. Those things are not iron-clad, and
they don\'t unilaterally protect the facility from anything under the
sun. The facility still has to take reasonable protections to keep your
kids safe, like making sure that more than one person isn\'t on the
tramp at once. I would definitely check into this one, since that seems
a little off to me.\
\
As for suing the injuring party, you would have to make the case that
she was acting in a reckless manner, and it was her recklessness that
caused the injury. Where she gets her money to pay your expenses is
irrelevant (i.e. does her homeowner\'s insurance pay). If she was acting
in a negligent manner, endangering herself and those around her, she can
be sued for negligence in civil court and you can be reimbursed for your
medical expenses along with \"pain and suffering\" like the adjustments
you had to make to your vacation to accommodate the temporary handicap.\
\
So, of course, the trick is to prove recklessness or
negligence.]{.rendered_qtext}
