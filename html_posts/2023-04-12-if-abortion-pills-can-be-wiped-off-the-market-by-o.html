If it can be proven that abortion pills are actually harmful, and the
companies that manufacture them knew about that harm and covered it up,
it is prudent that a judge pull them from the market until the details
can be sorted out.

You'd want that kind of power to be resident in a judge because
timeliness of response is required.

And in this specific case, we found that the FDA did not do the
necessary work to ensure these drugs were safe. For example, the FDA
never studied the effects of these drugs on anyone under 18. They are
required to, under their own rules, but they did not. You have 12- and
13-year-old girls taking these drugs, and their effects have never been
tested.

Also, in studies conducted by the Charlotte Lozier Institute, up to 8%
of women experienced complications resulting from the abortion pill
regimen. In 2020, there were over half a million chemical abortions. If
just 5% of those women had complications, that means 25,000 women had
complications. Objectively, if 25,000 women have complications from a
drug, that drug is not safe.

And none of these statistics include abortion drugs that were shipped
illegally.

But there are details on both sides, and two different judges seem to
have taken two different opinions on the same question. This will have
to be sorted out by the Supreme Court, as it is exclusively their
jurisdiction when two Circuit Courts differ on the same issue.
