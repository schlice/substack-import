**What Does Jesus mean when he says you cannot serve both God and
mammon. How do I respond to this Guy on YouTube?**

First, "mammon" is an old word which basically means wealth or greed, or
sometimes those things personified as a false god. In modern language,
we can just say "money" or "the acquisition of money."

What's important from this passage in the Bible, however, is what it
does not say. It does not say that you cannot ***lov*e** both God and
money. It says that you cannot ***serve*** both God and money.

The whole verse:

> Do not treasure up for yourselves treasures on the earth, where moth
> and rust cause them to vanish, and where thieves dig through and
> steal. But treasure up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where
> neither moth nor rust make them vanish, and where thieves do not dig
> through and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will
> be also.\
> ---Matthew 6:19--21 NIV
>
> No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love
> the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other.
> You cannot serve both God and money.\
> ---Matthew 6:24 NIV

"For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."

Who or what you *serve* is quite different from who or what you *love*.
You can love lots of things, but who or what you *serve* comes first in
your life. If you *serve* the acquisition of wealth and possessions, if
that comes before God in your heart, you actually don't love God,
because God says that he is to be first in your heart.

In other words, you can love lots of things, but you can only serve one
master. God says to *serve* him. The acquisition of wealth comes later.
