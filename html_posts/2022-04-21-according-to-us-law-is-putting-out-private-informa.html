What you are referring to is an act called doxing.

In the United States, there are very few laws surrounding doxing. There
are two Federal laws which might address it, but they are old and were
never intended to address this issue.

States are coming up to speed with laws against doxing, and victims
would be best served by looking to their state to address it:

> Much of the conduct that is considered "doxing" may fall under
> multiple state laws relating to **cyber stalking, stalking,
> harassment, threats, or extortion** (e.g., threatening to make
> information public if money is not paid). A doxer can also be charged
> if he **illegally obtained the data** about his victim, such as from
> protected government databases.[\[1\]](#AGyVn){#cite-AGyVn

Original question:

According to US law, is putting out private information about someone as
a way of retaliation considered illegal?
