Sometimes, Google is your friend. If you were to Google the Republican
party platform and specifically ask about healthcare, you would get this
response from
[[GOP.com](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cca836&url=http://GOP.com){.external_link

specific questions are answered):

> We believe that taking care of one's health is an individual
> responsibility. Chronic diseases, many of them related to lifestyle,
> drive healthcare costs, accounting for more than 75 percent of the
> nation's medical spending. To reduce demand, and thereby lower costs,
> we must foster personal responsibility while increasing
> \[preventative\] services to promote healthy lifestyles. We believe
> that all Americans should have improved access to affordable,
> coordinated, quality healthcare, including individuals struggling with
> mental illness.
>
> Our goal is to encourage the development of a healthcare system that
> provides higher quality care at a lower cost to all Americans while
> protecting the patient-physician relationship based on mutual trust,
> informed consent, and privileged patient confidentiality. We seek to
> increase healthcare choice and options, contain costs and reduce
> mandates, simplify the system for patients and providers, restore cuts
> made to Medicare, and equalize the tax treatment of group and
> individual health insurance plans. For most Americans, those who are
> insured now or who seek insurance in the future, our practical,
> non-intrusive reforms will promote flexibility in State leadership in
> healthcare reform, promote a free-market based system, and empower
> consumer choice. All of which will return direction of the nation's
> healthcare to the people and away from the federal government.
>
> To return the States to their proper role of regulating local
> insurance markets and caring for the needy, we propose to block grant
> Medicaid and other payments to the States; limit federal requirements
> on both private insurance and Medicaid; **assist all patients,
> including those with pre-existing conditions, through reinsurance and
> risk adjustment**; and promote non-litigation alternatives for dispute
> resolution. We call on State officials to carefully consider the
> increased costs of medical mandates, imposed under their laws, which
> may price many low-income families out of the insurance market. We
> call on the government to permanently ban all federal funding and
> subsidies for abortion and healthcare plans that include abortion
> coverage.
>
> To achieve a free market in healthcare and ensure competition, we will
> promote price transparency so that consumers will know the actual cost
> of treatments before they undergo them. When patients are aware of
> costs, they are less likely to over-utilize services. We support
> legislation to cap non-economic damages in medical malpractice
> lawsuits, thereby relieving conscientious providers of burdens that
> are not rightly theirs and addressing a serious cause of escalating
> medical bills. We will empower individuals and small businesses to
> form purchasing pools in order to expand coverage to the uninsured.
> **Individuals with pre-existing conditions who maintain continuous
> insurance coverage should be protected from discrimination.** We
> support technology enhancements for medical health records and data
> systems while affirming patient privacy and ownership of health
> information.

>
> Consumer choice is the most powerful factor in healthcare reform.
> Today's highly mobile work force requires portability of insurance
> coverage that can go with them from job to job. The need to maintain
> coverage should not dictate where families have to live and work.
> Putting the patient at the center of policy decisions will increase
> choice and reduce costs while ensuring that services provide what
> Americans actually want. We must end tax discrimination against the
> individual purchase of insurance and allow consumers to purchase
> insurance across State lines. While promoting "co-insurance" products
> and alternatives to "fee for service," government must promote Health
> Savings Accounts and Health Reimbursement Accounts to be used for
> insurance premiums and should encourage the private sector to rate
> competing insurance plans. **We will ensure that America's aging
> population has access to safe and affordable care. Because seniors
> overwhelmingly desire to age at home, we will make home care a
> priority in public policy**. **We will champion the right of
> individual choice in senior care. We will aggressively implement
> programs to protect against elder abuse, and we will work to ensure
> that quality care is provided across the care continuum from home to
> nursing home to hospice.**
