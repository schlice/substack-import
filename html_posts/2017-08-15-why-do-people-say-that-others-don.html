This is somewhat of a misstatement of what actually happens in emergency
rooms.

The truth is that the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA)
is a federal law that requires anyone coming to an emergency department
to be stabilized and treated, regardless of their insurance status or
ability to pay. That doesn't mean they don't get a bill. It simply means
that their treatment in an emergency department is not contingent upon
their ability to pay. That said, you can't get blood from a turnip; if
they have no money to pay, no amount of billing will get them to pay.

This law is what's called an "unfunded mandate." If a patient cannot
pay, the question becomes: who pays for that service? No funding for
people who cannot pay was attached to this federal law. So it's a
"mandate" that requires the hospital to find the money to pay for those
who have no insurance or cannot pay on their own.

Hospitals either have to "eat" that cost, or they rely on private
donations to offset the cost, or they pass the cost on to other, paying
patients in the form of higher facility charges.
