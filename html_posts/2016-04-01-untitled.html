I think you misunderstand the basis for when you can fire a weapon.

The level of scrutiny is \"fear for one\'s life.\" If you fear for your
life, you can use deadly force.

The police officer has a different level of scrutiny. The police officer
is not only charged with protecting his own life, but he is also charged
with protecting the lives of the general public. So while a civilian is
only authorized to defend himself, an officer has to make a judgment
call, in a split second, as to whether or not this person might continue
on and harm others. If the answer to that question *might* be yes, the
officer has a **duty** to stop that person. The law allows officers to
stop that person using whatever means are necessary.

If you don\'t believe that officers should have the authority to stop
criminals using whatever means necessary, you should lobby your
legislators to change the law in your state and remove that authority
from the police.
