In general, when calling from an international source, you cannot use an
800 service.

When you make a phone call, normally it is the caller who pays for the
call. In an 800 service, the called party pays for the call. That's why
the call is known as "toll-free." It's only toll free for the caller.
The called party pays a fee to use an 800-service number.

That fee does not include paying the cost for international calls.

Therefore, companies expecting calls from international callers will
also post a traditional area code and telephone number which can be
called by traditional international callers, who will pay for their own
call.

If you're trying to reach a company, check their website to find their
international direct dial number.
