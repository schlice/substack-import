The answer, as with all legal answers, is "it depends." And in this
case, it depends on what your Governing Documents say about the matter.

Remember that you can always reject the violation and sue the
Association based on the fact that they're writing violations without
proof. Additionally, before you pay, you can demand to see the evidence
proving the violation, and if they cannot produce the evidence, you can
refuse to pay simply based on that alone. Then, once they fine you, you
can sue them, but of course you'll need to retain your own attorney to
do that.
