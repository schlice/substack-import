Mass shootings? Probably not.

A vast quantity of **crime** is indeed caused by socioeconomic factors,
occurring most notably at socioeconomic borders. We could end a lot of
**crime** by fixing socioeconomic issues.

Mass shootings are most often caused by **mental instability** coupled
with **perceived injustice.** There's a lot of things you have to fix
before mass shootings will start to decline, most notably the system by
which people receive mental health treatment.
