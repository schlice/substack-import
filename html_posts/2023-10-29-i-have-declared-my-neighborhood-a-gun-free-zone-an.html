Everyone here is telling you that you are a troll, which you are. But
let\'s pretend to give you a good answer.

The one stubborn coward actually isn\'t cowardly. He\'s protecting his
home and his family, as is his right. And there is nothing cowardly
about a man standing up for his family and protecting them.

Anyway, so how do you get him to give up his guns? You show him that you
can protect him better than he can. He can only respond to threats
within seconds. You have to show him that you can respond within
milliseconds or microseconds, and with better accuracy and less chance
for collateral damage or accident.

Once you do that, he\'ll see that he doesn\'t need his guns, because
crime no longer exists for him.

Simple. But not so much.
