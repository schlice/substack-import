**A federal district judge has demanded that President Trump\'s
accounting firm Mazars turn over President Trump\'s accounting
information prior to him becoming President. Your thoughts on this?**

Why is Congress investigating what Trump did *before* he became
President? What relevance does this have at all on Congressional
lawmaking, or as a legitimate Congressional oversight function?

It seems to me that Congress is fishing for anything they can hang on
him to drag him down for 2020.

And that's not their job.
