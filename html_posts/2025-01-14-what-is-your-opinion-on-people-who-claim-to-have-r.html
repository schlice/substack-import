I'm quite pleased with them. You can even do it a little bit at a time
over the course of a year, if it seems daunting.

You may have to do a little bit of catching up, but you can even start
today and still read through the entire Bible in one year.

\

What I would be *more* concerned with, rather than the capability of
reading through the entire Bible, is *prayerfully understanding it.* The
words on the page don't speak to you. The Holy Spirit speaks to you,
through your reading of the Bible.

You can read all the words and understand them. But to *really* get
something out of the Bible, you need to read with an open mind and an
open heart. *That* is the part that many people who simply claim to have
read the whole Bible have not done.
