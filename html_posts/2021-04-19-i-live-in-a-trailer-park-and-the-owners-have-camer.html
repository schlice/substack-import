The answer, as is the answer to all legal questions, is "it depends."
And what it depends on is *state law*.

In many states, you can record video in private places with consent. In
some states, you can consent to recording by passing a prominent sign
which states that recording devices are in use and proceeding further
constitutes consent to such recording.

However, in virtually all states, in public spaces (or more precisely,
privately-owned property which is open to the public), you can be video
recorded and no signage is needed.

In the vast majority of cases, the law turns on what is a ***reasonable
expectation of privacy***. If you are in, say, a locker room, you
probably have a reasonable expectation of privacy. However, if you were
on a private street between rows of trailer homes, you probably would
***not*** have a reasonable expectation of privacy.

One private location where security camera monitoring may be in effect
is in fitting rooms in department stores. But these locations would have
very clearly marked signage indicating that video surveillance is in
use, and in order to enter the facility, you would see the signs. This
video helps to deter shoplifting.

In all cases, if you are going to install cameras, to best avoid legal
trouble, you should have the cameras in plain sight, and post a notice
that video surveillance is in use. But the notice is not required in
most states when the cameras are in plain sight and are in a public
location.

If the camera records *audio* along with the video, other rules about
the usability of that audio in court exist.
