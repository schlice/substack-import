I answered a similar question already:

[[Bill Stein\'s answer to Can one get arrested for being nude in one's
backyard?](https://www.quora.com//Can-one-get-arrested-for-being-nude-in-one-s-backyard/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container}

In short, it depends on what state you're in. And in most cases, it's
not related to where you physically are (in your backyard, or in your
house in front of an open window), but it's more related to the laws on
indecent exposure, which vary from state to state.

In some states, like New Jersey, you can be cited for indecent exposure
if you are in an area which can reasonably be seen by someone who didn't
consent to look at what they are seeing. In others, like Colorado, the
exposure must be sexually-related in order to be charged with indecent
exposure. You either have to be having sex, or exposing yourself in a
sexually explicit manner (i.e. touching yourself explicitly). Simply
"being naked" where you can be seen by someone else does not constitute
indecent exposure there.

visible to anyone outside (blinds open, bright lights, sliding glass
doors, etc.)?
