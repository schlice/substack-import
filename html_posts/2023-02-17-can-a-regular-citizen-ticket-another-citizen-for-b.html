There isn't a jurisdiction I know of which allows a citizen to issue
binding citations on behalf of a local government to another citizen.

The person issuing citations on behalf of a government must be
authorized by that government to do so. That's why police officers wear
a "badge," which is short for "badge of office." It recognizes the
authority they have been granted by the government to enforce the law.
The badge is a universally-accepted symbol of authority granted by a
government under its authority to create laws and enforce their
compliance. The person granted the badge has been trained and authorized
by the government to enforce said laws.

I *have* heard of citizen groups which are occasionally issued handheld
radar units. [[This

citizen initiative to run radar. Here is how the program is described in
the article:

> In citizen radar programs, volunteers monitor vehicle speeds using a
> department-issued radar unit. The vehicle speed and time are written
> on a log sheet. In the event a violation is observed, the volunteer
> will attempt to document the vehicle\'s description and license plate
> number. Usually, letters are then mailed to the registered owners
> advising them of the observed violation. When citizens run radar, they
> don\'t issue tickets or appear in court.
>
> \"There\'s no enforcement, but it sends out a strong message,\" says
> Lt. Daniel Furseth of the DeForest Police Department in Wisconsin.
>
> The programs are educational for everyone. Drivers who are going too
> fast learn they need to slow down, neighbors often learn that vehicles
> aren\'t actually traveling as fast as they thought they were, and
> police departments learn how to more effectively allocate resources to
> address speeding problems in their communities.

It's a win-win-win. It's the same function as a "smart trailer" (I know
you've seen them):

This unit not only has a RADAR unit and a display, but it also has a
laptop, recording average speeds on the target road at specific times of
the day. The software will generate a graph showing when speeds on that
road are highest, and officers can be deployed during those times to
maximize their effectiveness in reducing speeds.

But rather than incurring the cost of a smart trailer, you can not only
get the same information, but you can alleviate citizen concerns, get
them involved in community-based policing, and save money.
