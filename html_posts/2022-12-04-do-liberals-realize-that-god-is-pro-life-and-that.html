Look, I'm pro-life and Christian, but this interpretation is just wrong.
*Because that's not how God works*.

And what's the logic there?

- We kill children
- God gets mad
- So God...kills children

Huh?

Hopefully you can see the lack of logic in that line of thought.

God is very straightforward here, there's nothing ambiguous about what
He believes and what He will do. God didn't create evil. God doesn't
condone evil. God hates evil, in fact. God would like nothing more than
for people to stop being evil.

*But God gave you a choice. And He respects your right to make it.*

So if you want to kill babies, He will let you. Same holds true for any
other sin in the books. If you want to commit that sin, God will let
you.

**But if you do not accept Christ as your savior and place your trust in
Him and ask for forgiveness for your sins and repent,** ***the
punishment for those sins will fall on you*.**

We already live in a fallen world. Living in a fallen country is part
and parcel of living in a fallen world. We're not going to be punished
because we live in a country that allows abortion. *But those who know
that abortion is murder and who stand by and say nothing will be judged
for their own deeds.*

Everyone will be judged for what they alone have done. We don't get
judged as a nation by God. We get judged individually, one at a time.
Our sins are laid bare. *Someone* is going to have to pay for those,
because God, above all else, is just. That debt must be paid. For
believers, Christ already paid for our sins with his death and
resurrection. We are redeemed by Christ. For non-believers, there is no
one to pay for those sins but the non-believer. And if sin is not paid
for, the non-believer cannot remain in the presence of God, as He does
not abide sinners in His kingdom.
