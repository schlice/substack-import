**Content:** [This is the same reason that the M-16, arguably one of the
best military rifles ever, removed the fully automatic mode in the A3
version, replacing it instead with a three-round burst fire mode.\
\
Even for the best shot, fully automatic mode is very difficult to
control, and when in that mode, most good shooters will only fire a few
rounds at a time. While I can\'t shoot as fast as an automatic rifle
using a semi-automatic pistol, I can shoot pretty fast. Guess whether
I\'m more or less accurate when I do that.\
\
Some weapons systems work much better in a fully automatic mode; best
example I can think of is the SAW (the M249 Light Machine Gun \[LMG\],
also known as the Squad Automatic Weapon). Unlike the Uzi in Las Vegas
this past week, the SAW does not jump around when it is fired. Plus, our
SAWs can be vehicle-mounted, so they don\'t jump around *at
all.*]{.rendered_qtext}
