The word "scleroses" means "scars."

The "scars" occur on nerve cells in the central nervous system (CNS).

When the MS disease process occurs, the immune system mistakes the
myelin, which is the sheathing that coats nerve cells, for a foreign
invader, and attacks it. In the place of the myelin, a scar forms. The
scar is made of mostly cholesterol, but importantly, the scar is not as
good at insulating nerve signals as myelin. Nerve signals which traverse
the damaged areas are attenuated. The reduced signal through the damaged
nerves produces the various symptoms seen in MS.

Therefore the name: "multiple sclerosis" means "many scars."
