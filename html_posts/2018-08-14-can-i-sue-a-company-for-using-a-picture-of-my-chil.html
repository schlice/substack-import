**Can I sue a company for using a picture of my child without my
knowledge?**

The answer, as with all legal answers, is "it depends."

In this case, it mostly depends on where they got the picture, and what
they're using it for.

If they simply took a picture of your child out in public, then in most
cases, the picture is able to be used in nearly any way they want. They
can even post it online.

What they ***cannot*** do is use the picture for commercial gain. If the
picture is on their website where they used it to advertise a product or
sell something or make money for profit, this is illegal.
