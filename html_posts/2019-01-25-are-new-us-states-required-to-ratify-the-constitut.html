**Are new U.S. States required to ratify the Constitution?**

No, not ratify. It's already been ratified and has been the legal ruling
document in the United States for over 200 years. The original 13
colonies (the first 13 states) ratified the Constitution.

The Constitution itself, since the ratification, guides the admission of
new states (see Article IV, Section 3, Clause 2). We can use the example
of how states previously joined the Union to see how it occurs, and how
it might occur again. Let's imagine that the only real contender in our
modern time, Puerto Rico, decides it wants to become the 51st state.

Here's how the process works:

- Usually, a state is formed out of an existing territory. The organized
  government of that territory makes it known that they want to become a
  state. Usually, this is done by a *referendum*, which is a special
  vote of the entire population of the territory.
- Congress would then direct that territorial government to draft a
  **state constitution** using a constitutional convention. The state
  constitution must not contradict the US Constitution; in general, it
  mirrors the US Constitution. The people of the territory would accept
  that state constitution as their governing document.
- Congress would then review that state constitution, ensure it does not
  contradict the US Constitution, and Congress would then have to vote
  to admit that state to the union. Congress is under no obligation to
  admit a state to the union, but they must vote to allow a state into
  the union. Congress would adopt a joint resolution granting statehood.
- The President would make a proclamation announcing that a new state
  has been added to the union. The President is not involved in the
  process of admitting a state; admission of states is ultimately under
  the control of Congress.

This process has been mostly followed for the entire time we have
admitted states to the union. There have been a few one-off instances
where the process was modified, but for the most part, this is the
process by which a territory becomes a state.

There is no ratification of the Constitution required. Statehood implies
that the new state becomes automatically bound by the US Constitution,
and all of its rights are assigned to all citizens of that state.
