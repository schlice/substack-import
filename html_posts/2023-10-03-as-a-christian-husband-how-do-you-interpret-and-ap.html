When we interpret the Bible, we do not "pick and choose" methodology to
do so. Interpretation is the same for Colossians as it is for Leviticus
as it is for Revelation.

We use exegesis to understand the Bible. In other words, the Bible
explains the Bible.

We always seek to understand the context of a passage. **For text,
without context, is just pretext.** We do this by examining the larger
verse, then the chapter, then the book, and then in context with the
entire Old or New Testament.

We always remember that we are reading a *transliteration*, and to get a
full understanding, we need to understand what the passage said in its
original language, and we need to know how a native speaker of that
language would have understood the passage at the time it was to be
read.

With that in mind, let's look at Colossians 3.

This is part of Paul's letter to the believers in Colossae. It was
probably written while Paul was in prison in Rome, in about 62 AD. There
were some dangerous teachings circulating around at that time, so Paul
was writing to support and reaffirm the teachings of Christ to the
nascent church there. Paul wrote to caution against this false doctrine
and to support believers in their development into fully devoted
Christians. He highlights Christ\'s supremacy over all demonic forces.
Christians share in the power and authority of the risen Christ because
they are adopted by Him. Paul also exhorts these Christians to resist
sin, seek holiness, and live as clearly Christian families.

Colossians 3 is one part of the letter where Paul talks about how to
live as Christian families. He gives instructions for everyone in the
family:

> Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.
>
> Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them.
>
> Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord.
>
> Fathers, do not embitter your children, or they will become
> discouraged.
>
> Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything; and do it, not only
> when their eye is on you and to curry their favor, but with sincerity
> of heart and reverence for the Lord. Whatever you do, work at it with
> all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters, since
> you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a
> reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving. Anyone who does wrong
> will be repaid for their wrongs, and there is no favoritism. ---
> Colossians 3:18--25 NIV

The wife\'s responsibility in a marriage is to support her husband in a
way that honors God.

Other verses also outline the proper behavior for wives toward their
husbands in the eyes of the Lord. Peter advises that the wife should set
a good example of virtue for her husband to follow. In addition, he
exhorts them to refrain from corrective language (1 Peter 3:1--4). This
is probably due to the relational shyness of men, who interpret
criticism from their wives as rejection. According to Peter (1 Peter
3:1--6), males are more inclined to imitate women\'s behavior when they
employ words of encouragement and respect in addition to setting a godly
example. This authority must be administered \"in the name of the
Lord,\" and for their husband\'s advantage. They are assisting God by
doing this.

This tells us that *the wife\'s devotion to her spouse is going to look
different than accepted social norms.* She has the incredible
opportunity to carry it out \"in the name of the Lord Jesus\"
(Colossians 3:17). It is appropriate or proper for wives to serve their
husbands as is fitting in the Lord (occasionally the word meaning
fitting can be rendered as \"convenient\"). It is an act of devotion to
God and of love. Paul exhorts wives to serve their husbands in love,
something they have total power over. A wife is free to treat her
husband with the same devotion that she does to the Lord.

Now that we understand the context, we can address the next section (the
one you asked about), where Paul discusses husbands.

The husbands are commanded by Paul to love their wives and not harbor
resentment toward them. Here, the term meaning love is translated from
the Greek word \"agapeo.\" God demonstrated His love for us by sending
Jesus to the cross to die in our place. The husband must put the needs
of the wife first out of \"agape\" love: to serve while leading, giving
and empowering. Again, as in the case of the wife, *this goes against
social standards.* The husband\'s love for the wife is to be performed
as an act of service to the Lord.
