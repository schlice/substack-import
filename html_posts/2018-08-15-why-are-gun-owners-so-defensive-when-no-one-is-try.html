**Why are gun owners so defensive when no one is trying to take away
their guns? We just want criminals to not have guns. Shouldn't gun
owners be on our side?**

Propose gun control legislation that **only** impacts criminals, and
doesn't impact law-abiding citizens. Literally show me **one** new gun
law that only impacts criminals, and doesn't impact law-abiding
citizens.

Just one.
