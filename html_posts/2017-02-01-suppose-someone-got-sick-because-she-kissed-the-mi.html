You\'re already on the right track. Think about these points:

- Are mirrors intended to be kissed (or even touched) by end users?
  Their intended use, not their actual use, determines standards of
  sanitation.
- Does the establishment have a reasonable expectation that people will
  be kissing mirrors?
