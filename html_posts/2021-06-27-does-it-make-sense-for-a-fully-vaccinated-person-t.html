You're asking a question about "what makes sense" and that answer varies
from person to person. Some fully-vaccinated people are so concerned
about "showing care for others" that they still wear masks in public
just to show that they are not a risk to others. Some got vaccinated but
believe that fully-vaccinated people can still carry the disease and
spread it to others, so they choose to wear a mask to forestall that
possibility.

So does it make sense? That's for each individual to decide for
themselves. I think masks will stick around for quite a while, as we
normalize the ability for each and every person to decide for themselves
what is best for them.

Original question:

Does it make sense for a fully vaccinated person to wear a mask in
public indoor settings like supermarkets (I don\'t ask for an answer
from a legal standpoint)?
