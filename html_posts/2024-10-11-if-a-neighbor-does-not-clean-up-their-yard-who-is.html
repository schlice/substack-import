The neighbor is still responsible even if he doesn't do it.

Hopefully, you made the wise decision to live an a community with an
HOA. Bring the dirty yard to their attention, and their trashy yard will
begin to directly cost them money. In most places, having trash in your
yard is not illegal, so the city or the town won't even touch it. Sure,
some towns and cities may have some ordinances for excessive trash or
unkempt yards which you might be able to fight to get them to enforce,
but every HOA will ensure that your yard is clean and your lawn is
mowed, and it will hit that homeowner directly in their wallet.
