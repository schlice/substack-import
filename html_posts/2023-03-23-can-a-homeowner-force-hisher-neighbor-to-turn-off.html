In the United States, assuming we're talking about standard outdoor
lighting around a house, not spotlights or floodlights which throw large
volumes of directed light, then no, you cannot force a neighbor to turn
off their outdoor lights.

There is always a matter of *reasonableness* to consider in order to
determine if lighting is a nuisance or not. Is the light reasonable, or
is the neighbor's property lit up like Times Square?

If the lighting is unreasonable, the police may find cause to cite the
homeowner for a nuisance. Otherwise, if the lighting is reasonable, you
can't really force them to turn it off.

This is where an HOA might be a useful thing to have. HOAs can easily
determine that a nuisance exists and issue a violation letter citing the
nuisance. If the nuisance continues, the HOA can fine the homeowner
until they comply.

On the flip side, there is nothing stopping the complaining homeowner
from installing window blinds or curtains to block the light at night.
This is probably the easiest fix to the problem

Original question:

Can a homeowner force his/her neighbor to turn off their outdoor
lighting at night if it shines into the homeowner\'s bedroom windows and
keeps them up at night?
