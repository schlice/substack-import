**The President has cited the Constitution several times when explaining
why he has abrogated his duties in the Covid-19 crisis. What section or
clause is he relying upon?**

Perhaps we can start with what provisions of the Constitution you think
the President is 1. Constitutionally obligated to perform, and 2. that
he had chosen to "abrogate," while simultaneously citing the
Constitution for the reasoning?
