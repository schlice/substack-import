The short answer is that it is lawful to prohibit police from activating
their BWCs unless they are actively responding to a call for service, or
have engaged in an incident. The civil rights organizations feel that
it's dangerous for police to be able to record everything, because that
feels too much like a "police state" and that the video can be used
against honest citizens taking part in Constitutionally-protected
activity.

Those same civil rights organizations will have to reap what they sow
when the police videos presented at trial do not contain any of the
"lead-up" details before an incident, the very things that those same
privacy advocates wanted police to have BWCs for in the first place. The
BWC will only be activated when an officer engages in a call or is
responding to a call.

You can see an incident, but if you don't see what happened *before* the
incident, you don't see the justification for the use of force recorded.
This means that you must fall back to traditional jurisprudence in order
to determine whether or not the use of force was lawful, and the BWC
itself becomes less efficient. So depending on the local ordinances and
the timing of the officer engagement, it is possible that some of the
lead-up to the incident may not be recorded.

A jurisdiction is well within its rights to limit police in this way.
They must understand, however, that there are consequences to such laws.
