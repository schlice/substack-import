**Content:** [We can\'t keep the mentally ill away from guns until we
can do a better job of identifying ***who*** is mentally ill, and
***what*** constitutes a mental illness that is severe enough that it
can\'t be treated. Basically, until we fix the mental health system in
this country, there are no more laws or restrictions that we can pass
that will make any substantive difference without unduly burdening
law-abiding gun owners.\
\
The gun laws are not the issue. The treatment of mental health is the
issue.
[[Deinstitutionalization](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=18cb6f&url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinstitutionalization){.external_link

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"

inpatients, but it has indeed left a portion of the mental health
population, literally, \"out in the cold.\" It has marginalized that
group and has led to some not being treated at all. I want to quote the
above-linked page from Wikipedia, because it says exactly what I was
trying to say, but more succintly.\

And finally, the issue we are seeing most recently with the most violent
(emphasis mine):\

While deinstitutionalization has helped many rejoin active community
life, a portion of those people **actually needed continuous psychiatric
care** and are not getting it, because the laws have changed such that
entry into psychiatric care is generally only court-ordered or emergency
room physician ordered. This means that the vast majority of people that
really require continuous psychiatric care are actually on the streets
or incarcerated. The top three mental institutions in this country in
terms of population are prisons, [[the largest being the Cook County
Jail in Chicago,
Illinois](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ba425b&url=http://thttp://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/06/americas-largest-mental-hospital-is-a-jail/395012/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container}.\
\
The sad fact is that by implementing a process of deinstitutionalization
to try to re-integrate the mentally ill who can be successfully treated
with antipsychotics, we have actually created a population of people who
can\'t be treated on an outpatient basis. In other words, ***we have
created this problem ourselves***.\
\
We need common-sense reform of psychiatric care in this country so that
these people can be treated in continuous care facilities. We need to
remove the stigma that accompanies mental health. We need better
integration between psychiatrists (who generally do not counsel) and
mental health counselors (who generally cannot prescribe medications).\
\
Our mental health system is a mess, and many seriously ill patients who
need help either end up in jail or on the 6 o\'clock news.
