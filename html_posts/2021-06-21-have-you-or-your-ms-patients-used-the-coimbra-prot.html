I was treated using a similar protocol to Dr. Coimbra's approach. I was
on 5000 IUs of Vitamin D for a year because my Vitamin D levels were so
low.

I ended up with kidney stones.

Turns out, high-dose vitamin D is [[really bad for
you](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=947750&url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7218089/){.external_link

I guess I was fortunate that my hypercalciuria *only* led to calcium
oxylate kidney stones, after which I (wisely) stopped the vitamin D
therapy.

This type of therapy should only be done under the strict guidance and
supervision of a doctor, and as of yet, there are no repeatable, proven
results.

We know that MS occurs with greater frequency in higher latitudes. It is
*presumed* that this is due to the prophylactic effect of vitamin D in
the development of MS. However, we also know that beyond age 15, moving
to a new location (i.e. with lower rates of MS, or a lower latitude)
won't manifest in the current generation, but in the *next* generation.
So the effect of increasing vitamin D in adults and its effect on MS
have yet to be proven, at best.

As always, take everything you read on the internet with *massive*
grains of salt, never make any extreme dietary changes without
consulting your doctor, and never ever change your medications yourself
without your doctor's approval.

Have you or your MS patients used the Coimbra protocol? Link. What was
your experience?
