In order to quell dissent between the Federalists and the
Anti-Federalists (and in order to get all the states to sign the
Constitution, the promise was made that the first Congress would pass a
Bill of Rights, which is very similar to, and strongly influenced by,
the Virginia Bill of Rights.

The preamble to the Bill of Rights begins this way:

> THE Conventions of a number of the States having at the time of their
> adopting the Constitution, expressed a desire, in order to prevent
> misconstruction or abuse of its powers, that further declaratory and
> restrictive clauses should be added: And as extending the ground of
> public confidence in the Government, will best insure the beneficent

The preamble basically says that in order for "a number of the States"
to ratify the Constitution, they had to add protections in the form of
"declaratory and restrictive clauses" "in order to prevent
misconstruction or abuse of \[the Constitution's\] powers\[.\]"
