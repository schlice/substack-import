**Content:** [It is actually sceintifically proven, but it\'s not
exactly what you think. It is a medical phenomenon called
[[tetrachromacy.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=60137e&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrachromacy){.external_link

\
And it\'s not that they see *different* colors than anyone else. They
simply see wavelengths beyond those of a typical human being (into the
infrared and ultraviolet), and they are able to distinguish differences
and variations in colors that to everyone else appear identical. So in
essence, they see *more* colors than we do.\

The only confirmed tetrachromat alive is [[Concetta

part: she\'s an artist and she paints what she sees, so we can view the
world as she does. It\'s quite amazing.\
