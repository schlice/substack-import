**If a trans man (female to male) committed a violent felony and
insisted on serving his time in a male, maximum security prison, what
accommodations are made for him and is he safe, or would he be safer in
a woman's prison?**

The answer is that it depends on the policy at the particular prison.
However, we can look at what is happening at Federal prisons as a
"model" of sorts to see how the country is trending.

Federal prisons currently use the default guidance of "biological sex"
to determine where to house and how to treat prisoners. Prisons always
have the option to make decisions to \"consider the health and safety of
the transgender inmate, exploring options available to assist with
mitigating risk to the transgender offender\" and to always consider
inmate safety.

Inmate safety is an interesting topic, considering that, according to
the Bureau of Jail Statistics, about a third of transgender prisoners in
state, federal, and local jails have reported some sort of sexual
victimization in various surveys conducted from 2007 to 2012. In
contrast, a 2012 prison
[[survey](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3c1098&url=https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/svpjri1112.pdf){.external_link

sexual victimization rates of between 5 and 10 percent, depending on the
type of detention facility. All these numbers include victimization not
just by other inmates but by prison staff.[\[1\]](#SCYol){#cite-SCYol

No one group should be more or less entitled to safety in prison.
However, we cannot ignore the fact that transgender women are assaulted
far more frequently when they are incarcerated together with men. You
don't have to fully accept everything that trans prison reform advocates
say regarding how trans people are, or should be, treated in prison to
understand that no one should fear being assaulted in prison. And we
should all recognize the fact that the prison system bears the
responsibility for keeping *all* prisoners safe and free from abuse.

Prison policy should first and foremost focus on prisoner safety, and
yes, this should be above accommodating prisoners housing requests based
on their gender identity.
