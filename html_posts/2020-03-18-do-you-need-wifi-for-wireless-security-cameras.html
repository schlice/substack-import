**Do you need WiFi for wireless security cameras?**

In the vast majority of cases, yes you need at least one WiFi access
point or WiFi-enabled router in order to use most wireless security
cameras on the market today.

There are exceptions, however.

This is just one example of a wireless security camera system which does
not require WiFi to function.
