That's also because you don't have a clear, defined point to make, and
your point isn't backed up by any demonstrable facts. You also refuse to
partake in any reasoned debate about what "reasonable" and "sensible"
mean in relation to gun control, beyond "just ban them all" and why that
won't work.

Let me throw out two other phrases related to "just ban them all:"
Prohibition and The War On Drugs. Trying to ban alcohol and trying to
ban drugs did two things:

1.  Created massive black markets
2.  Increased total criminal activity, not just organized crime.

Now for the 64 Thousand Dollar Question (I just dated myself, didn't I):
If these two initiatives were such colossal failures, what leads you to
believe that banning guns won't do ***exactly the same thing?***
