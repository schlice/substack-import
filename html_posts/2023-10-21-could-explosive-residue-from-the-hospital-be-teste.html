Sure, it could.

But to what end? Who would do the testing? Why would we do such a thing?

We already have copious amounts of evidence to show that Hamas does this
regularly (attack their own compatriots in order to blame Israel) and
Israel never does this (indiscriminately bomb civilian facilities, even
when they know that they are being used to wage war).

The effort isn't worth the information it would yield.
