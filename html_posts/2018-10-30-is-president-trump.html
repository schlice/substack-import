**Is President Trump\'s proposed executive order to end birthright
citizenship, right before the 2018 midterm elections, his attempt to
change the narrative from white nationalist violence to energize and
anger his GOP base?**

In short, yes.

Although I disagree with "angering" his base, the move is definitely a
play to energize his base. I don't doubt that at all.
