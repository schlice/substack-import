**I don't have health insurance... I was diagnosed with M.S in 2008.
What are the best home remedies for the M.S hug? I've been getting it
more and more.**

The "MS hug" is a symptom of "neuropathic pain." It's a common pain
among MS patients where the nerves essentially "misfire" due to nerve
damage. There are two types: acute neuropathic pain, such as trigeminal
neualgia, Lhermette's sign, and the MS hug, and chronic neuropathic
pain, such as dysesthesia.

First and foremost, I want to suggest you contact your local chapter of
the National MS Society, because they can help you with treatment
options if you don't have insurance. MS Navigators are standing by to
help you find treatment. Please call them at 1--800--344--4867, or
[[contact them

The reason I want you to contact the Society for help is that
neuropathic pain is very difficult to treat on your own. It's not like
physical pain, which you can treat with analgesics or home remedies.
Neuropathic pain is pain which does not originate in the painful area,
but in the nerves which are supposed to just transmit the information
about the pain from the painful area to the brain. Treating the area
doesn't help as much. It can provide some relief, but treating the
misfiring nerves is more beneficial. For example, using a warm water
bottle pressed against your chest will change the feeling from one of
squeezing to one of warmth, but it will still be there.

While I hesitate to offer this as a potential help to you, partially
because it is still illegal at the federal level and only some states
allow its use for medical conditions, cannabis is an alternative to
expensive pain medicines. Cannabis is said to help relieve neuropathic
pain, but studies are limited, long-term effects are not well known, and
it's not approved by the FDA to treat anything. I only provide this
information because you said you don't have insurance, so expensive
narcotic pain medications will likely be out of reach for you, and
require the oversight of a doctor while using them.
