Actually, those are both untrue. You can bear fully automatic arms,
tanks and artillery. You must have special permission to do so, and
getting the investigations and tax stamps required to do so are not
cheap. Also, since ***new*** fully-automatic weapons cannot be
registered, there is a limited quantity of them available, which means
they too are quite expensive.

Also, there is no Constitutional restriction into owning nuclear
weapons. However, you will likely run afoul of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission's rules on storage and use of such devices. There are copious
regulations which you must follow, and you have to be certified in order
to be permitted to own actual fissile material. Fat chance that the NRC
will ever authorize anyone outside the DoE or DoD to ever own such
devices.

But as far as the Constitution is concerned, the plain language of the
Amendment does not prohibit those things. Either cost, complexity, or
government regulation does.
