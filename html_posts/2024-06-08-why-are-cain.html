It's actually really simple and easy to understand.

**Abel gave the best from his bounty** ***first*; Cain kept all his
bounty himself and gave the** ***overage*** **to God.**

Abel gave the best lamb he had first, and had faith that he would have a
bounty beyond that first, best lamb. Cain kept his entire harvest, and
only gave grain out of his abundance.

There is a distinct difference between how the two gave: Abel gave to
God **first**, *before* keeping any more for himself. Cain gave to God
**last**, *after* collecting his entire harvest. Abel's gift
demonstrated *faith* that God would provide even though he had given his
first, best lamb, and Cain's gift did not demonstrate this faith. The
Old Testament teaches the principle of *firstfruits* ([[Exodus
23:16](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=72715b&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/23/Exodus-23-16.html){.external_link

gave from the best of their crops, not the leftovers.

We can avoid going the way of Cain by *tithing*. Tithing is literally
giving 10% of your earnings to God, right off the top, before you take
for yourself. Give *first* and let God provide. If God is truly first,
we show it through our faithfulness in honoring the tithe to Him. We
sacrifice the first that He might bless the rest. And if you're saying,
"But I can't afford to tithe!" then understand that you will never be
able to afford to tithe until you tithe. We can always afford to give if
we give first. In other words, we may not be able to afford to give
everything we want, but we can always afford to give. It's all about
where you place your faith.
