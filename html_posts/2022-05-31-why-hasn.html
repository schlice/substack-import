Yet another reason why the 17th Amendment was so terrible.

The Senate was originally designed to represent the interests of the
states, while the House was designed to represent the interests of the
people. Those two interests are not always aligned.

Senators were originally appointed by the various state legislatures to
serve; they were not directly elected. Because all states are equally
sovereign, all states get two Senators, regardless of the size of the
state or its population. House representation is determined by both the
size of the state and its population.

Original question:

Why hasn't the Senate membership grown in proportion to the US
population?
