Charging does not cause jeopardy to attach.

In criminal cases, jeopardy attaches when a jury is sworn. In civil
cases, jeopardy attaches when the first witness is sworn.

If these things have not happened, then jeopardy has not attached, and
double jeopardy does not apply.

Original question:

Is it double jeopardy if I was charged for a misdemeanor theft first in
one court, then charged with a felony burglary in a superior court?
