What does **NOT** happen is you getting thrown back in jail. In fact,
this is illegal (and counter-productive, as you'll *definitely* not be
able to make payments if you're not working).

What will happen will be the same as if you miss a payment to any other
business to which you owe money. If you don't make a payment within 30
days of the due date, the delinquency can be reported to the credit
reporting agencies and negatively impact your credit score. They can
turn the delinquent account over to a collections agency, or they can
take you to small claims court and have your wages garnished.

What you should do is to call your bail bondsman and explain the
situation and work out a payment plan with them. Being honest with a
debtor is always better than simply not paying and not communicating.
