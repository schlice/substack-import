God may know everything before you even ask, but he wants to hear you
ask it. In other words, *he wants to hear it from you.*

Of course he knows everything, and he has seen everything. He knows what
you need before you even know what you need, let alone ask for it.

But he still wants you to ask.

He wants you to recognize what you need, recognize that he is the one
who can provide it for you, put your faith and trust in him, and ask
him.

It\'s not that he doesn\'t know. He just wants to hear you say it.

Original question:

If everything is already in God\'s plans, what\'s the point of praying?
