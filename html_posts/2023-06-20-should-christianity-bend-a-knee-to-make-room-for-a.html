It's almost like you, dear questioner, are thinking, "Gosh, Christianity
would be perfect if it weren't so Islamophobic." It's almost as if
people are so caught up in the multiculturalism of the day that they
forget that absolute truth exists.

While most religions have some beliefs that are true, not all religious
beliefs can be true because they are mutually exclusive---they teach
opposites. In other words, some religious beliefs must be wrong. But
you're not supposed to say that in America today. You're supposed to be
"tolerant" of all religious beliefs. And in our culture today, tolerance
no longer means to put up with something you believe to be false (after
all, you don't tolerate things you agree with). The new definition of
tolerance says that *you're supposed to accept every belief as true!*

In a religious context, this is known as **religious pluralism**, the
belief that all religions are true. This is wrong, for a number of
reasons.

1.  Since mutually exclusive religious beliefs cannot be true, it makes
    no sense to pretend that they are. In fact, on an individual level
    it can be *dangerous* to do so. If Christianity is true, then it's
    dangerous to your eternal destiny not to be a Christian. Likewise,
    if Islam is true, then it's dangerous to your eternal destiny not to
    be a Muslim.
2.  The claim that "you ought not question someone's religious beliefs"
    is itself a religious belief for pluralists. But this belief is just
    as exclusive and "intolerant" as any religious belief of a Christian
    or Muslim. In other words, pluralists think all non-pluralist
    beliefs are wrong. So pluralists are just as dogmatic and
    closed-minded as anyone else making truth claims in the public
    square. And they want everyone who disagrees with them to see things
    *their* way.
3.  The prohibition against questioning religious beliefs is also an
    absolute moral position. Why shouldn't we question religious
    beliefs? Would it be immoral to do so? And if so, by whose standard?
    Do pluralists have any good reasons supporting *their belief* that
    we ought not question religious beliefs, or is it just their own
    personal opinion that they want to impose on the rest of us? Unless
    they can give us good reasons for such a moral standard, why should
    we allow them to impose it on us? And why are pluralists trying to
    impose that moral position on us anyway? That's not very "tolerant"
    of them.
4.  The pluralist's claim that we ought not question religious beliefs
    is a derivative of the biblically-inaccurate prohibition against
    passing judgments. Before we even look at the Bible, the prohibition
    against judging is itself false because on its face, it fails to
    meet its own standard: "you ought not judge" is itself a judgment.
    Pluralists frequently misinterpret Jesus' comments on judging found
    in Matthew 7:1-5. Jesus did not prohibit judging as such, only
    judging hypocritically, or judging wrongly. Indeed, everyone (the
    pluralist, the Christian, the atheist, the agnostic) makes
    judgments. So the issue isn't whether or not we make judgments, but
    whether or not we make the *right* judgments.
5.  The Bible **commands** Christians to question religious beliefs (cf
    Deuteronomy 13:1-5; 1 John 4:1; Galatians 1:8; 2 Corinthians 11:13).
    Since Christians have a religious belief that they ought to question
    religious beliefs, then pluralists, **according to their own
    standard**, should accept this Christian belief as well. But of
    course they do not. Ironically, pluralists (the advocates of the new
    tolerance) are not really tolerant at all. They only "tolerate"
    those who already agree with them, which by anyone's definition is
    not tolerance.
6.  Are pluralists ready to accept as true the religious beliefs of
    Muslim terrorists---especially when those beliefs say that all
    non-Muslims (including pluralists) should be killed? Are they ready
    to accept as true the religious beliefs of those who believe in
    child sacrifice or other heinous acts? I certainly hope not. On that
    note, do Muslims fully accommodate Christians? Hardly. They believe
    that Christians are *infidels* (their word). If they don't
    accommodate us, could they be said to be *Christianophobic*? Why are
    Christians expected to be better than Muslims in that regard?

While we should *respect* the rights of others to believe what they
want, we are foolish, and maybe even unloving, to *tacitly accept* every
religious belief as true. Why is this unloving? Because *if*
Christianity is true, then it would be unloving to suggest to anyone
that their opposing religious beliefs are true as well. Affirming such
error might keep them on the road to eternal separation from God.

**Instead, if Christianity is true, we ought to kindly tell them the
truth because only the truth can set them free.**
