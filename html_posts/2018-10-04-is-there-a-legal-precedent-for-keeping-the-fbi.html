**Is there a legal precedent for keeping the FBI\'s report on Kavanaugh
from the public?**

Yes. It's not really a "report," but it's a background investigation.

It's a "supplemental" background investigation, in that it supplements
other background investigations.

As such, it contains personal and confidential information about a
person. Additionally, it contains information gleaned from other people.
There are so many privacy concerns, therefore, that it's unlikely that
the information from a background check will ever be released to the
public while the subjects are still alive. You will likely see a summary
of what's found (and I'm certain that Senators will be happy to put
their spin on what they read), but the actual documents themselves will
likely remain unreleased.
