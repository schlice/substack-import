**Is it ethical to have video surveillance on your private property and
not tell your friends when they are visiting?**

Ethics and morals refer to different things.

**Ethics** refer to rules provided by an external source, like codes of
conduct in workplaces or principles in religions. **Morals** refer to an
individual\'s own principles regarding right and wrong.

So, is it ethical to have video surveillance in your house and not tell
your visitors? In the vast majority of states in the US, it is not
illegal to use video surveillance in your home without telling visitors.
So long as you are following the law and only recording common areas
without recording audio, it\'s perfectly ethical.
