**Since the Supreme Court has remanded an Oregon case involving a same
sex wedding cake and a similar case recently, what can be concluded
about the original 2018 decision? Will it be reversed or further
narrowed in light of the new cases?**

From your own Wikipedia link (emphasis mine):

Essentially, the Oregon Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal from
the Oregon Court of Appeals, which ruled against Aaron and Melissa
Klein, finding that they did discriminate in their decision to not bake
a cake for a same-sex wedding ceremony.

This SCOTUS ruling basically vacates the standing ruling by the Oregon
Court of Appeals, requiring them to hear the appeal in light of their
findings in the *Masterpiece* case. Essentially, SCOTUS is requiring OCA
to hear the appeal and consider the fact that the state may be acting
with anti-religious bias in its decision to fine the bakers for
exercising their religious preference.

I suspect that if OCA does not find evidence of religious bias in the
lower court's ruling, this case will be appealed again to SCOTUS, and
SCOTUS will rule exactly as they did in *Masterpiece*. However, I
suspect that OCA will view the vacating of their standing ruling as a
rebuke against the lower court's lack of finding of anti-religious bias,
and will admonish them to ensure an equal balance between civil rights
and religious rights.

If courts continue to discriminate against the free exercise of
religion, I suspect SCOTUS will eventually have to take another case so
that it can clarify the line between the free exercise of religion under
the 1st Amendment and discrimination under the Civil Rights Act, a line
which they have not clarified to date.
