The Hebrew word used in the Psalm is אֶשֶׁר, or *esher*, which literally
means either happy or blessed. Various translations render that word as
either "happy" or "blessed," but both translations are correct.

But being happy or blessed to smash babies against rocks seems like an
odd thing to have as part of God's word, doesn't it?

That's why *context matters*. **For text, without context, is just
pretext.** And the most important context: ***Psalm 137 wasn't spoken by
God.***

Psalm 137:9 is probably one of the most quoted verses of the Bible, and
equally as often misunderstood. This psalm is known as an
\"imprecatory\" psalm. Imprecatory psalms were written as prayers
begging for God's intercession in a specific, negative way against
Israel's enemies. In this case, it was the Babylonians.

This particular psalm was written by an Israelite, who was captured by
Babylon. In his anger, he prays for Babylon to experience exactly the
same thing that Israel had happen to them when they were conquered.
Smashing the heads of little babies against rocks was a common
occurrence during conquest.

But what's important about his prayer is that he is not asking God to do
this in order to "get revenge" against the Babylonians. He's also not
providing ***direction*** for anyone to go carry this out (so it's not
like he's condoning smashing babies' heads). He's actually just speaking
his frustration and leaving it for God to take the vengeance. While the
Bible does discuss not taking vengeance yourself and leaving it to God
(see Proverbs 19:11 and Romans 12:19), the Bible does encourage people
to pray that God's justice be done (see Psalm 7:6 and Revelation 6:10).
You might also be surprised to find out that the Bible does predict that
what Babylon did to Israel will indeed come back around on them (see
Jeremiah 25:14).

The most important takeaway here is that even throughout the imprecatory
psalms, there is no hint of vengeance; it's always a plea for God to
take His vengeance in His time.
