**Content:** [Also, the plane is still \"flying\" even after it touches
down. The control surfaces still work after the wheels have touched
down, so the pilot uses the control yoke to keep the aircraft in the
correct attitude until the airspeed/ground speed has reduced enough that
the wings no longer produce lift.\
\
In lighter aircraft (gliders, for example), the wings produce so much
lift that in a decent headwind (like 10 knots), they continue to produce
lift even after the aircraft has come to a complete stop. We could
balance a glider on its one wheel after it had come to a complete stop
just using the ailerons.]{.rendered_qtext}
