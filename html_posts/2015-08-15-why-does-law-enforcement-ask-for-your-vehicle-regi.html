**Content:** [As far as the police are concerned, the paper registration
copy is indeed a holdover from times when officers did not have
immediate in-car access to the DMV\'s entire database. However, as with
most things, the law hasn\'t caught up with the technology, and the law
in almost all states still requires that drivers carry their
state-issued registration paperwork in the car.\
\
However, to expound a little bit, there are still organizations that may
need to see your registration that don\'t have access to DMV systems.
For example, if you want to get a visitor\'s pass to a military base,
they don\'t have access to DMV records like police do. So there are
still other organizations who may need to see your registration and
don\'t have access to it. State law can still mandate your possession of
it in the car.]{.rendered_qtext}
