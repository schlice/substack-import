The Bible is replete with references about homosexual behavior (all
quotes from NIV):

> Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman; that
> is detestable. --- Leviticus 18:22
>
> If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman,
> both of them have done what is detestable. They are to be put to
> death; their blood will be on their own heads. --- Leviticus 20:13
>
> Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of
> God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters
> nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men nor thieves nor the
> greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the
> kingdom of God. --- 1 Corinthians 6:9-10
>
> We also know that the law is made not for the righteous but for
> lawbreakers and rebels, the ungodly and sinful, the unholy and
> irreligious, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for
> murderers, for the sexually immoral, for those practicing
> homosexuality, for slave traders and liars and perjurers---and for
> whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine --- 1 Timothy 1:9-10

And lest you think that only gay men are implicated in the Bible,
lesbians are also specifically called out:

> Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their
> women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. In the
> same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were
> inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with
> other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.
> --- Romans 1:26--27

Jesus didn't need to say anything. Everyone knew what was detestable.
