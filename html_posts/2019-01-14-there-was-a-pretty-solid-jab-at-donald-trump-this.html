**There was a pretty solid jab at Donald Trump this week, and a subtle
one on Family Guy if you watch closely. Is the media turning against the
President?**

It's pretty funny that you think the media is *just now* turning against
the President.

You do know that the media and entertainment industry is largely
dominated by left-leaning individuals, right?

This isn't anything new, or at least it shouldn't be new to you. Donald
Trump's presidency merely highlighted the media's bias.
