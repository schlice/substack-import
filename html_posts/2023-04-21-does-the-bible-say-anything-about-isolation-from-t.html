Yes, it says that you shouldn't isolate.

*But! But! Jesus went off alone and prayed! But Jesus often withdrew to
lonely places and prayed (Luke 5:16 NIV).*

Yes, this is true. But this is just text, **and text, without context,
is just pretext.**

Look closer at the rest of this chapter:

> While Jesus was in one of the towns, a man came along who was covered
> with leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he fell with his face to the ground

>
> Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing," he

> Then Jesus ordered him, "Don't tell anyone, but go, show yourself to

So why did Jesus withdraw to lonely places to pray? The Bible says that
it was because "crowds of people came to be healed of their sicknesses,"
not necessarily because praying by yourself is the only way to pray.

It is also true that Jesus spent 40 days alone in the desert. Matthew 4
describes Jesus' time in the desert, fasting and praying for 40 days.

But after each time of solitude, of fasting and prayer, Jesus came back
to witness and to disciple and to be with His friends and brothers.

**This is the lesson to take away from this story.**

If you want to isolate and pray, do it. *But do not do it permanently.*
Take your time to fast and pray, but then return to normal life with
other people. "For where two or three are gathered together in my name,
there am I in the midst of them." (Matthew 18:20 NIV)
