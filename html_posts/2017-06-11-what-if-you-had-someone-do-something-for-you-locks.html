In general, if a tradesman agrees to perform a service for you, you have
entered into contract with them. It may be a verbal contract, it may be
a written contract (which most do these days, but they usually call it a
"work order"), but it is a contract nonetheless.

If the work is completed and you then refuse to pay onsite, most
tradesmen will say okay, leave and then bill you for the service. If you
refuse to pay the bill, they will either send it to their collection
agency, or they will file a lawsuit under your jurisdiction's "theft of
service" laws. You would have to show that they did not complete the
agreed-upon work, in good faith, otherwise you would be obligated to
pay, and the court would see to that.
