"High-end" describes the technology, and "flagship" describes a
marketing strategy.

"High-end" devices have some of the newest technology in them, and
generally some of the priciest. Most postpaid customers will be provided
with high-end devices. Devices which are not "high-end" devices may have
older, previous-generation, or lower-quality technology in them, built
for a lower price-point. MVNO devices or pre-paid devices often fall
into this "not-high-end" category.

"Flagship" devices showcase a carrier's technology offerings. When a
carrier decides on a "flagship" device, they devote marketing dollars
(advertising, signage, commercials, etc) to the sale of that device.

Note that a "flagship" device will virtually always be a "high-end"
device, but not all "high-end" devices are a carrier's "flagship"
device. Carriers may carry a number of "high-end" devices, but generally
only one from each manufacturer will be the "flagship" device.

Example: Samsung invested heavily in making the Note 7 the "flagship"
device for their GALAXY line of phones. While the GALAXY S7 is still a
high-end device, the Note 7 was the flagship device. Until it started
exploding.
