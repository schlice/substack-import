In 1993 I got a 1989 Ford Thunderbird SC as a gift. It was purchased
from auction.

This car had the supercharged and intercooled version of the Essex 3.8L
OHV V-6. Mine had the M5R2 5-speed gearbox, and was *Motor Trend's Car
of the Year* for 1989.

I was home on leave at the time (late November 1992), and so we decided
to take the car out for a speed test. We went down to Ocean Parkway,
which runs the length of the barrier beaches along Long Island's south
shore.

As you can see, it's pretty straight, pretty flat, and in the cold of
November, no one was expected to be on that stretch of road. So we took
the car down there, and opened it up.

At the same time, I was testing a used secondhand radar detector that
clipped over your rear view mirror.

When we were pulled over, the officer said he clocked us at 147 mph. The
radar detector didn't even blink. The officer even took his handheld
radar gun out of his car and blasted it directly at our rear view
mirror, and we got nothing. Oh well. I guess that detector was
secondhand for a reason.
