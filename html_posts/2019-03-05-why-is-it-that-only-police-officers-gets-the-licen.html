**Why is it that only police officers gets the license to kill anyone
they choose as long as they say \"I was afraid for my life?\" which is a
statement that cannot be disproven by anyone else?**

It is true that being in fear for one\'s life is a subjective
assessment.

However, being in fear for one\'s life must also have a reasonable
basis. It would be hard for anyone, police officers included, to see a
12 year old boy holding a lollipop, and claim that they were in fear for
their life. Therefore, the claim that being in fear for one\'s life can
be used as a universal defense and can never be refuted is simply
incorrect.

Additionally, being in fear for one\'s life is not unique to police
officers. Anyone can be in fear for their life. However, police officers
are definitely in that position more frequently than anyone else, so it
does appear to the outsider that police officers use that defense more
often than others.

And with the rise of individuals who are mentally unstable and seek to
kill police officers for the simple fact that they are police officers,
that defense seems to be used a lot more frequently than it used to be.
