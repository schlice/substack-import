**What are the chances chloroquine and Remdesivir will cure COVID 19?**

Zero.

These are most definitely not "cures" for COVID-19. A "cure" would be
something that completely kills the virus, or completely and with 100%
efficacy, immunizes us against it.

Chloroquine and some other drugs being tested (azithromycin, remdesivir,
etc) can "...alter the pH of the compartment in which some viruses are
brought into the cell. This can interfere with the process of depositing
the virus\' genome inside the cell and thus block the virus\' ability to
reproduce."[\[1\]](#rIvSK){#cite-rIvSK .citation_link}

At best, these drugs are antivirals in side-effect only. At best, these
drugs make it harder for the virus to replicate in the body, making it
less harmful and reducing the severity and duration of an infection, but
crucially, **they don't prevent you from becoming infected or
experiencing any symptoms**.

A "functional cure" would be something akin to a vaccine. These drugs
are most certainly not vaccines.
