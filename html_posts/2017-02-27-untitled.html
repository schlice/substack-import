*"guns have no place in an institute of learning."*

Tell that to the school shooters, who don't generally believe that.

In a college, students can choose to leave themselves defenseless*,* as
they are legally adults. In the military, we call that a "soft target."
Remember, shooters are not stupid. They may have warped values and
morals, but they are most definitely not stupid. You don't see shooters
shooting up a police station or a firing range, because those are "hard
targets."

However, our primary schools are a different story. Our children do not
have the option to leave themselves defenseless. It is our
responsibility to ***keep*** them safe while they are in our charge at
school.
