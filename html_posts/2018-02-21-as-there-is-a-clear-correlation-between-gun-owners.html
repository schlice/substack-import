Your question is based on inaccurate information. There is no clear
correlation between gun ownership and gun-related death. In fact,
exactly the opposite exists: there is an inverse relationship between
gun ownership and gun deaths.

It is an inverse relationship simply because there is no correlation
between **lawful** gun ownership and **crime**. None. Whatsoever. There
is no causal link between the number of firearms laws, the number of
firearms owned, the number of licensed concealed carriers, or any other
number related to lawful gun ownership, and crime.

Why?

Because **lawful gun owners don't commit crimes with their guns.**

If you have some evidence (not fake news stories) to prove your point,
please present it.

> ***What do you (Americans) think of abolishing the 2nd amendment?***

There is no political will to do so. There is no political will to do so
because Americans aren't about to dismantle our rights, rights that tens
of millions of Americans enjoy without committing any crimes whatsoever,
because of a few wing nuts going all nutty.
