**I accidentally signed up for Trump's campaign emails. How do I
unsubscribe?**

At the bottom of any marketing emails which comply with the CAN SPAM Act
should be an *Unsubscribe* link which you can follow to remove yourself
from the mailing list.

(EDIT) My comments section says that there are no unsubscribe links on
the bottom of Trump's campaign emails. If this is the case, and you did
not sign up for these messages, [[report them to the
FTC](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4d9b91&url=https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/%23/?pid%3DB){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="ftc.gov"}]{.qlink_container}.
