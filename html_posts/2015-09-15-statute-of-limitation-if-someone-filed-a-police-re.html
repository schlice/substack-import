**Content:** [Filing a police report doesn\'t really mean anything other
than that someone made an official on-the-record statement to police.\
\
Whether or not the police (and the DA) decide to pursue *criminal
charges* against that person is completely up to them.\
\
The statute of limitations is a time frame that is set on the police and
the prosecutor to bring charges against an individual. Statutes of
limitations are useful, as memories fade over time, and it simply isn\'t
fair or just to attempt to raise criminal charges against someone after
so much time has passed and recollections fade. The statute of
limitations starts the day of the alleged act, and expires X amount of
time from that date.\
\
In general, for criminal charges, if the person flees the state, the
statute of limitations is tolled (the clock is stopped) for that charge.
The person does not have to be aware of the charge in order for the
charge to be tolled. In general, a statute of limitations can be tolled
if:\

- Plaintiff is a minor.

- Plaintiff has been convicted of a felony and is imprisoned; a major
  component of the AEDPA.
- Defendant is in bankruptcy.
- Defendant is not physically present in a state.
- Filing of an action which is later voluntarily dismissed.
- Parties were engaged in good-faith negotiations to resolve the
  dispute.

There is another statute that provides limitations on filing suit,
called the ***statute of repose***. Certain lawsuit categories have a
statute of repose which bars the bringing of charges in certain
circumstances. For example, in product liability law, a particular
product may have a 10 year statute of repose (from the date of
manufacture), so a claim cannot be brought against the manufacturer
after 10 years since the date of manufacture, even if the statute of
limitations (from the date of the injury) has not expired.
