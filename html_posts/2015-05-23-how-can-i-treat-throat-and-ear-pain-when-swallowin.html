**Content:** [See a doctor.\
\
Throat and ear pain when swallowing can be caused by any number of
medical conditions. Most commonly, it is caused by sinus drainage
irritating the throat and similar drainage from the sinus cavities
through the eustachian tubes is also irritating.\
\
But there are a number of other conditions which can cause pain when
swallowing. I highly suggest visiting your doctor this week. If your
pain is accompanied by fever, chills, body aches, nausea or vomiting,
get to your doctor today, or visit your local urgent care if your
doctor\'s office doesn\'t have weekend hours. If none of those options
are available to you, go to the nearest ER for
treatment.]{.rendered_qtext}
