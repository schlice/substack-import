I have never heard of antidepressants killing neurons. SSRIs, or
"Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors" work by preventing serotonin
reabsorption into presynaptic cells, presumably making more serotonin
available for postsynaptic receptors to bind to. Killing the cells which
need to bind to serotonin would be contraindicated to help depression.
