Short answer: yes.

Longer answer: In 2003, the Youth Criminal Justice Act was passed by
Parliament. It says that the minimum age of **criminal culpability** in
the country is 12. This means, effectively, that a person under 12
cannot be charged with a crime. Those between 12 and 18 *can* be charged
with a crime, but deference is given to their age, and an emphasis on
rehabilitation over incarceration is given.

There is no national standard for youthful offenders (i.e. those below
age 12). It is therefore left to provincial guidelines. These are often
highly restricted, and grossly inadequate, as they cannot restrict the
liberty of the child, force the child to participate in his or her own
rehabilitation or obtain psychological treatment for any meaningful
length of time.

The Youth Criminal Justice Act recognizes that it is up to the community
to work with the justice system to prevent youth crime. They do this by
addressing the underlying causes of youth crime, and providing support
and guidance to communities.

But this is not perfect, and it is often incomplete and totally
unregulated. Most often, the youngest of the youthful offenders, the
ones who need the most intervention, are woefully underserved, and not
addressed by the law.

I just learned about a Canadian law called the Youth Criminal Justice
act, and it says that the minimum criminal responsibility age is 12, yet
does that mean that 11-year-olds can walk free without any criminal
responsibility?
