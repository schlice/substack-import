Gait problems are one of the most common movement symptoms of MS.
Walking trouble can be caused by a number of factors:

- Weakness. Muscle weakness occurs either through disuse, or nerve
  damage. Weakness in the leg muscles can lead to changes in normal
  walking stride, which can lead to pain, making walking even more
  challenging.
- Spasticity. Muscle tightness or twitching can affect walking.
- Balance. Balance problems typically produce a swaying, "drunk-like"
  walking pattern called *ataxia*.
- Sensory problems. Some people with MS have trouble feeling their feet
  on the floor, leading to challenges walking. This is also known as
  *sensory ataxia*.
- Fatigue. Fatigue, or *MS Lassitude*, can induce walking problems when
  it happens.

MS walking difficulties are usually most effectively treated through
physical therapy. You can also use appropriate assistive devices, and
there are some medications which can be used to treat either the
underlying symptoms above, or one specific medication (Ampyra) which can
treat walking speed. Ampyra, by the way, is the first medication
developed specifically to treat a symptom of MS.

If you are having difficulty walking due to MS, please talk to your
neurologist or your primary care doctor. They can help you develop a
strategy to improve your walking and to minimize the effects of the
symptoms.
