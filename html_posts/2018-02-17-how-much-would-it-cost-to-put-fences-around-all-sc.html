**How much would it cost to put fences around all schools in America? We
have this here in Israel, and there are virtually no school shootings
here even though terrorism is a major problem.**

Apples and oranges. Cultures are different in Israel, and clearly
terrorists do not consider schools to be high-value targets. Schools are
a big deal in America because of the nature of the **shooter**, not
because of the softness of the **target**.

In schools which have implemented security plans, you can only access
the school through one access-controlled choke point, and there is
security at that choke point. All other entrances to the school are
locked down. A fence just moves the perimeter further away from the
building.

Clearly though, some schools have yet to meet that standard. Only 30% of
schools in America have some form of armed security at the school, up
from 10% just a few years ago (but even then, as was the case in
Florida, the lone security guard never encountered the shooter).

Why don't 100% of schools in America have armed security guards? Why
aren't proper security measures being taken at schools? Does every
school district have a Chief Security Officer? Why not? Because clearly,
nearly three quarters of American schools are not taking security
seriously, even after Columbine, and even after Sandy Hook.

When, as parents, do we start demanding that our schools increase
security? Start getting yourselves onto School Boards, and start
becoming active in your school community, and start demanding your
schools implement some common-sense security.
