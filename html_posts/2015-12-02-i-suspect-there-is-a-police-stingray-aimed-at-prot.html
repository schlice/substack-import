1.  Make a phone call to someplace in Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Somalia, or
    any other country on the watch list.
2.  Tell the person on the other end that you intend on blowing up the
    protestors.
3.  See if the police arrest you.

Other than that, a stingray mimics a standard cell tower. It doesn\'t
look like an infrastructure cell (microcell) or a home cell (picocell),
which may display a different icon on your phone, depending on
manufacturer. Therefore, in most cases, you will never know that your
phone has connected to a stingray instead of a normal cell tower.
