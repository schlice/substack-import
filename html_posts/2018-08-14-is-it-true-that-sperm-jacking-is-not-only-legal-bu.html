**Is it true that sperm jacking is not only legal but the woman who
sperm jacks can be awarded child support?**

Sperm theft is technically not illegal.

If a woman spermjacks and then uses the sperm to get pregnant, she can
petition the court to seek child support payments from the father.

However, that's a double-edged sword. If she does this, openly declaring
in court that he is the father, he also has paternity rights. He gets to
be involved in the child's life as much or as little as he chooses (he
is the father, after all).

Granted, he did not choose to be a father, but he did participate in an
act which frequently results in children being produced, so such a thing
is not outside the realm of possibility. It's no more or less wrong than
a condom with an unintentional hole in it.
