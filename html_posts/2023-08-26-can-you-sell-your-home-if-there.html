Yes. Active lawsuits against the HOA do not remove its authority or
limit its ability to do its contractually mandated functions.

As always, this can vary by state, and there could be some state-level
limitation on the authority or function of an HOA during an active
lawsuit, but I am unaware of such a limitation.
