There is a particularly insidious deviation in the Christian community
called the "prosperity gospel."

The prosperity gospel is a doctrine in Protestant Christianity that
teaches that faith can bring health, wealth, and happiness into
believers\' lives. The prosperity gospel is also called prosperity
theology.

Adherents to the prosperity gospel believe that wealth is a sign of
God\'s blessing and that the poor are poor because of a lack of faith.
They also believe that faith, expressed through positive thoughts,
positive declarations, and donations to the church, can transcend
poverty and illness.

The prosperity gospel has its roots in the American occult tradition
called New Thought. It is a fast-growing movement associated with
Pentecostalism, evangelicalism, and charismatic Christianity. Some
notable prosperity gospel preachers are T.D. Jakes, Joel Osteen, Kenneth
Copeland, Oral Roberts, and Benny Hinn.

The prosperity gospel took root in the Pentecostal revivals of the
post-World War II years. Its popularity among American Christians has
boomed in recent years. It relies on the particular misunderstanding of
the book of Malachi

The prosperity gospel movement does make a few valid points. While the
love of money is indeed the root of all evil, we should also not
demonize success. Additionally, it is easier to make a positive
influence on society when you have disposable capital.

However, as you rightly noted, there is a valid and palpable difference
between "having wealth" and "idolizing money." Jesus explained just how
hard it is for people who idolize material wealth to enter heaven:

> It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for
> someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God. --- Mark 10:25 NIV
