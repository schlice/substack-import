<h2>Answer Comment</h2>
<div>

**Content:** [And this DOJ report you speak of says that all police
departments in the United States are structured around revenue
generation?\
\
Okay, maybe not all of them, but like most of them, right? Or half
maybe? I mean, it\'s gotta be a lot if you\'re this fired up about it.\
\
So seriously, how many departments are we talking about? And are these
big-city departments? Rural counties? Suburban departments? Any other
facts to give us other than \"all police departments are geared towards
revenue generation instead of public safety?\"\
\
Did you ever stop and think that, perhaps, the DOJ might just have
something to gain by slanting these reports in their favor, away from
local police? Stop and think about what the DOJ might be able to gain.\
\
If you can\'t, you might just be a Democrat.]{.rendered_qtext}
