**What are the existing mental health rules for purchasing a firearm in
the US? i.e. you are disqualified if x, y, or z.**

You need to have either been involuntarily committed to a mental
institution, or ruled by a judge to be a "mental defective."

After deinstitutionalization, the bar was set pretty high for judges to
actually involuntarily commit someone to a mental institution or place
that "mental defective" label on someone.
