No, law enforcement is not required to back off when they are met with
the threat of deadly force. They are allowed to stand their ground in
any state in which a civilian can stand their ground.

It does seem like there is increased scrutiny on law enforcement, as
they are somehow expected to "de-escalate" every situation which might
involve the threat of lethal force. That criticism does have some legs,
but it's not universal. Police can't de-escalate every situation.

So while there may be the *appearance* that civilians have more right to
stand their ground than law enforcement officers do, in *reality*, they
have the same rights.

Is the threshold of "Stand Your Ground" laws less than required for Law
Enforcement?
