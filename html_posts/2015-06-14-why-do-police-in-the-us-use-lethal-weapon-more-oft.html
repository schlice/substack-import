in great depth\

[[Why do American police always shoot to
kill?](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-American-police-always-shoot-to-kill)]{.qlink_container}\
[[Are police officers taught/trained to \"shoot to kill\" or to \"shoot
to
incapacitate\"?](https://www.quora.com/Are-police-officers-taught-trained-to-shoot-to-kill-or-to-shoot-to-incapacitate)]{.qlink_container}\
\
The distilled version:\
]{.rendered_qtext}

- A gun is deadly force. If you resort to your gun, it\'s because you
  are facing a situation in which lethal force is authorized.
- Police don\'t \"shoot to kill.\" Police \"shoot to stop the act.\"
  While it\'s true that death sometimes happens when people are shot,
  understand that death is not the goal. For example, if police shoot a
  person and he lives, did the officer fail to do his job? Not at all.
  Police shoot to stop the perpetrator from doing something which can
  cause great harm to the officer or the public.\
- A shot in the leg is not always non-fatal. You can hit the femoral
  artery which will cause death before the ambulance arrives through
  *exsanguination*, or \"bleeding out.\"

\
We have more guns per person in the US than in any other country in the
world. Having an unarmed police force makes no logical sense.
