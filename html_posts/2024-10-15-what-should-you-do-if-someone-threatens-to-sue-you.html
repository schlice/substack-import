I suggest you ignore it. But if you've never looked into civil defense
attorneys in your local area, you might just acquaint yourself with who
they are and where you can find their numbers so you can be prepared in
case you are sued. But don't fret about it until you actually *are*
sued.

Sure it's legal to threaten to sue someone. It's protected by the First
Amendment.

Should they have proof before they threaten you with a lawsuit? For
their sakes, they probably should, because if they go to hire an
attorney and they have no proof, boy are they going to look silly when
that attorney tells them to go kick rocks.

But no, they don't need proof to threaten to sue you, because they can
*say* whatever they want. It only makes a difference when they *do*
something.
