Parents cannot kick children out. That's a ridiculous notion. Parents
are literally legally responsible for their children until they turn 18.
Such parents will be arrested for child abuse and their children will be
placed with relatives or placed into the foster system. But I can
understand the concern about *abuse* at home for a kid coming out.
However, we need to balance that concern with the **data,** as well as
the rights of parents to care for all the needs of their children. If
parents are the ones legally responsible for the wellbeing of children,
then parents must have access to all the relevant information, despite
the risk.

Depression is much higher amongst LGBTQ youth than it is for
heterosexual youth. And "those who felt greater social support from
parents tended to have fewer depressive symptoms, whereas those who
reported greater psychological control from parents had more depressive
symptoms," as explained by Amy McCurdy, postdoctoral scholar at The
University of Texas at Austin. "For youth whose parents did not know
their LGBTQ identities, having a combination of high psychological
control and high social support from parents was linked with greater
depressive symptoms."[\[1\]](#LbeZs){#cite-LbeZs .citation_link}

In other words, studies show that **support from home decreases
depression.**

The new law you're referring to was introduced in California in March by
Rep. Bill Essayli, R-Riverside, and Assemblyman James Gallagher, R-Yuba
City. Essayli acknowledged the risk of abuse, but said teachers are
mandated reporters who should report abuse.

The real pull quote that answers the question comes from Essayli
himself: "That can't be the default position, that we're going to keep
parents in the dark because they might abuse their kids,"
