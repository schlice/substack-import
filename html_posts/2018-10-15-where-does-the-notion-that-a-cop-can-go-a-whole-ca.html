**Where does the notion that a cop can go a whole career without drawing
a gun except on the range come from?**

Your question is flawed. There is no notion that a cop can go a whole
career without drawing a gun except on the range.

There *is*, in fact, a notion that a cop can go a whole career without
***firing*** a gun except on the range. And it's more than just a
notion. It's provable fact, supported by statistics.

Cops routinely draw their firearms during the normal course of a career.
In some cities, it may be almost daily, maybe even multiple times in a
single shift. But it is fewer than 1% of police officers who will
actually fire their weapons outside of the range.
