**Content:** [Have you ever seen a law library? Guess what those books
are? Half of them are Federal and State laws, and the other half are
documented court cases which comprise the bulk of *case law*.\
\
There are volumes upon volumes of laws to read, so many in fact, that it
would be far too challenging to read them all.\
\
My advice: learn the generalities about US law. Take a civics class.
Learn how the government works, learn how the Constitution works. Learn
the differences between Federal and state laws.\
\
Then, when you have specific questions about laws, you can look those up
individually.]{.rendered_qtext}
