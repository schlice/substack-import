Ah, you've fallen into a very common trap.

When you follow this policy, you become a **permanent resident alien**.
This means you are allowed to live and work in Australia for as long as
you like.

**But you are not a citizen. Therefore, this is not an "immigration
policy" since you are not "immigrating" to Australia. You simply remain
in the country as a permanent resident alien.**

We have a similar program in the United States, commonly referred to as
a "green card." It constitutes permanent residency, but not citizenship.

Non-citizenship carries some weighty caveats. For example, if you commit
a crime while you are in a foreign country (i.e. a country that is not
the one which correlates to your citizenship), you can be **deported**
as part of your punishment. You may have come to the country on a green
card (or a 189 visa in Australia), but that doesn\'t make you a
***citizen****.*
