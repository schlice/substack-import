**No. Existing benefits will not be affected. No veterans will lose
benefits due to these cuts.**

Trump cut 1400 jobs, out of almost 500,000 employees at the VA. The 1400
who were cut by Trump were provisional employees who had been there less
than two years.

The announcement today of 80,000 employees to be cut was made by the VA,
not Trump or Musk. These cuts will return the VA to its 2019 staffing
levels of about 400,000 employees. These 80,000 employees were brought
onboard during the Biden administration, part of which were added under
the 2022 PACT Act, which expanded VA coverage to veterans who were
disabled due to exposure to toxic burn pits.

The VA Chief of Staff, Christopher Syrek, sent out a memo this morning
instructing top-level staff to prepare for an agency-wide reorganization
in August to "resize and tailor the workforce to the mission and revised
structure." It also calls for agency officials to work with the White
House's Department of Government Efficiency to "move out aggressively,
while taking a pragmatic and disciplined approach" to the Trump
administration's goals.

It is estimated that roughly 3.5 million veterans are now covered after
the PACT Act made exposure to toxic chemicals from burn pits, Agent
Orange, and other chemicals "presumptive service-connected." This makes
it easier for veterans who were exposed to such chemicals and who now
suffer medical conditions due to that exposure to get compensation and
care.
