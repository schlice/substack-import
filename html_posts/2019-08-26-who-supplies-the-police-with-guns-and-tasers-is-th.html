**What companies supply police and other small companies with their guns
and tasers?**

Every company which makes guns and Tasers supplies police and other
small companies with their wares.

Police departments can contract with any company to supply them with
guns and Tasers, so long as state law allows that department to do so.
There is no "approved list" in the United States, and even if there
were, it wouldn't apply at the state level. States can decide with whom
and how they perform those acquisitions.
