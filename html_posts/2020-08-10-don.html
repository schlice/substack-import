**Don\'t you think Trump should be investigated for claiming there\'s
voter fraud in vote by mail? He seems to know something about it or he
maybe contemplating to do it.**

No.

Last I checked, the First Amendment was still a thing. If you have
evidence that Trump has committed a crime, or will be committing a
crime, bring it to a Federal prosecutor. Otherwise, "contemplating" a
crime is not illegal.
