**Content:** [Depends on the jurisdiction, but codes 1, 2, and 3 dictate
how the vehicle is operating. Code 1 is standard driving, following all
traffic laws. Code 2 operates with lights on, and possibly bypassing
some traffic laws (such as speed laws). Code 3 is full lights and siren,
for situations that require expedited response.]{.rendered_qtext}
