As others have mentioned, you can visit the [[Academy
Admissions](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=60e33c&url=https://www.academyadmissions.com/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="academyadmissions.com"}]{.qlink_container} website to find
out everything you need to do in order to get in. Go there as soon as
you can; there are things you can do during your high school career that
will greatly benefit you before attending a service academy.

The website will also tell you what candidates have better success at
the Academy; look at those little notes as well. There are aids and
tools on the website to help you navigate the admissions process.

After you have visited the site, if you still have questions, let us
know!
