No, it is not possible for science to either prove or disprove the
existence of God. Since God exists outside of the universe He created,
He must necessarily be immaterial (since He is outside of the material
universe) and eternal (He is outside of time). So you can't use physical
tests to find a non-physical thing. It's like using a metal detector to
find a plastic cup, or using your multimeter to find your pulse. Science
is the wrong tool to do it.

This doesn't mean you can't prove God exists ***at all***, it just means
you can't use science to do it.
