I woke up one morning to find that I couldn\'t rub the sleep out of my
eye (it was blurry). Allergies, I thought. I took a shower and the
blurrines and pain got worse. Got out of the shower, and the pain
subsided somewhat. When I went into the closet to get dressed (i.e.
dark), I noticed sparklers (รก la the Fourth of July) around the
periphery of my field of vision. When I mentioned this to my wife, she
was very upset since eyes are very touchy with her; she has had bad eyes
since she was a teenager, I have had 20/15 vision my whole life.

She made me an appointment with her opthalmologist, and within the first
few sentences of my explanation, he knew what it was: retrobulbar optic
neuritis, a swelling of the optic nerve behind the eye. That particular
condition would right itself anywhere from 3 to 6 months. The more
nefarious question is what caused the condition. In almost 50% of
patients, there is no noticeable cause. In the rest, it\'s MS. To that
end, he told me to go to my GP and schedule a brain MRI.

I had my first brain MRI and went home. The doctor called me back the
same day. If you ever had a procedure and had the doctor call you back
the same day, it\'s usually not good. He told me that I should probably
get a neurologist, because my MRI showed all the signs of someone with
MS.

I saw the neurologist within two months of my MRI, and started Copaxone
within 5 months of my first visit. Why so long? At the time, MS was
diagnosed conclusively with two distinct symptoms disseminated by time
and space. Time separation meant anywhere from 4 to 6 months, and space
meant another body system affected. I had only one symptom (now called
Clinically Isolated Syndrome) and a positive MRI. So at the time, he
could only call it \"probable\" MS. Making the call to start the drug is
essentially \"admitting\" on paper that you have MS. This has
implications across the spectrum, including for things like buying life
insurance, so if you don\'t really have MS, it is not a decision to take
lightly. On the flip side, you can\'t regain nerve tissue once
destroyed, so the \"conservative\" approach is to \"conserve\" as much
nerve tissue as possible. After a great deal of prayer and discussion,
we decided to press ahead with treatment.

These days, you can have a clinically isolated symptom and a positive
MRI and have a full diagnosis of MS (of course, after ruling out
everything that can cause that symptom and the white spots on an MRI).
This attests to the power of the MRI as a diagnostic tool, and the
confidence of the medical community in it.
