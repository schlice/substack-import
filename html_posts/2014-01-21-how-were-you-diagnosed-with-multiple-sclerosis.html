<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I woke up one morning to find that I couldn\'t rub the sleep out of my<br>eye (it was blurry). Allergies, I thought. I took a shower and the<br>blurrines and pain got worse. Got out of the shower, and the pain<br>subsided somewhat. When I went into the closet to get dressed (i.e.<br>dark), I noticed sparklers (รก la the Fourth of July) around the<br>periphery of my field of vision. When I mentioned this to my wife, she<br>was very upset since eyes are very touchy with her; she has had bad eyes<br>since she was a teenager, I have had 20/15 vision my whole life.<br><br>She made me an appointment with her opthalmologist, and within the first<br>few sentences of my explanation, he knew what it was: retrobulbar optic<br>neuritis, a swelling of the optic nerve behind the eye. That particular<br>condition would right itself anywhere from 3 to 6 months. The more<br>nefarious question is what caused the condition. In almost 50% of<br>patients, there is no noticeable cause. In the rest, it\'s MS. To that<br>end, he told me to go to my GP and schedule a brain MRI.<br><br>I had my first brain MRI and went home. The doctor called me back the<br>same day. If you ever had a procedure and had the doctor call you back<br>the same day, it\'s usually not good. He told me that I should probably<br>get a neurologist, because my MRI showed all the signs of someone with<br>MS.<br><br>I saw the neurologist within two months of my MRI, and started Copaxone<br>within 5 months of my first visit. Why so long? At the time, MS was<br>diagnosed conclusively with two distinct symptoms disseminated by time<br>and space. Time separation meant anywhere from 4 to 6 months, and space<br>meant another body system affected. I had only one symptom (now called<br>Clinically Isolated Syndrome) and a positive MRI. So at the time, he<br>could only call it \"probable\" MS. Making the call to start the drug is<br>essentially \"admitting\" on paper that you have MS. This has<br>implications across the spectrum, including for things like buying life<br>insurance, so if you don\'t really have MS, it is not a decision to take<br>lightly. On the flip side, you can\'t regain nerve tissue once<br>destroyed, so the \"conservative\" approach is to \"conserve\" as much<br>nerve tissue as possible. After a great deal of prayer and discussion,<br>we decided to press ahead with treatment.<br><br>These days, you can have a clinically isolated symptom and a positive<br>MRI and have a full diagnosis of MS (of course, after ruling out<br>everything that can cause that symptom and the white spots on an MRI).<br>This attests to the power of the MRI as a diagnostic tool, and the<br>confidence of the medical community in it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
