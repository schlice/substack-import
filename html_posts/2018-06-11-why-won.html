Why would any legislature vote to destroy growth?

Doing so would be political suicide.

I'll literally pretend you didn't write this. Ignoring your marginally
xenophobic comment, no one moves to a state and "votes to destroy it."
It's like taking the gun and saying, "Gee, let me point this at my foot
and pull the trigger. Sounds like fun!" Literally no one does this.
Hyperbole much?
