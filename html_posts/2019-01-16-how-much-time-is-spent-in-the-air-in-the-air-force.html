Hi
[[Emily](https://www.quora.com/profile/Emily-Gleave)]{.qlink_container},
thanks for the A2A.

However, I don't have anything more to add other than what [[David
Saylock](https://www.quora.com/profile/David-Saylock)]{.qlink_container}
already said.

How much time you spend in the air depends entirely on your AFSC. This
is true for officers as well as enlisted personnel. However, even some
AFSCs that wouldn't normally be considered flying AFSCs can have some
airborne components. For example, as a Communications officer, most of
my assignments would be in a ground station, but some jobs could be as
part of an aircrew (such as on an airborne command center or on an
airborne electronic warfare or surveillance platform).

The majority of jobs in the Air Force are *support* jobs. They support
the Air Force mission: Fly, Fight, and Win.

Unless you're specifically in an aircrew, or in an airborne assignment,
your time will be on the ground (unless you're travelling someplace).
