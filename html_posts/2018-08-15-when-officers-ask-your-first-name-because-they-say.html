**When officers ask your first name because they say you look similar to
someone they\'re looking for, would the officer just assume it\'s your
name or would they fully identify you first before listing you as a
possible suspect on a report or complaint?**

They would indeed positively identify you if they are searching for
someone. The idea is to make sure you are not the person they are
looking for.

In most jurisdictions, you must identify yourself truthfully to law
enforcement. In most jurisdictions, failing to identify yourself
truthfully is its own offense, and if they believe that you are lying,
they can arrest you and they can hold you until you can be fully
identified.

Again, if they're looking for someone, and you're not the someone, it's
in your best interest to be truthful, not only so that they know you're
not the person they are looking for, but also because as I said, lying
about your identity is, in most jurisdictions, a crime in and of itself.
