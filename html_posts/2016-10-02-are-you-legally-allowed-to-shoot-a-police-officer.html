**No.**

There's really not much more to say than no, but if you want some level
of explanation, here's some:

1.  **You have no idea why the police officer is doing what he is
    doing.** Police have the legal authority to enforce the law, and to
    ensure the safety of the general public. When a police officer uses
    (or threatens to use) deadly force, it is because he is attempting
    to stop a threat to life or a threat to cause grave bodily harm.
    What is "grave bodily harm?" Here's an example: if someone punches
    you in the face so hard that he shatters your orbital socket, you
    could be blinded in that eye. That vision may return, or it may not.
    Nevertheless, this is considered "grave bodily harm" and any
    citizen, not just police, has the right to defend themselves against
    such harm. The police have the additional burden of defending
    society in general against that harm, and allowing such a person to
    continue constitutes an exigent threat against the public at large.
    You may not know this. You may only see a police officer and an
    unarmed man.
2.  As we have said numerous times here, **unarmed does not mean "not
    dangerous."** Unarmed people can inflict the "grave bodily harm" we
    spoke of in the previous bullet. For example, if a person is
    mentally unstable, he may cause great bodily harm, without thought
    for his own well-being, and doesn't need any weapon to do that.
    Also, if a person is under the influence of drugs, not only can he
    cause bodily harm, but depending on the drug, he could be entirely
    immune to pain control techniques, such as Tasers.
3.  Finally, **you have no authority to insert yourself into the
    police's job.** If you think you can do it better, feel free to pick
    up an application at the police station and fill it out. Don't think
    you can become Joe or Jane Vigilante and expect to get off. If you
    shoot a cop, **you** will be the focus of the investigation, not the
    person who the officer had in his own sights. Also, consider this:
    if the police are going to use deadly force, they have to be able to
    reasonably articulate an imminent threat to themselves or to the
    public. Whether or not their opinion is "reasonable" is a matter of
    fact which is determined by a court. Not you, not the public, not
    YouTubers. A court. If you size up a situation and determine that
    the officer is not reasonable in their belief that there is an
    imminent threat to the public, you are abrogating a duty of the
    court onto yourself, which in and of itself is not lawful. You have
    no legal authority to make decisions that are supposed to be made by
    a court, and you will be charged as an aggressor.

So if you see something like this happening, what should you do? I know
it seems like the "in" thing to do these days, but if you're there, and
you have your phone handy (and who doesn't), **take a video**. Turn the
video over to the local media when you're done. They will be sure to use
it to boost their ratings. Or, if you're more interested in seeing
justice done than seeing your video on the local news, turn your video
over to the District Attorney's office and let them investigate the
police.

Then put it on YouTube.
