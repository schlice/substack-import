They haven't nailed down an exact cause for these fires, but from past
experience, it might have something to do with the 75-year old power
infrastructure sparking fires.

(EDIT) Apparently, there have been some arrests for arson, but none of
them have been blamed as **the** cause of the fires.

Remember when California was turning off power over the summer? Yeah,
that was because they wanted to avoid starting fires.

So in all likelihood, the fires were sparked by old electrical equipment
(which is so old that some of it qualifies as national historical
landmarks).

Combine that with historically dry conditions and a state government
which can't seem to prioritize getting southern California aquifers and
reservoirs filled with water from northern California (which have
plenty), as well as forestry mismanagement thanks to liberal
environmentalist policies, in addition to local governments defunding
fire services in favor of DEI initiatives, and you have what we call a
**perfect storm**.
