Instead of bashing HOAs in general, I'm going to go out on a limb and
tell you exactly what you should do.

I'm assuming that you didn't paint the house in the first place. If you
painted the house without HOA approval, you're screwed. Just stop
reading here. If you didn't follow the HOA's rules regarding paint
colors when you painted the house, the HOA can fine you, put a lien on
your house if you don't pay, and then foreclose on your lien. If this is
the case, you'll want to find out what is cheaper: either paying for the
repaint, or paying for the fines. Do whichever is cheaper.

If you actually bought the house with that color on it, the HOA has a
really tough hill to climb to try to make you pay for it. You signed
your covenants with the house at that color, so the HOA (by allowing the
house to be sold with that color on it) tacitly approved the color. They
can't now come back and blame you for the color and force you to pay for
it or face fines.

They can either:

- pay for the repainting themselves (since it was their oversight that
  caused the house to be sold with the wrong color on it), or
- give you an unlimited waiver until such time as you can get the money
  to pay to paint the house yourself.

I don't know the laws in your area, nor do I know the agreements laid
out in your covenants. If you painted your house yourself, in violation
of your covenants, I'd talk to a lawyer, and start looking at how to pay
for it, since you could conceivably lose your house. If you didn't paint
the house, I'd start by talking to the HOA Board. They are homeowners in
your neighborhood too, so talking to them about this issue should help.
Advise them that they allowed the house to be sold with the wrong color
on it, so maybe they will work out a compromise on paying for the
repaint, or letting it go until you can afford it.

(EDIT) I learned that, as usual, this varies by state. Here in Florida,
the **buyer** is expected to inspect the home for HOA compliance
**before it is purchased**, find any items not in compliance, and
negotiate with the seller to repair those items, or the liability
**transfers to the new owner.**

I personally don't find that to be reasonable. In most cases, the HOA
doesn't even know when a violation exists. It would be an incredible
burden for a prospective home buyer to learn all of the HOA rules in a
prospective community and inspect a home against those rules. I'm not
even sure that home inspectors (which you hire before you buy a house)
would be able to find items on the exterior of the home which are not in
compliance with HOA rules. Nevertheless, that is the law in Florida.

So there are certain situations in which you may become liable for a bad
paint color which was not corrected prior to the previous homeowner
selling the home. Again, personally I find this highly unreasonable, but
I guess that's just me.

(EDIT 2) Some people seem to be intimating that by "color" the OP is
actually living in a house with *faded* paint. With modern paints, this
is usually unlikely, but if that's the case, this is a *maintenance*
issue. The homeowner is required to keep up the exterior look of the
house.

If the homeowner has a financial hardship, she should contact the HOA
and work something out. Perhaps the HOA can assist with soliciting
donations to a GoFundMe so she can paint her house, and neighbors can
contribute.

*We also have already fleshed out the fact that some people are okay
with HOAs and others hate them with a fiery passion. We get it. No
further need to add those "I would never live in an HOA community"
comments any further. We get it; you understand freedom better than the
rest of us plebes who are lorded over by our HOA overlords. Good for
you. Please don't comment about your greatness any more; I'm starting to
get a complex.*
