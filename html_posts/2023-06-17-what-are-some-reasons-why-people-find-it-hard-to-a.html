**Content:** []{.rendered_qtext}

Because to date, every "contradiction, error, and historical inaccuracy"
which has ever been "discovered" in the Bible is none of those.

Usually, they are simply misunderstandings of the Bible, the context of
the writing, or the understanding that the people hearing the Bible at
that time would take from the writing.
