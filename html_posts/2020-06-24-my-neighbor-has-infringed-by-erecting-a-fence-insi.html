**My neighbor has infringed, by erecting a fence, inside my residential
property line. What can I do, whom can I contact, to resolve this?**

You need to contact a lawyer in your area who deals with property law.

Basically, a survey will be done to determine the actual boundary lines
and whether or not (and how much) the neighbor's fence has encroached on
your property.

Your lawyer will present multiple options to the neighbor:

1.  They can purchase the land they took at fair market value and pay
    the legal fees to have the new property lines drawn, approved, and
    filed with the appropriate local jurisdiction
2.  They can remove the fence, at their expense, and erect it on their
    actual property line (depending on how close they are to the actual
    property line, this may not be a valid option)
3.  If all other means of resolving the dispute fail, you can pay to
    remove the portion of the fence which is on your property.

By the way, this kind of thing happens all the time. Normally, this only
happens when a construction project commences which has not been
properly surveyed before it was started. Pulling appropriate permits
from the regional building department where the properties are situated
usually addresses this issue, as the permits require inspectors to
ensure that land surveys have been done, property boundaries marked, and
construction follows the appropriate marked boundaries. Therefore, it's
also quite possible that the neighbor could face additional penalties if
he erected his fence without pulling proper permits beforehand.
