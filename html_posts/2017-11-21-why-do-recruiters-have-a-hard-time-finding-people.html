**Why do recruiters have a hard time finding people to join the
military? Aren't there thousands of Americans that desperately need a
job? I assume there are many that want to join but they aren't
qualified, like being overweight.**

Your question makes it seem like there are just *gobs* of military jobs
waiting to be filled, and "thousands of Americans that desperately need
a job," and ne'er the twain shall meet, save for some lacking in
personal motivation.

I know it's hard to believe, but getting into the military is not as
easy as walking in and signing up.

Here's just one example of just how difficult it is to get into the
military.

When my son was three, he had a birthday party at a gymnastics center.
Yeah, there's no way *that* could go wrong. He broke his arm in a break
that medical people will recognize right away as a *supracondular
fracture*. That night, he had surgery to pin and set the break, since it
was clean through his bone. But kids' bones at this age are more the
consistency of soap than bone, and one of the pins slipped out. So five
days later, he had a second surgery, where they removed the original two
pins, replaced it with three pins, and a new cast. He was a trooper
through the whole ordeal, and six weeks later, his pins came out. He's
had no recurring problems from his broken arm.

Fast-forward to the Air Force recruiting office. The medical review of
the incident revealed that *two surgeries on the same area is a chronic
condition* and is very likely a disqualifying condition, although it
would be close. It might possibly be waiverable. That, combined with the
fact that his father is a disabled veteran with *a disease caused by his
own military service* (oh, the irony) which ever-so-slightly increases
his risk of contracting the same disease, and he is disqualified. Can't
even sign on the dotted line.

Could he bounce to another service? Probably. We know the Army would
take him because he tried there once and they were willing, but they
refused to guarantee him the MOS that he wanted, even if it was in
writing. He could have gone over to Navy and applied there, but he's
*deflated*. He's been disillusioned. And I don't blame him one bit.

So in many cases, the lack of sufficient new recruits is a problem of
the military's own making, and in others, it's a lack of a *good fit*
between the candidate and the service. Military service isn't right for
everyone, and some people even learn this after they go to basic
training.

(EDIT) Since many of you are telling me that my son's condition
shouldn't have been disqualifying, I want to give you a quick update.

After speaking to the O-6 in charge of recruiting in the area, he
agreed. He also revealed a little bit of inside information: the NCO who
my son was working with was inventing reasons to decline people and then
*stealing their personal information* (which they then had in droves,
including copies of social security cards and passports) so that he
could sell it. Said NCO was arrested by military police and is awaiting
a court-martial. He can expect a long career turning big rocks into
little rocks at Leavenworth. The OIC told me to submit my son's packet
directly to him, and he would get it to a recruiter who was not a thief.

So as if it wasn't hard enough already to get into the military, then
you have to deal with this. No wonder we have a shortage of good people
in the military. They have to get through the gauntlet of bad people
guarding the door.
