To add to what [[Robert
Fowler](https://www.quora.com/profile/Robert-Fowler-9)]{.qlink_container}
said, offenses with a weapon should not be able to be used as plea
bargaining chips. Prosecutors should not be allowed to remove that
charge. If a weapon was found to be used, that charge must be applied.
Combine that with mandatory sentencing guidelines, and you have a recipe
for reducing crimes committed with weapons.
