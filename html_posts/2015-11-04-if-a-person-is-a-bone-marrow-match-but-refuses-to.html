None whatsoever. Donation is voluntary. Heck, registration in the bone
marrow registry is voluntary. If the sibling is not registered, you
cannot compel them to register either.

That said, there is a level of anonymity between donor and patient. If
they are utilizing the registry, the patient and donor remain anonymous
until long after the procedure is completed.
