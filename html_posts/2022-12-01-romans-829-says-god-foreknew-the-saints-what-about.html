So sometimes when you have a difficult passage (or you have a passage
that seems to defy logic) you have to look at the passage in *context*
to see what it's talking about.

**Because** ***text*** **without** ***context*** **is just**
***pretext*.**

So let's have a look at Romans 8:26--30 and see if the context aids us
in our understanding of this particular verse. And I'm also using the
NIV, which might be a bit easier to understand. I also highlighted verse
29:

> In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know
> what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us
> through wordless groans. And he who searches our hearts knows the mind
> of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for God's people in
> accordance with the will of God.
>
> And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who
> love him, who have been called according to his purpose. **For those
> God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his
> Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters.**
> And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also
> justified; those he justified, he also glorified.

Verse 29 is referring to the doctrine of election, wherein God *elects*
us to begin the path of salvation. Those He chooses are sometimes called
"the elect" or in some translations, "the saints."

When the passage says that God "foreknew the saints," it is saying that
God had already decided who was going to be elect, and called to
salvation.

The doctrine of election is sometimes a tough one to wrap your brain
around, because if God chooses *some*, it follows that God does not
choose *all.* It's clear that God does not choose everyone, because if
He did, then everyone would come to faith. God chooses us first, and
then, after we see His work in our lives, we choose Him. But His choice
is first. Without God's election, no one would ever come to faith.

> *Are there people whom God HIMSELF doesn\'t know whether they\'ll
> repent or not?*

Now that we have addressed the doctrine of election, we can answer this
part of your question.

God calls us first. He has predestined us to be called, and He calls us
by setting our hearts to a condition in which we can experience Him.
Then, after we see His work in our lives and feel His presence on our
hearts, we choose Him and he justifies us and begins the process of
sanctification.

It may be difficult to understand, but don't get it backwards. God
chooses us first, and then we choose Him. If God doesn't choose us, we
won't choose Him.
