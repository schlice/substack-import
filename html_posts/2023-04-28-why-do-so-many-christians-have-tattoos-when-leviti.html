First, the New Testament says nothing about whether a believer in Jesus
can get tattoos. So while we can't say that getting a tattoo is a sin,
there are some passages in the New Testament which apply, and a
Christian can reference them to understand whether or not getting that
tattoo might be sinful.

In other words, the tattoo itself may not be a sin, but the *motivation*
behind getting the tattoo may be.

> Do not let your adorning be external---the braiding of hair and the
> putting on of gold jewelry, or the clothing you wear--- but let your
> adorning be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable
> beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God's sight is very
> precious. --- 1 Peter 3:3--4 ESV

Peter talks about "external adorning." If it is done to draw attention
to oneself, that person may have a vain self-focus which is sinful.

> So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory
> of God. --- 1 Corinthians 10:31 ESV

Again, if the motivation behind getting your tattoo is not to glorify
God (i.e. the motivation is to *stand out*, or to *fit in*), then that
motivation might be sinful.

> Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal
> through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.
> --- 2 Corinthians 5:20 ESV

As "amabssadors of Christ," delivering the Gospel to the world, what
message does your tattoo deliver? Your tattoo should not deliver a
message that is contrary to the Gospel message you personally are
delivering.

> Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit
> within you, whom you have from God? You are not your own, for you were
> bought with a price. So glorify God in your body. --- 1 Corinthians
> 6:19--20 ESV

You've probably heard the "your body is a temple" quote before, but how
much of that temple should be altered? Is there a dividing line between
art and sinful mutilation when a person has a large number of tattoos on
their body? That answer is found when the believer engages in prayerful
consideration before adding that next tat.

\

Now, let's discuss Leviticus. 19:28 says:

> "Do not cut your bodies for the dead or put tattoo marks on
> yourselves. I am the Lord."

The rest of the passage does not talk about why we shouldn't tattoo
ourselves, but it is probably related to the pagan practice of tattoing
marks on themselves, sometimes with the name of their false god or some
idol. The fact that the verse says "I am the Lord" in relation to it
leads us to believe that this is what God is talking about. In saying "I
am the Lord," he is reminding them that they should not tattoo the names
of idols or false gods on their bodies, because only He deserves
worship.

While Christians are not bound by Levitical law, we can still take godly
principles from the ideas in the law, in that our tattoos should never
be to promote superstition or worldly idols.

So while getting a tattoo is not in itself a sin, a Christian should
fully understand the motivations behind the tattoo before getting one.
Christians should engage in prayerful consideration, thinking about all
the things we discussed, and ensuring that the motivation is right
before getting a tattoo.
