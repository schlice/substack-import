If your doctor has offered a preliminary diagnosis (not an allegation),
it will need to be confirmed through testing.

The main piece of diagnostic equipment we use to diagnose MS is the MRI.
A positive MRI along with symptoms is enough to meet the [[McDonald
Criteria](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9cdf98&url=https://mstrust.org.uk/a-z/mcdonald-criteria){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="mstrust.org.uk"}]{.qlink_container} to diagnose you with MS.

The McDonald Criteria is important. This is the standard your
neurologist will use to guide you through the diagnosis of MS, and to
order the appropriate tests. The criteria was published in 2001 by
Professor Ian McDonald, and it has been extensively used and revised
several times. It was most recently updated in 2017 to reflect our
growing confidence in the MRI as a descriptive and predictive diagnostic
tool.

Your doctor will use other testing to add to the body of evidence:

- Potentially, a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) can be ordered to look for
  fragments of the damaged nerve material. The LP is not necessary in
  all situations, but if other tests come back inconclusive, the LP can
  be ordered.
- Blood tests will be ordered to rule out the other possible causes for
  little white spots on an MRI (generally called the "little white spot
  panel")
- Evoked Potential tests, particularly Visual Evoked Potential, in order
  to assess the damage to the optic nerve which can be caused by MS (if
  vision issues are one of your symptoms, like mine were)
- Plus, of course, a full neurological exam and a patient history will
  also be taken

One more note about your last question:

> Do I have a say on the type of testing I should be performed?

You always have a say on what happens to you. Your neurologist should be
telling you the types of tests you need to diagnose MS, and why you need
them. Where options are available, you should be given those options.
But healthcare is a *cooperation* between you and your doctor. It is not
"one-sided."

But trust your neurologist to order you the correct tests to properly
diagnose what's going on with you. Some tests (like the MRI) will be
crucial for your diagnosis. Other tests are not absolutely necessary,
but may be needed to aid your diagnosis. If you are ever unsure about a
test, ask. Ask your neurologist why you are being ordered to take that
test, and what they hope to see in the results of that test.

MS is a difficult, life-changing diagnosis. As such, you should always
feel free to seek second opinions if you are unsure about your
diagnosis. We're all in this together.

If it's MS, don't worry, it's not the end of the world. Your world will
change, but it will not end. Plus, there are whole communities of MS
patients and caregivers all over the world who can help you. Even right
here on Quora, the [[Multiple Sclerosis
Forum](https://multiplesclerosisforum.quora.com/)]{.qlink_container}
exists for exactly this reason.

Good luck to you.
