**What do I need to spy on another cell phone?**

- You need physical access to the phone.
- You need to be able to unlock the phone.
- And you need a bunch of time to install spying software on the phone.

I think that's probably about as far as I can go with that answer,
before it becomes an instruction manual on how to spy on a cell phone.
From here on out, you need to learn how to become a good Google user to
learn what to do.

I would caution you though: spying on another cell phone is not only a
violation of privacy, it is most likely illegal.
