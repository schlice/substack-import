really nailed it. You\'re seeing more reports now because there are more
people with cameras recording things now.\
\
So let\'s look at the actual climate, and the ability for bad cops to be
able to \"get away with it\" (for lack of a better term). Do you think
that in this climate of \"cameras everywhere, even on the cop himself\"
that cops are **more** likely or **less** likely to engage in patently
illegal behavior, or behavior in violation of department policy?\
\
In today\'s society, it is far more difficult for a cop to do something
illegal and \"get away with it.\" So in actuality, cops are **less**
likely to engage in that type of behavior than just 10 years ago.\
\
But you see it **more**.\
\
The only logical explanation is that not only are there more cameras
around, but the attitude of the public, in general, towards law
enforcement has changed to an even more adversarial relationship than it
used to be. In other words, it\'s now even more of an \"us vs them\"
attitude than it was just 10 years ago. You can thank everyone from the
President on down for creating this current environment.\
\
Nevertheless, throughout all of it, law enforcement still has to do its
job, and still has to enforce the law. A thankless job has become twice
as thankless.\
\
One of the first things my training sergeant said was, \"If you want to
be loved, be a firefighter.\" Yep, he was right about that
one.]{.rendered_qtext}
