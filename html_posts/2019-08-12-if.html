**If \"Universal Background Checks\" were to be put in place, what would
that mean? Who would do them, what would they be looking for exactly and
how much would they cost?**

In the United States, you can buy firearms from one of two types of
individuals: people who buy and sell guns for a living (we'll call them
"dealers" for short), and from private individuals who happen to own at
least one gun and want to sell it to someone else.

Currently, if you buy a gun from a "dealer," you already get a
background check performed. If you buy a gun from a private individual,
in most states there is no requirement to perform a background check.

In 1994, it was estimated that 60% of firearms purchased were done
through a dealer. That means that 40% of firearms purchased were done
from private individuals. Those numbers are certain to have changed now,
but UBCs would only affect the 40% of firearms transfers which take
place outside of the dealer space.

If you implement "universal background checks," this means that every
time a gun changes hands from one person to another, a background check
must be performed. Every time, no exceptions.

So, now to the questions.

- **Who would do them?** Under the current system, only dealers have
  access to the background check system. Therefore, only a dealer can
  perform a background check. So today, if I (not a dealer) wants to
  sell you a gun, I just do it. You give me money, I give you gun.
  Simple. But if UBCs were implemented, if I want to sell you a gun, I
  have to find a dealer with a Federal Firearms License to perform a
  background check on you, for a separate fee (which is yet to be
  determined, of course). Once I receive word that you are not a
  prohibited person (well, on paper, that I'm certain I'll have to
  retain for a set number of years), then I can sell you a gun.\
  \
  Seems simple, but there has to be a reason that this wasn't already
  the law, right? We'll discuss that after we answer the questions.
- **What would they be looking for?** The background checks would be
  exactly the same as our current background checks look for, just for
  more transfer scenarios. They would be looking for felonies (since
  convicted felons can't own guns) and adjudicated mental deficiencies.
- **How much would they cost?** We don't know yet, because most FFLs
  wrap the cost of doing background checks into the cost of the firearm
  sale. Doing a solo background check without a firearms sale is a new
  class of transaction for which there is no set pricing. A FFL could
  charge \$5 or \$50 or \$100, we simply don't know how much it will add
  to the cost of purchasing a firearm. Will it price someone out of the
  market? Probably not, but does it make it harder for the poor
  (arguably the group which most needs firearms for self-defense) to
  afford a firearm? Yes it does. Doesn't this amount to unequal
  treatment under the law as defined by the 14th Amendment? Of course it
  does.

Now let's talk about the *practical implications* of this law that few
have thought about (or what are also called "the unintended
consequences"):

- I want to gift a rifle to my son. Does he need a background check?
- I want to give my firearms to my friend for safe storage because my
  house is under evacuation because of a natural disaster. Do I have to
  do a background check on my friend before he can take them? (BTW, this
  one isn't a hypothetical, it happened to me)
- If I'm at the range and I'm shooting with my friend (because I'm
  introducing him to the shooting sports), does he need a background
  check before he is allowed to pick up my gun?

Under a Universal Background Check law, all of these unintended
consequences become true and require background checks. Any exceptions
you place in the law become avenues for uncleared people to receive
firearms, so if the checks are to be truly "universal," they must cover
all transfer scenarios.

This, of course, makes the law unnecessarily burdensome to the
law-abiding gun owner, which therefore makes it unsuitable to accomplish
its intended purpose: to try to prevent criminals from receiving
firearms in violation of the law. The law only serves to punish people
for failing to follow it later on. So does that help us stop mass
shootings? Nope. It only helps us turn ordinary citizens into criminals
for failing to follow an administrative procedure. People are still
dead. There will just be more people to whom we can point fingers
afterwards.\
\
And when I sell you a gun, how long must I retain paperwork for? And if
the person I sell to does something illegal with the gun, are they going
to come after me because I sold it? And doesn't this create a *de facto*
gun registry, which is a violation of Federal law?

If you're going to make a law to restrict a Constitutional right, you
must do so in the ***least restrictive way possible*** to the
law-abiding, and your law must be ***sufficiently narrow*** to achieve
only your intended goal. Because UBCs are so unnecessarily burdensome to
the law-abiding citizen, and they do nothing to actually prevent crime
before it happens, they are unworkable.
