I love the ad. He shows that he knows what he's doing with a rifle, but
he didn't say he supported "universal" background checks in the ad. He
only said he supported "background checks so that terrorists can't get
their hands on one of these." This does not necessarily equate to
"universal" background checks.

Once again, as we have said a million and one times, every person who
has committed a mass shooting sans one has ***passed*** every background
check the government has thrown at them. Their guns were purchased
legally; no amount of additional background checks would have prevented
any mass shootings we have had in the US.

Perhaps he is worried about personal sales between people within the
same state, sometimes incorrectly referred to as the "gun show
loophole." First of all, it's not a loophole because that would mean
that someone is doing something within the confines of the law, but able
to achieve a goal outside the intent of the law. Private sales were
specifically allowed without background checks when NICS was
established. Private citizens do not have access to NICS, so it would
hamper all sorts of private transfers (including gifting and
bequeathing, which would be an unusual challenge in and of itself) if
you required every transaction to go through a background check. So
until the government expands NICS to the point where it can be publicly
accessible to anyone, having everyone do a background check every time
they do a personal firearms transaction is challenging at best.

Some states (i.e. Colorado) have already enacted rules requiring all
firearms transactions to go through a FFL dealer for a background
check[\[1\]](#DfYEh){#cite-DfYEh .citation_link}. Note that they have
specifically exempted gifting and bequeathing, but the law still has
problems. For example, during the fires and floods we experienced, guns
were transferred to family and friends for safe storage out of the
danger and/or evacuation zones. This is technically illegal under the
law. You can do a temporary transfer for under 72 hours, but that's it.
Local sheriffs have called the law "unenforceable," some refusing to
enforce the law at all. Of all of the investigations performed by CBI,
only 5% were for private party transfers. Clearly, we're not making an
impact.

Much like the 10-round magazine limitation (which just forces people to
drive to the State Line Store to purchase their PMAGs in Wyoming or
Nevada), the laws are just "feel-good" laws which have little to no
appreciable effect on criminal activity.[\[2\]](#IUWih){#cite-IUWih

So while it's great that he supports "background checks so terrorists
can't get guns," we already have those. What exactly does he support?
The ad doesn't say, and it's a bit of a sympathy-bait straw man.
Possibly an effective ad to gain support, but doesn't say anything of
real substance.
