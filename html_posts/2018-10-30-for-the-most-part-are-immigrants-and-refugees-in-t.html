**For the most part, are immigrants and refugees in the US contributing
members of society?**

You must be very careful when wording your questions. There is a
qualifier you forgot to add, and it's important because that qualifier
has been conflated with the word you used.

The question I will answer is:

**For the most part, are** ***legal*** **immigrants and refugees in the
US contributing members of society?**

The answer to this question is a resounding yes.

One of the best judges of societal contribution is reliance on state aid
(i.e. welfare programs like food, housing, and medical assistance). For
the most part, legal immigrants do not require large amounts of state
aid, while initially, most refugees do. However, those refugees by and
large become self-sufficient with time.

Secondly, legal immigrants, and for the most part, refugees, come to
this country in order to *make* a better life for themselves. They learn
the language. They start businesses. They send their kids to school.
They pay taxes. In short, they believe in the old ideal of the American
dream, and they also believe that you can make your own American dream
with hard work and determination. They want little to nothing handed to
them. They want to earn it themselves.
