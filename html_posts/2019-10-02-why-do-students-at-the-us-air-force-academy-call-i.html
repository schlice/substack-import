**Why do students at the US Air Force Academy call it \"The Zoo\"?**

I'm going to include an image that is unrelated in event, but is
perfectly related in location.

The cadets in the picture are taking part in an unrelated endeavor. I
don't want you to focus on them. Take a look between the base of the
chapel and the top of the wall, where all the people are looking down on
the cadets on the "terazzo."

This is known as the **chapel wall.** It is common place for tourists to
gather and "look down" on the entire Cadet Area. As a Graduate Docent, I
take tour groups to this location to describe the buildings and aircraft
displays in the Cadet Area as well as discussing its history and
construction. It's as close as the general public is allowed to get to
the Cadet Area.

Watching cadets march in Noon Meal formation is a really cool thing to
see, if you're a tourist up on the chapel wall.

It's less endearing if you're a cadet.

The whole experience kinda makes you feel like you're a zoo animal,
being observed by all the visitors to the zoo.

So we colloquially call it "the zoo." Please don't feed the cadets.
