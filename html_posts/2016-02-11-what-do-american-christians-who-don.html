You have two questions in here.

**What do American Christians think of British Christians?**

**What do Americans who don\'t like socialized medicine think of Britons
who love Socialist \[sic\] medicine?**

So let me answer the first because it\'s the easiest: *What do American
Christians think of British Christians?* Well, nothing in particular,
other than they happen to be Christians in a different part of the
world. I wonder if they face any unique struggles in the land where the
Church of England was born.

As for the second question, *What do Americans who don\'t like
socialized medicine think of Britons who love Socialist* \[sic\]
*medicine?* And I think part of your answer lies in your spelling error.
I consider myself somewhere between a conservative and a libertarian.
Therefore I\'m somewhere between small federal government and personal
freedoms are the order of the day. That said, I am no fan of socialism,
because it can never work in reality. It works on paper, where everyone
is perfect and all resources are abundant. However, any system would
work perfectly in those conditions (capitalism, socialism, fascism, and
communism).

*But we\'re not in those conditions.* We are imperfect people, in an
imperfect world, with limited resources. So you\'re actually comparing
*imperfect Capitalism* to *imperfect Socialism*, and under those
conditions, Socialism fails, every time, in every place in which it has
been tried.

Socialism promises Utopia and can\'t deliver. Neither can Capitalism,
but it\'s not promising anything.
