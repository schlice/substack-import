Radio waves can traverse through the ground. Assuming they are powerful
enough and at the appropriate frequency, they certainly can. For
example, we have a device known as ***ground-penetrating radar*** which
can see through soil. Radio waves of sufficient power and at the
appropriately low frequency can penetrate soil to fairly impressive
depths. Communicating through soil? Probably not. Those types of radio
signals are at a much higher frequency and probably won't get very far
through any dense material, soil included.

Most radio waves cannot penetrate solid rock. In general, for a radio to
work correctly (a traditional radio we are familiar with), you need
***line of sight*** between the sender and the receiver.
