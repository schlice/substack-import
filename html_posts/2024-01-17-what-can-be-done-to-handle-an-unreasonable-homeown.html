Homeowner's Associations (HOAs) routinely prohibit changes in the
neighborhood. That's because this is how they are designed. HOAs are
designed to maintain a consistent look and feel in the neighborhood. For
example, if all of your houses in your neighborhood are "beach coastal"
design and you want to change your garage door to a faux wood look in
the craftsman style, the HOA would deny that, because it would be out of
place.

And when it comes to architectural approvals, the HOA has the final say,
and it is solely based on their opinion of what looks good and what
aesthetically matches the rest of the neighborhood

But you said that the HOA's prohibitions are "unreasonable." That's a
subjective judgement, not an objective standards-based judgement.

So, what to do? Here's what I would do:

- First, make sure that their decisions are truly unreasonable, by
  making sure that you have a good understanding of reasonableness. When
  it comes to approvals, what is reasonable? What makes a particular
  change reasonable or not?
- When it comes to *subjective* decisions (i.e. what looks good, what
  will match the neighborhood), you really don't have much wiggle room.
  The HOA makes those decisions, you do not.
- When it comes to *objective* decisions (i.e. not based on looks, but
  based on restrictions in the Governing Documents), this is where you
  may have some room to object. For example, let's say the HOA says you
  can't put up a bird feeder. You've been over your Governing Documents
  and you can't see anything in there prohibiting bird feeders. You may
  have a valid objection. In this case, write a letter to your HOA
  explaining your objection to their decision.
- Finally, if you really believe the HOA is being unreasonable and they
  are threatening to fine you (or they have fined you), perhaps it's
  time to get one of those free consultations from a real estate
  attorney in your area who specializes in HOA law. You may be able to
  either send a lawyer letter to the HOA or perhaps if it's bad enough,
  you could file a lawsuit to compel their action.
