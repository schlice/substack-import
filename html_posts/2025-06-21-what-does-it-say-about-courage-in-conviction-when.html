Actually, it says more about the person asking the question rather than
the people described.

It's a logical fallacy (or at the very least, a great
oversimplification) to deal in absolutes.

*(Never mind the fact that this statement is an absolute in itself,
because we digress...)*

Atheists may "consistently" stand for their "beliefs," but they are
quite confused. When they "consistently stand" for their belief, it is
usually the fact that they ***don't believe in a god.***

That's fine, but they don't recognize that **this is actually a
belief.** Believing that you do not believe a god exists is, in itself,
a belief. You believe in the truth of that belief.

So when I (as a Christian apologist) points out that they actually have
a belief, they "consistently" argue that they have no belief. Confusion.

Know what else atheists have? **saints.** Saints are people who were
important leaders in their religion that have died but are remembered
for their contributions. Atheism has these: Christopher Hitchens, Carl
Sagan, George Carlin (?), etc.

Know what else atheists have? Here's a list.

- **Preachers.** Preachers are people who stand on the stage and deliver
  a message to those with similar beliefs. Atheism has these: Richard
  Dawkins, Sam Harris, Matt Dillahunty, etc.
- **Core texts.** Core texts (which are sacred or holy in theistic
  religions) are books or literature written by man that claims to tell
  its readers important truths about their beliefs. Atheists most
  definitely have these: *The God Delusion, God is Not Great, The End of
  Faith,* etc*.*
- **Blasphemy.** Blasphemy would be acts or statements that are so
  offensive to their religion that they might cause emotion or anger in
  the listener. To see if blasphemy exists in atheism, try this: tell an
  atheist that God exists, and if the atheist is emotional or upset at
  hearing this, does that not imply the atheist feels he is being
  blasphemed against?
- **Apologetics.** The definition of apologetics is "debate and
  argumentation that attempts to defend a religious belief against
  attack." There\'s a reason all the atheists are about to swarm the
  comments section: *to defend their religious beliefs*. If they truly
  believe in nothing (if they truly have a lack of belief in god), then
  there is no reason to defend nothing. Definitionally, "nothing" needs
  no defense, as it doesn't exist. A lack of belief does not need to be
  defended. Me blathering on about nothing shouldn't even be noteworthy.
  It should be nothing worth commenting on. So by responding, atheists,
  you are demonstrating the presence of something which is worthy of
  defense. And that can't be "nothing."

And finally, they have:

- **Churches!** Church is traditionally defined as a building (I went to
  church), but as was demonstrated during Covid, the church clearly
  identified that it is not a building, but a collection of like-minded
  people with similar beliefs. Do not atheists have this? American
  Atheists? Atheist Alliance International? Freedom From Religion
  Foundation? Do not these organizations meet periodically to discuss
  insights about their beliefs? Sounds a lot like a non-theistic church
  to me.

But let's get back to your absolutes point. **Atheists can have**
***degrees of belief*** **just as theists can.** Not all atheists follow
atheism religiously, just as not all theists follow theism religiously.
For example, just as some Christians might not go to church, listen to
pastors, or know the Bible very well, they can still be somewhat
religious, or even not religious at all, while still believing in the
core philosophy of their religion. In fact, people tell me all the time
that they are Christian while either not acting like a Christian, or
*even while holding non-Christian beliefs.* In precisely the same way,
an atheist may not know anything about important and influential atheist
figures, or associate with atheist organizations, or go out seeking to
engage in debate or apologetics about atheism, and still just hold a
quiet and private belief that God does not exist.

So your points about how atheists consistently stand firm for their
beliefs, but many self-proclaimed Christians often run from or are
offended by basic theological questions is simply incorrect, on both
fronts. I personally believe atheism is a non-theistic religion. We both
have religion, but we have different objects of our belief.
