Wow, the other answers on here are just...wow.

Trump will likely do a little blaming of past administrations for
failing to secure the borders adequately (which wouldn't be far from the
truth), but his use of Twitter has never taken more than a few seconds
of his time.

If another 9/11 magnitude attack happens on US shores, you can expect
the full might of the US military to be unleashed on the person, agency,
or government (perhaps all of the above) that claims responsibility for
the attack, harbors the attacker, or aids their cause.

If the cowardly organization does not claim responsibility, we will do
our best to figure out who did it, and then wipe them from the face of
the earth. You can expect a massive response, probably many times larger
than the original attack.
