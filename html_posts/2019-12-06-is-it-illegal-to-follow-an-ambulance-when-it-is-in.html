**Is it illegal to follow an ambulance when it is in route to an
emergency destination?**

Unless the ambulance proceeds down a road for which public access is not
granted, you are as free to drive on those roads as ambulances are.

You are not free to obstruct the ambulance as it proceeds down the road.

You are not free to interfere with the ambulance in any way.

You are not free to violate the speed limit (while the ambulance *may*,
depending on jurisdiction).

But given those limitations, if you have nothing better to do, you can
certainly follow an ambulance with its lights and siren on.
