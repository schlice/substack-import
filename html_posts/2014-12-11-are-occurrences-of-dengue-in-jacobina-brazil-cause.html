<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [As you correctly assume, there is no causal link.\<br>\<br>- Cases of dengue are rising.\<br>- Genetically modified mosquitoes which reduce dengue-carrying mosquito<br>populations have been released.\<br>\<br>THEREFORE,\<br>- Cases of dengue are rising because genetically modified mosquitoes<br>have been released.\<br>\<br>Students of logic know that this is a logical fallacy. There is no<br>causal link between the first two statements. Unless there is a causal<br>link between the mosquitoes and the increase in the incidence of dengue,<br>then it is illogical to assume that the genetically modified mosquitoes<br>are causing the increase in dengue.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
