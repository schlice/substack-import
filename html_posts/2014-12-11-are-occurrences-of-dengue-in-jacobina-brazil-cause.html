**Content:** [As you correctly assume, there is no causal link.\
\
- Cases of dengue are rising.\
- Genetically modified mosquitoes which reduce dengue-carrying mosquito
populations have been released.\
\
THEREFORE,\
- Cases of dengue are rising because genetically modified mosquitoes
have been released.\
\
Students of logic know that this is a logical fallacy. There is no
causal link between the first two statements. Unless there is a causal
link between the mosquitoes and the increase in the incidence of dengue,
then it is illogical to assume that the genetically modified mosquitoes
are causing the increase in dengue.]{.rendered_qtext}
