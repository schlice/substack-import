**Why shouldn\'t tourists be armed in the United States providing they
pass certain criteria? It seems perfectly fair to defend ourselves.**

In order to be able to purchase a gun, you must go through a background
check. If we have no information on you (i.e. you're a tourist), we
cannot perform an effective background check.

I should think that in this time of mass shooters in the United States,
you would agree that we should only allow gun sales to those we can be
sure qualify to possess one.
