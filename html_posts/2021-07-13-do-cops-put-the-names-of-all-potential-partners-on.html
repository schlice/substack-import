First of all, not all cops misuse the various criminal records
databases. Secondly, while the search itself is logged, we have no way
of knowing why the officer searched that particular person, or license
plate, or address or phone number. Finally, not all police departments
track this data, and others track some of the data but not others (i.e.
Florida reported that there were hundreds of unauthorized database
searches but did not report on whether or not the officers were
disciplined).

That said, we know that cops do misuse criminal records databases,
because FOIA requests for disciplinary actions against officers who
misused databases produced results. Without consistent record-keeping
and reporting of disciplinary actions across the more than 13,000 law
enforcement agencies across the United States, we probably won't get
very good answers as to how often and to what degree it
occurs.[\[1\]](#fGrCB){#cite-fGrCB .citation_link}
