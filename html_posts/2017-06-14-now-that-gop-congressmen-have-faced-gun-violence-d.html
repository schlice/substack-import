If, by gun control, you mean "using two hands," then I'd agree.

If, by gun control, you mean increasing laws so that lawful citizens
lose access to guns, then most assuredly no.

No one in their right minds believes that "yet another law" would stop a
crazed gunman. Because if the crazed gunman didn't have a gun, he'd use
a knife. Or a car. Or a bomb. Because he's *crazy*.
