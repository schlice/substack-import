Fogleman has my vote for the best. Dugan was a bit before my time, but
he comes in close second.

I had some of the worst experiences during the McPeak era, and not just
because he oversaw the drawdown that cost me a pilot\'s slot. The
uniform changes were ridiculous, downward-directed, and almost
universally hated. The whole Total Quality Management (TQM) movement
made the Air Force feel more like a civilian company rather than a
military. We felt like we were the red-headed stepchildren of the Armed
Forces under McPeak. Even Wikipedia has detailed the angst over the
McPeak years:

> McPeak\'s legacy as Chief of Staff has been considered in several
> quarters as one of the most controversial in U.S. Air Force history

> Guard, have accused him of trying to run the Air Force as a
> corporation, with his introduction of Total Quality Management (TQM)
> under the moniker of \"Quality Air Force\" (QAF), as well as the
> uniform changes he unilaterally implemented which strayed from a
> traditional land-based military style. Some of his uniform changes
> were soon undone after his retirement by his successor as USAF Chief
> of Staff.
