**Content:** [In order to have your anonymity removed, the court has to
know who it is issuing its subpoena for. Therefore, the subpoena can\'t
be for \"that anonymous user\" because it has to be written against an
individual.\
\
That said, the court has issued \"[[Doe
subpoena](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b1870b&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doe_subpoena){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}s\" in order to determine
the identity of anonymous posters. Quora will reveal your identity to
law enforcement should it be requested through a Doe subpoena.\
\
Try it. Make an anonymous post and click Submit. The pop-up that comes
up explains that while your anonymity is protected, Quora can figure out
who you are. Therefore, if they are technically able, and they comply
with court-ordered disclosure, they will do so if they are ordered to.\
\
If the service does not know who you are (i.e. an anonymous blog
comment), the Doe subpoena can get your IP address which can then be
resolved to a user through the ISP. The Doe subpoena can allow the
disclosure of this information.]{.rendered_qtext}
