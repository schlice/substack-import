Individuals are not saved through the process of sanctification.
Individuals are saved through the process of **salvation**.

What precedes salvation is a process called **regeneration.**
Regeneration is a sovereign work of God which prepares us for salvation.
*Regeneration precedes salvation because salvation is by faith, and dead
men cannot have faith. God, therefore, has mercy and imparts life.*

As for the second part of your question, yes, the saved are "set apart"
from the world. In other words, you are *in* the world, but you are not
*of* the world. You can be a light to the world (a conduit for Christ's
light) while not being *of* the world, or belonging to the world.

**This will cause you pain**. The world will reject you. The world will
hate you. It's not easy to be a Christian. *Salvation is free, but it
will cost you your life.*

But take heart, for Christ has overcome the world.

> this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the
> world." --- John 16:33 NIV
