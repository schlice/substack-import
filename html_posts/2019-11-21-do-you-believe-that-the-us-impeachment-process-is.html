**Do you believe that the U.S. impeachment process is flawed because
political motivations are permitted to exist within the process? Is
there any other process that you can think of that would reduce or
eliminate a potential political agenda?**

Unfortunately, no.

The Framers were actually very keenly aware that the impeachment process
could someday become political, since impeachment is necessarily a
political process, not a legal one.

What they did instead is to make the bar for *removal from office* very
high. You need a *supermajority* of Senators to remove a President from
office.

What this *should* tell you is that the Framers knew that the power to
pass Articles of Impeachment could be politicized (as we're seeing
today). You can tell that it's politicized because the desire to impeach
falls squarely along party lines. There's no consensus in Trump's case
(as we've had with every other impeachable offense) that an impeachable
offense has taken place.

Currently, the only remedy when a House politicizes the impeachment
process is to remove those Representatives at their next election.
