I happen to attend a church which did not have Christmas Day services.

We did this for two reasons.

1.  We had ***absolutely amazing*** Christmas Eve day services (two of
    them to accommodate everyone). Those services were full of amazing,
    moving and heartfelt worship, and great, convicting messages by our
    entire pastoral team. That service was enough to fill me for *two
    weeks*, let alone the one that it will.
2.  In our Saturday services, we were reminded that *in all we do, we
    are to worship God*. That means in opening presents, in sharing the
    day with our families, in going to work, in vacationing, everything.
    Do **everything** for the glory of God. You don't need to gather in
    a room to worship God. Everything you do should be in worship to
    God. So simply remembering that and doing it (the next day) should
    be sufficient. And spending quality time together with family is
    also very important, so we chose to not have Christmas Day services.

So as long as the message is delivered correctly, I think it's not only
possible to have no Christmas Day services, I think it can be
theologically and doctrinally acceptable.
