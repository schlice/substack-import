title: "In the Bible it states that God is with you when you walk the right path. But what about when you are on the wrong one? Does he/she leave you? What if you lose faith does he/she leave you then too? Does he/she pick and choose when to be beside you?"

I take it you've never heard "Footprints," have you?

God is always with you, whether you willingly walk beside Him, or
whether your path tends to stray away from His. He will always be there,
gently guiding you back on to His path for your life.

And what I've noticed through my handful of decades walking this walk is
that if you are obedient and you allow Him to guide your path, **your
walk becomes significantly easier.** The times in my life where I chose
to "make my own decisions" and "go it alone" without God's guidance and
wisdom have been the most challenging times in my life.

I'm not saying that all of our challenges are self-inflicted. What I am
saying is that if you let God lead you, He will lead you down a path
which will ultimately benefit you.

> "For I know the plans I have for you," declares the Lord,\
> "plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and
> a future." --- Jeremiah 29:11

Even God's plans may be a bit rocky, but if we persevere, His plans will
lead us to fullness.

I think of it as a tandem bike riding down a wooded path. We all tend to
want to be in the front, driving the bike, and we tend to want to put
God on the back. When we do this, we may initially prosper, but we may
end up going off of the path God has planned for us.

Until one day, we finally decide that we want God to lead the course of
our life, so we pull over and we say, "Okay God, you drive." He looks at
you and says, "Sit down, shut up, and hold on." Then He gets on the
front and starts going, *and suddenly veers the bike off of the path and
into the trees!* And you're flying down a hill, bumping and bouncing
like crazy, and you're literally doing the best you can to hold on. But
then, you emerge, and you break out into the most picturesque meadow you
have ever seen in your entire life (think postcard-style meadow).

And if you hadn't trusted God to drive, and endured the bumps along the
way, you never would have found this majestic place.

Our walk with God is similar. If you let Him lead, you certainly will
not go down the path you intended to go on. Your journey will be filled
with bumps and bounces. It will sometimes feel chaotic. **But you have
to trust God to bring you through it**. And when you do, it will be like
nothing you could ever have imagined.
