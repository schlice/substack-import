First, are you absolutely sure they are dead? If they went MIA (missing
in action), are you certain that they died? During the Vietnam War, Lt
Col Robinson Risner spent seven years in the \"Hanoi Hilton\". Howard
Rutledge was there for almost 7 1/2 years. I bet their families thought
they were dead. Or did they? Did they hold out hope that they were still
alive?

It is for this reason that families want to **know** the true status of
their loved ones. They want to be **sure.** It is a concept called
*closure*, being able to officially \"close\" that chapter of your life.
Closure is an integral part of the healing process. It allows the family
to know that their loved one is now \"at rest\" and is finally \"at
peace.\"

Also, there are several cultural and religious schools of thought which
teach that burial shows respect for the dead (as allowing the body to
remain exposed to scavengers is disrespectful to the dead in many
cultures). Many religions believe in an afterlife, and part of entry
into that afterlife includes proper interment.
