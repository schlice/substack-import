In California, you have the right to be free from "intrusion upon
seclusion" and "unwarranted and undesired publicity." This generally
means that people may not take photos or videos of you in a "private
place" without your consent. Whether a particular location is "private"
or "public" depends on whether or not you have a **reasonable
expectation of privacy** in that location. Note that the *legal*
definition of "reasonable expectation of privacy" may not match your
personal definition. But generally speaking, the inside of a house is
considered private and pretty much everything else is considered public.

If you are standing on private property inside of a fully fenced-in yard
with a minimum of a six foot privacy fence, and there are no neighboring
houses which can see into your yard, you may have a reasonable
expectation of privacy from someone standing on the ground level outside
of your fence. However, if you are in your front yard (still on your
private property) but you are fully visible to someone standing in a
public place (like the sidewalk), you do not have a reasonable
expectation of privacy. Your photograph can be taken without your
consent. Your photograph can even be posted online!

The one thing which cannot be done with your photo would be to *make
money*. If your photo is used for commercial purposes, consent must be
granted.

But other than that, the general rule of thumb is "if you can see it,
you can shoot it" (with a camera).
