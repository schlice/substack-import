So I can see that you're only looking for Old Testament references, but
you asked the question in a Christian space, and we believe the entire
Bible is the inerrant word of God as communicated through Biblical
writers. So I'll give you the answer, and you can determine if you think
the sources are credible or not.

And also to be fair, I grew up Catholic and went to Catholic high
school, but I have been out of the faith for most of my adult life. So
Catholics, please speak up if I misspeak.

First of all, the saints aren't **dead**, but they are alive in heaven.
"He is not the God of the dead, but of the living." (Mark 12:27) Hebrews
12:1 says we are "surrounded" by a "great cloud of witnesses." It's what
the Apostle's Creed calls the "communion of saints."

Secondly, Catholics do not **worship** the saints, but instead ask them
to pray on their behalf to God. They see God face to face. Why wouldn't
you ask them to pray for you? We ask others for prayers, why not ask the
saints for prayers also? Catholics pray to these saints and ask them to
intercede on their behalf to God.

Finally, **necromancy** is the practice of summoning forth spirits from
the underworld to converse with them and to gain secret knowledge.
Catholics certainly do not pray to spirits in the underworld, and they
most certainly are not trying to gain secret knowledge. Catholics pray
to saints in heaven and ask for intercessory prayer.

Original question:

Are Catholics necromancers? Doesn\'t the Bible say not to contact the
dead and even God\'s angels tell people not to bow or worship them. How
can dead saints be prayed to? Biblical sources not texts written 100s of
years after the apostles
