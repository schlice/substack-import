**Content:** [If there is a law in your jurisdiction that says that
public urination and public defecation is illegal (there is in most
jurisdictions) and the law specifies that for minors, the
parents/guardians receive the ticket, then there is nothing at all wrong
about it.\
\
For toddlers who are just learning to potty-train, sometimes they can\'t
make it to the bathroom in time. I get that. I\'ve been there. A police
officer has to make a judgment call about that situation. Is the
caregiver honestly trying to get the child to a bathroom and there is
simply none around (and the toddler \"can\'t hold it anymore\"), or do
they simply not care about the law and they let the child pee
wherever/whenever he wishes because he\'s a child?\
\
Are you asking if it\'s wrong-headed to have such laws? Normally, these
laws exist because of health/safety concerns. But the secondary concern
for non-toddlers is a charge of indecent exposure. Walking home drunk
and stopping to pee behind a tree and inadvertently exposing yourself to
someone could land you on the sex offender registry.]{.rendered_qtext}
