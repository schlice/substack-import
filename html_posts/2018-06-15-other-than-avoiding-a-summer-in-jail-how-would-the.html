**Other than avoiding a summer in jail, how would the effects of the
President pardoning Paul Manafort now in June 2018 be different than
those of pardoning him after his pending trials a few months later?**

As others have stated, the massive difference is whether or not Manafort
can be compelled to testify against Trump.

If Trump were to pardon Manafort now, Mueller could compel him to
testify against Trump, and Manafort would have no 5th Amendment
protections against self-incrimination, because he was officially
pardoned and cannot be convicted, even if he incriminates himself in his
testimony.

Since this would be, definitionally, *bad* for Trump, he won't do it.
He'll wait for the trial and any possible convictions, and *then* he
would consider a Presidential pardon. Most certainly not before.
