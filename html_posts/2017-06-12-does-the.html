As [[Matthew Park
Moore](https://www.quora.com/profile/Matthew-Park-Moore)]{.qlink_container}
explained, in general, Good Samaritan laws are designed to indemnify you
against lawsuits for what might happen if you cause more harm to someone
when attempting to assist in a life-threatening situation. For example,
if you pull someone from a burning car but they had a spinal injury and
become paralyzed as a result, you would generally be protected from
lawsuits seeking damages because you caused the paralysis.

There are, of course, limitations to that protection.

For example, if you work in a field in which you should know better
(i.e. you're a doctor), you are not covered under many states' Good
Samaritan laws (but hopefully you have medical malpractice insurance
that can protect you). Also, you have to be making a *good faith
attempt* to save the victim's life; the protection does not allow you to
be reckless or place the person in more danger than you found them (also
called gross negligence). Back to the burning car example, if you were
to drag the person to safety and leave them on the pavement in the
middle of a six-lane freeway, it could be argued that you were negligent
in your actions, and it doesn't take a rocket surgeon to figure that
out.

If, however, you are making a good faith attempt to help, you're not a
trained first responder, and something goes horribly wrong during your
attempt, you should be indemnified under most states' Good Samaritan
laws. Not all states are the same. Alabama only protects
medically-trained personnel. Oklahoma only protects non-trained
personnel if they are performing CPR or controlling bleeding; anything
else, and you risk a liability lawsuit.

However, before you stop to help at an accident scene, take the time to
review the Good Samaritan statutes in your state.

Also, bear in mind that there is never any liability involved if the
only thing you do is to be a good witness and call 911 to let the
professionals handle it.
