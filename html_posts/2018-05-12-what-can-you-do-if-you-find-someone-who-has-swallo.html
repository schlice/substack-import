So from your question details, you found the woman unconscious.

Once you have called the ambulance, cooperate with the 911 operator as
much as you can, trying to find out what she took and how much of it she
took. Is there a pill bottle nearby?

Then, start CPR. Is she breathing? Is her heart beating? Is her airway
obstructed?

Once those are taken care of, there's really not much more you can do.
The rest would have to be handled by a hospital.
