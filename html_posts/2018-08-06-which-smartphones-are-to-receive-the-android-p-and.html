**Which Smartphones are to receive the Android P (Android 9) update?**

It's still too early to tell exactly which devices **will** get Android
P later this month, or how long it will take manufacturers and then
carriers to roll it out.

There's a pretty extensive list of what devices have been planned to get
the Android P update over at AndroidPIT:

It's less of a choice of "which devices" will get the update, as most
modern Android devices should get it. The question is, of course,
"when."

We do know that Google devices will get it first. There is no doubt of
that. If you're on a Pixel, you'll be among the first users to get
Android P.

After that, it's really up to the carrier as to when they complete their
integration and roll-out plans.
