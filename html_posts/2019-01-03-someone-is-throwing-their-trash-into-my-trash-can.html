**Someone is throwing their trash into my trash can. Is this legal? Can
I file a police report?**

Technically, yes this is illegal, with caveats.

Most people in the United States pay for their own trash service, out of
their own paychecks. Therefore, someone using your trash can is
considered *theft of service.* In California, this would be considered a
petty offense; however, if this were to be a charged offense, since the
service in question costs less than \$50, the theft would be charged as
an infraction, and the thief would be fined no greater than \$250.

If you don't pay directly for your own trash services (i.e. perhaps your
town provides trash service out of everyone's taxes), it's at least
questionable whether or not you could personally consider this theft of
service.

But let's be honest with ourselves. You actually think the police will
make it out to your house before the service thief gets away? I doubt
it. And even if they do, they give the guy a stern talking-to, and he's
on his way.

It does sound like this guy is doing this because he wants to avoid
paying for trash service. You can indeed file a police report, but it is
at best questionable whether any action will be taken. It's easy enough
to convince the man to sign up for his own trash service, but it's the
part about getting the police out there to actually confront the service
thief that will be challenging.

Your best bet: **public shaming.**

You say you've already recorded photos and video. Post them on your
neighborhood website, or on your neighborhood forum, or on YouTube. Then
notify the Call for Action desk (or similar consumer protection group)
at your local TV station and tell them where they can check out the
video themselves. If you get some traction with your local TV station,
perhaps the local police will take more interest when a reporter comes
asking about why the police haven't stopped this service thief yet.
