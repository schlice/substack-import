Trump gave a speech in Philadelphia on September 7th, so presumably this
is the most up-to-date position the candidate has. This is what he said:

> TRUMP: Immediately after taking office, I will ask my generals to
> present to me a plan within 30 days to defeat and destroy ISIS.
>
> AUDIENCE: (applause)
>
> TRUMP: This will require military warfare but also cyber warfare,
> financial warfare, and ideological warfare as I laid out on my speech
> on radical Islamic terrorism several weeks ago. Instead of an apology
> tour \-- which you saw President Obama give over and over again \-- I
> will proudly promote our system of government and our way of life as
> the best in the world, just like we did in our campaign against
> communism during the Cold War.

So, being an uneducated deplorable, this sounds to me as if he will
actually get a plan in January, 2017. That doesn't mean he will share it
with all of us, all the time. Because "we" are not going to do any
stopping of anything, questioner. "We" are going to continue doing what
we do, and ***the military*** will take care of ISIS. That's why we pay
them so well.

That also doesn't mean that the Pentagon doesn't have a plan, or that
they don't have any ideas on how they will take on ISIS, right at this
very moment. It means that whatever plans they have are still
classified. Classified things are released on a "need to know" basis
(unless you're Hillary, then you give the terrorists access to
classified email whenever they feel like hacking your personal server).
Since you don't "need to know," you don't know.

Kinda makes sense, doesn't it? Your football team doesn't usually
publish its playbook on the Internet for everyone to read. We tend to
keep that sort of information "close to the vest" so that we can
(somewhat) retain the element of surprise. Maintaining "operational
security" (OPSEC) is an important tenet of warfighting.
