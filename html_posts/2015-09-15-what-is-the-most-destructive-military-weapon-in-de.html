**Content:** [Since the most destructive military weapon ever, the
nuclear warhead, is no longer in development, I would say that the most
destructive military weapon currently in development is the **rail
gun.**\

The railgun is a ***kinetic energy*** weapon, meaning it doesn\'t use
explosives to destroy its target, but the kinetic energy imparted to it
when it is fired to literally disintegrate the target just using the
force of the shot. The raligun uses powerful electromagnets to
accelerate a projectile without the use of explosives or fueled
accelerants to extremely high speeds.\
\
Rail gun rounds can potentially exceed *Mach 10* which means that they
have far more destructive power over greater distances, without the need
to store explosives.
