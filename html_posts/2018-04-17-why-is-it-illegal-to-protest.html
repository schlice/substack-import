**Why is it illegal to protest?**

While the question itself is a little thin, it actually raises a very
valid point.

In the United States, it is not illegal to protest. In fact, your right
to peaceably assemble and seek redress for your grievances from the
government is Constitutionally protected.

HOWEVER

That doesn't mean you get to protest *wherever and whenever* you want.

Every right in the United States tends to follow one simple rule:

**Your right to swing your arm ends at my nose.**

This means that your rights end when they begin to impact my rights.

For example, I have the right to use the roadways which I have funded
with my tax dollars. Does this mean you can't organize a protest and
march down a city street? Not at all! You just have to coordinate with
the City so that they can properly close those roads and re-route
traffic so that other people can enjoy their rights as well.

And think about this:

- There are trucks carrying freight in order to conduct business using
  those roads that you are unlawfully blocking. Do those businesses have
  to lose money for your cause? (Note that there is a separate law
  related to disrupting lawful commerce that you are also violating by
  unlawfully blocking a road)
- There are *ambulances* trying to transport *critical patients* to the
  hospital on those roads that you're unlawfully blocking. Do those
  people have to die for your cause?
- There are police officers trying to get to emergency situations on
  those roads you are blocking. Do the people who have called the police
  have to needlessly suffer for your cause?

No one is denying you the right to protest. However, you are most
definitely denied the ability to block a road without coordinating with
the city so that others can freely exercise their rights as well.

So let's be clear: unlawfully blocking a roadway without a permit

in order to "peaceably protest" is **not legal.** Your right to protest
is not at issue. Unlawfully disrupting traffic and unlawfully blocking
roadways is.
