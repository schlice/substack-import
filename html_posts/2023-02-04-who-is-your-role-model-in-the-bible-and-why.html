Joseph was more loved by his father than any of his other children, so
much so that his father gave him a colored cloak.

His brothers resented him for this. They ultimately decided to not kill
him, but instead decided to sell him off into slavery.

While he was in slavery, he was taken to Egypt and he came to serve
Potiphar, one of Pharaoh's high officials. While serving Potiphar,
Potiphar's wife tried (unsuccessfully) to seduce Joseph. In a fit of
rage, she claimed that Joseph raped her, and Joseph was thrown in
prison.

While in prison, he learned that Pharaoh was deeply troubled by dreams.
Joseph, through his favor with God, was able to learn the meaning of the
dreams, and he reported what he knew to Pharaoh. Pharaoh was so
impressed with Joseph that he released him from prison, and after being
a special advisor to Pharaoh for a time, was made governor of Egypt. He
had to prepare the country for a famine, and he wisely rationed the
country's food in preparation.

While serving in this capacity, Joseph's family came to Egypt to seek
their rations from the government. They did not recognize him, and he
only revealed his identity when he was sure that they had reformed.
Their reunion was triumphant, and Joseph invited them to all re-settle
to Egypt and live with him. This story is found in Genesis 37 and
Genesis 39--45.

All throughout his struggles, Joseph was faithful. He was faithful to
God when he was sold into slavery and when he was imprisoned. While the
story does have a happy ending, there is no indication that, while going
through all of this hardship, he was ever told of God's plan for him.
Joseph was expected, just like you and I are, to live life in something
less than complete understanding of God's plan for us.

**What pleased God was Joseph's faithfulness** ***when nothing made
sense.***

That's the kind of faith I strive to have. Nothing makes sense in my
life, but I pray to have the faith of Joseph, who stayed faithful
despite nothing making sense.
