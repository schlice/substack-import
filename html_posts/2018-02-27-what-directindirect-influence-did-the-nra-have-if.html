**What direct/indirect influence did the NRA have (if any) on SCOTUS'
decision in District of Columbia v. Heller to change the long-standing
interpretation of the 2nd Amendment from collective rights
interpretation to individual rights interpretation?**

First of all, I'll ignore your begging of the question, framing the
issue as a "long-standing collective rights" interpretation --- it was
nothing of the sort. If that were the case, every one of the over 330
million firearms sales to anyone except for a military member would have
been in violation of the Constitution, but that's a separate question,
and I won't address it here.

The NRA was one of [[47
organizations](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0724ac&url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2008/02/amicus-briefs-for-heller-available-in-guns-case/){.external_link

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="scotusblog.com"}]{.qlink_container} who filed *amicus
curiae* briefs ("friend of the court" briefs) on behalf of Heller. An
amicus curiae brief (or an "amicus brief" for short) is a legal document
filed with the court by a non-litigant in the case, but who has a strong
opinion about the subject. Briefs advise the court about relevant
information from a person, group, or industry which may not be
represented by the litigants. Briefs may also advise the court about
relevant arguments that the court may not have considered.

A well-written brief can have a significant impact on judicial
proceedings. Some cases are actually decided by an argument solely
introduced in an amicus. Findings may be narrowed or broadened based on
legal arguments in a persuasive amicus.

The court has the authority to approve or deny parties to file briefs as
amici curiae.

How much persuasion any one brief had in this particular case is only
known to SCOTUS.

Here's some notable quotes from the NRA's brief:

> "In adopting the Second Amendment, the Framers guaranteed an
> individual right to keep and bear arms for private purposes, not a
> collective right to keep and bear arms only in connection with state
> militia service."
>
> "By its terms, the Amendment protects the right 'of the people' to
> keep and bear arms. The holder of the right is unambiguous: it is not
> the States, it is 'the people' themselves."
>
> "Americans' personal right to possess . . . firearms for hunting or
> self-defense was part of the essence of the Framers' view of
> themselves as a free and democratic people. Had Americans in 1787 been
> told that the federal government could ban the frontiersman in his log
> cabin, or the city merchant living above his store, from keeping
> firearms to provide for and protect himself and his family, it is hard
> to imagine that the Constitution would have been ratified."
