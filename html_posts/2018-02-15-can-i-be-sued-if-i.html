In the United States, you can be sued for anything. You don't have to be
sued in this case. If you repay the owners for the cost of the animal
(which could be quite high), you may not be sued.

However, if they are dissatisfied with your attempt to reconcile, they
may still sue you. You could be sued for negligence (although it would
be tough to do) and you'll also be sued for destruction of property.

You'll be ordered to repay the cost of the property (the dog) as well as
an amount for pain and suffering, as pets are universally regarded to be
more than just property emotionally, even though legally they are seen
as property.

In order to prove negligence, the plaintiff will need to show that you
had a reasonable responsibility to protect the animal and you failed to
do so. Your response will be that it was an unforeseeable accident, and
nothing you could have done would have prevented the situation from
occurring; a true accident.

If you're doing this as a bona fide business and not just as a hobby,
you should have insurance, whether or not you accept money for your
work. The IRS makes the distinction between a bona fide business and a
hobby, even when you accept money.
