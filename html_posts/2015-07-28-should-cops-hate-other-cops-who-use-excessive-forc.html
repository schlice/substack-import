**Content:** [First off, I don\'t hate anyone. I strongly dislike some
people, but hate is reserved for things like the Holocaust and Pearl
Harbor.\
\
Second, don\'t ever assume anything. When you ASSUME, you make an ASS
out of U and ME.\
\
*It is easy to assume that if one cop is power hungry, the others
aren\'t far off in a department (common sense, when one part of an
organization becomes corrupt, it\'s usually not long until the rest
does)*\
What I have found is that departments are very \"top-down\" driven
organizations, as most large organizations are. The attitudes and
fundamentals demonstrated in the boss\' office are going to be the
attitudes reflected by the rest of the folks in the organization. Police
departments are no different. The attitude that the sheriff portrays is
the attitude his deputies are going to portray. If he shows an attitude
of inclusion and tolerance, his deputies will portray that attitude.
Conversely, if he maintains an attitude of hostility and fear, his
deputies will portray that to the community as well.\
\
The same, however, does not work in a \"bottom-up\" direction. If you
have one bad cop, for example, he won\'t make the rest bad. And it\'s
not fair to assume that if you see one bad cop, the entire organization
is infected with a lecherous attitude. If you get inside that
organization, you really get to see how those cops react when they are
not being watched by other cops or by the brass. It\'s nearly impossible
to get the feel of organizational climate from interactions with only
one person in that organization.\
\
All of that said, I do believe that cops who consistently use excessive
force need retraining and disciplinary actions taken. I believe cops
should be concerned when an officer consistently violates policy and
consistently uses force that is deemed to be in excess of what was
needed. This is why departments review ***every*** use of force
incident, and ensure the force was justified and not
excessive.]{.rendered_qtext}
