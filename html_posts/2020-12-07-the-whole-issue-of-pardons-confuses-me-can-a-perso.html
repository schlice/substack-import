**The whole issue of pardons confuses me. Can a person be pardoned of a
crime if not convicted? Can a person be pardoned if not charged? Can a
person be pardoned of a yet to be named crime and isn\'t that just
immunity? HELP!**

A pardon can extend to any issues found in the future **related to a
particular incident or a particular timeframe**, but a pardon does not
cover **any crime at all, even if not yet committed**.

In short, ***you can't be pardoned for a crime you haven't committed
yet, but you can be pardoned for any crime you may have committed
already, even if we haven't discovered it yet.***

So for example, President Ford pardoned President Nixon after Ford took
office. He issued a "full, free and absolute" pardon for any crimes
Nixon may have committed while in office, seeking to put a final end to
the "long national nightmare" that was Watergate. Notice that this
pardon would have covered any crime Nixon may have committed during his
time as President, even if we hadn't yet discovered it.

Also note that pardons are for *federal crimes only.* States can still
charge persons who were pardoned if they choose.
