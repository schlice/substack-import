**How quickly can police be at the location of a 911 call?**

This is highly dependent on where you are, and how far away they are. In
some cases, police can be to you within seconds, if you're within
seconds of them. In others, if you're more rural, it can take them
upwards of 30 minutes to get to you.

And that's only if they start rolling as soon as you call. If they
triage your call, it could take them a half hour before they even start
coming to see you, because you're queued up behind other calls for
service.
