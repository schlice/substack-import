Get help. Not for him, but for you.

Clearly, he needs help. But if he doesn't recognize that he needs help,
and if he doesn't willingly go to get help, no amount of you pressuring
him will get him there.

So go get help for yourself. Learn some new ways to interact with him.
Learn some new methods to respond to him. Learn how to set your own
boundaries with him. Counseling can be an invaluable way to learn some
healthier ways to interact with him.

And hopefully when he sees just how successful your sessions are at
restoring you to some sense of sanity, he'll be convinced that he wants
that peace as well.

Original question:

My husband uses his suicidality as an excuse to act insufferable towards
me and when I react he says that him being suicidal makes me treat him
like shit. I don\'t treat him poorly because he\'s suicidal, what do I
do?
