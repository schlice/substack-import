I use one of these exact lockboxes all the time. Simple solution:
Velcro. A ring of Velcro (the soft part) on the keyring and a strip of
velcro (the hook part) on the inside of the box works great for the one
set of keys that has a ring.

For the other (it only holds one single key), we simply stand the key up
upside-down inside the box. It doesn't take much practice to put the
head of the key down in the bottom corner (and as far out towards the
opening as you can get it) and drop the skinny part of the key up
towards the opposite corner of the box. Another simple solution which
actually works.
