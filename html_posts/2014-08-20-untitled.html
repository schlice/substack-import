**Content:** [Once you intimate that someone\'s views have less standing
than your own (calling them mental instability is a good start) you
place yourself as the arbiter of others\' beliefs. You have as much
authority to perform that role as I do.\

Ultimately, it is up to voters to decide if their representative is
adequately representing his or her constituency. If the voters are
looking for a Fundamentalist to radically change the laws in the
country, and they elect someone to do just that, then they are
satisfied. You do have to have enough of them in Congress in order to
actually make a difference though. One voice is not enough to transform
Congress and our entire system of laws.]{.rendered_qtext}
