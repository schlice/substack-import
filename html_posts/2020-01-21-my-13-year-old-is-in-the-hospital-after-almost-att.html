**My 13 year old is in the hospital after almost attempting suicide. He
didn't want me to tell his siblings (10,7) why he's in the hospital.
Should I tell them why?**

Perhaps you can use this opportunity to make a deal with him. You'll
promise to not tell his younger siblings why he's in the hospital if he
agrees to go to therapy with you.

You can simply tell the younger ones that he got hurt but he's going to
be okay. He's going to have to go visit the doctor for a while
afterwards, but it will all be fine. That's not technically a lie, but
it's also not the whole truth either. At this stage in their young
lives, their brains are not yet developed enough to understand the
nuances of what is happening, so I would consider it parental
prerogative to keep the details away from them. Save the whole truth for
later, but you will have to tell them at some point. Just not yet.

You probably should realize that kids, especially at this age, don't
just decide one day to commit suicide. You're going to need to prepare
yourself for a look in the mirror that I can guarantee you will at the
very least be uncomfortable, and at worst, will be quite disturbing. But
if you love your child (which I'm certain you do), you'll do the hard
work needed to remedy the **underlying causes** that are driving your
son to this line of action. There are underlying causes, and someone
other than him is part of the problem.

I know that's a lot to take in, especially while you have a child
recovering from an apparent suicide attempt. But think about it: he'd
rather end his life than reveal what is really going on. He must be so
scared inside. This revelation should steel you to resolve that issue,
sooner rather than later.

Love him, *forgive him,* and **get him help.**

I wish you all the best.
