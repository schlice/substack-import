Short answer: Yes, but as with everything, there are caveats.

In Virginia, a handgun must be \"properly secured in a container or
compartment within the vehicle\" (ie glove box, center console, trunk,
etc). The container or compartment does not have to be locked, the
firearm may be within the reach of the driver or a passenger, and the
firearm may be loaded.

For long guns, a \"county or city may by ordinance make it unlawful for
any person to transport, possess or carry a loaded shotgun or loaded
rifle in any vehicle on any public street, road, or highway within such
locality.\" This does not apply "to any person who reasonably believes
that a loaded rifle or shotgun is necessary for his personal safety in
the course of his employment or business.\" Of course, it also does not
apply to law enforcement.

Also in Virginia, a firearm **may** be considered \"open carry\" in a
vehicle if the firearm is openly visible, though the "container or
compartment" law has more legal run-time and is better-established law.
Therefore, I would suggest you put the firearm in a container or
compartment, such as the glove box, or center console.
