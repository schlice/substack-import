I'm going to take issue with your terminology. You said that the
reprogramming of T cells constitutes a **cure**. I believe it does not.

A *cure* would be something that was changed in the body that prevented
cancer cells from forming. This, instead, is a *lifelong treatment*, not
a *cure*. This is essentially a constant fight between the cancer cells
and the T cells that your body will now have to endure, no doubt enabled
by some new drug to keep the T cells behaving in the way we want them
to. You have to take this medicine for the rest of your life. Does that
sound like a "cure" to you? Not to me. To me, that sounds like an
eternal workaround.

A cure would prevent the cancer from appearing in the first place.

So can we **cure** MS by reprogramming T cells? No, we cannot. We may be
able to eliminate MS symptoms and prevent MS attacks by making the
immune system work more efficiently, but have we really addressed the
cause of the immune system's improper attacking of healthy body tissues?
Until we do that, we don't really have a cure, but a lifelong treatment.
