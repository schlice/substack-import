No.

[[Jose

answer is spot on here.

Remember, dash cam footage is ***evidence***, not ***testimony,*** so it
is not covered by the 5th Amendment.

Evidence is a double-edged sword. If the evidence shows someone
committing a crime, your dash cam footage can be used to help convict
that person and clear you. But if the opposite is true, and your dash
cam footage shows *you* committing the crime, if the police learn you
have a dash cam, they can subpoena your video, and you can be charged
with obstruction if you don't supply it, or destruction of evidence if
you delete it before you give it to them.

Even worse, in the above instance (you have a dash cam and you don't
supply the video), the judge can instruct the jury that *you destroyed
the evidence because it was not going to be beneficial to you,* and they
should treat the lack of video in that way. It's a principle called
"[[spoilation of
evidence](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=bdcef0&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoliation_of_evidence){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}" and it's really
unhelpful to you. Don't do this. It's better to try to explain what the
video is showing, rather than to have the judge tell the jury to
interpret the video **that they never got to see** in the light **that
is the most unfavorable to you**.

So if you're going to install a dash cam to protect yourself, be a good
driver, because your video will show your driving as well as theirs.
