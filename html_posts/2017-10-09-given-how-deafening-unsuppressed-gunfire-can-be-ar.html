Hearing protection is only routinely worn at the range. Officers know
that having to deploy their lethal weapon in the line of duty may be
hazardous to their hearing.

Thankfully, only very, very rarely does an officer have to do this.
There's no realistic way to accomplish this unless an officer uses
earplugs with electronic hearing protection and amplification built in.
