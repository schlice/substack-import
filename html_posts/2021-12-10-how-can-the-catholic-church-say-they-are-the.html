You do realize that in order for a believer to truly believe, any
adherent to any religion must believe that their religion is right and
all the others are wrong.

If not, then either the tenets of your religion are meaningless, or your
faith is weak.

One of the benefits of living in the United States is that we all get to
believe what we choose, or nothing at all. There is no "state religion"
which we all must follow.

Original question:

How can the catholic church say they are the \'one true religion\"? To
me,the Jewish religion would be that! After all, Jesus was a Jew...so
where does the catholic church get off claiming that?
