The answer, as with any legal question, is "it depends."

In a very small handful of states, there is what is known as "common law
marriage." In the few states that allow it, common law marriage is a
legally recognized marriage that occurs when a couple agrees to be
married and lives together without having a formal ceremony or obtaining
a marriage license.

Just living together is not enough. You have to live *as if you are
married.* You agree to be married. You tell everyone (friends, family,
acquaintances, etc) that you are married.

There are only eight states which recognize some form of common law
marriage:

- **Colorado**: Common law marriage contracted on or after Sept. 1,
  2006, is valid if, at the time the marriage was entered into, both
  parties are 18 years or older, and the marriage is not prohibited by
  other law ([[Colo. Stat.
  §14-2-109.5](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=311178&url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/colorado/){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
  qt-tooltip="lexisnexis.com"}]{.qlink_container})
- **Iowa**: Common law marriage for purposes of the Support of
  Dependents Chapter (Iowa Code §252A.3) Otherwise it is not explicitly
  prohibited ([[Iowa Code
  §595.1A](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=86069d&url=https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/ico/section/2014/595.1A.pdf){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
  qt-tooltip="iowa.gov"}]{.qlink_container})
- **Kansas**: Common law marriage will be recognized if the parties are
  18 or older and for purposes of the Divorce and Maintenance Article,
  proof of common law marriage is allowed as evidence of marriage of the
  parties ([[Kan. Stat.
  §23-2502](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c5ea06&url=http://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2013_14/statute/023_000_0000_chapter/023_025_0000_article/023_025_0002_section/023_025_0002_k/){.external_link

- **Montana**: Not strictly prohibited, they are not invalidated by the
  Marriage Chapter (Mont. Stat. §40-1-403)
- **New Hampshire**: Common Law Marriage: \"persons cohabiting and
  acknowledging each other as husband and wife, and generally reputed to
  be such, for the period of 3 years, and until the decease of one of
  them, shall thereafter be deemed to have been legally married.\"
  ([[N.H. Stat.

  qt-tooltip="state.nh.us"}]{.qlink_container})
- **South Carolina**: allows for marriages without a valid license
  ([[S.C. Stat.

In order for there to be property rights in a common law marriage, your
state has to BOTH recognize your common law marriage, AND agree that
common law marriages are recognized for the purposes of dissolution of
that marriage and property distribution.

For couples who have just been "living together," you're going to have
to buck up and divide community property as you see fit. There is no
standard for people who are just living together. You probably haven't
combined financial accounts, so you get the stuff you brought into the
common household (as they do), and then for the stuff you acquired while
you were together, you see who actually bought it, and they get it.

I suppose that's one of the downsides of not being married.
