**Is pretending to have a disability against the law?**

No, pretending to have a disability is not against the law. Laws cannot
be made which restrict your right to free speech.

However, ***why*** you are pretending to have a disability may be
illegal. If you are attempting to extract some sort of benefit or even
monetary gain by declaring yourself disabled, this would be classified
as "theft of service" which is most definitely illegal.

However, if you simply tell people you are disabled when you are not,
you are not doing anything illegal.
