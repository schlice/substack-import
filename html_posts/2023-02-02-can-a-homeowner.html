Yes, and usually the process is fairly tightly controlled.

In most HOAs, modifications to dues can only be discussed during a
Budget Meeting. In Florida, budget meetings must be a separate meeting
from a regular Board meeting or the Annual Meeting. During the Budget
meeting, the Board will distribute the annual budget¹ and will discuss
what costs they know will be changing. They'll discuss whether or not
the Board plans on absorbing those changes from operating reserves or
whether the need exists to raise dues.

They're not challenging conversations, and they're completely necessary.
In order to retain the accommodations that homeowners in that
neighborhood want, they have to be maintained, and that ongoing
maintenance must be paid for. Water (one of our biggest costs) changes
rates every year. Insurance costs go up, those increases must be paid
for.

We can always discuss eliminating amenities in order to reduce dues, but
not many people are really interested in removing the amenities they
currently enjoy.

\

¹ In Condo Associations in Florida, the annual budget must be delivered
to residents well before the meeting, something like 30 days. In
Homeowner's Associations in Florida, this requirement does not exist. We
still deliver a budget to homeowners before the meeting, usually around
48 hours before.
