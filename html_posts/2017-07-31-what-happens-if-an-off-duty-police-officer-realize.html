The question should not be what an off duty police officer does when he
realizes he's been speeding. The question is what happens if an off duty
police officer is ***caught*** speeding.

The answer to the first question (and the one posed by the OP) is the
same thing that happens if a civilian realizes he is speeding. He either
stops speeding, or he doesn't. Same as anyone else. Maybe you were
thinking that there was some kind of self-reporting requirement that
officers have. Some departments may require this, but I am under the
impression that most do not.

The answer to the second question is more unique. In our department,
even if you don't get a ticket, you are *required* to notify your chain
of command any time you encounter local law enforcement in any official
capacity. So even if I don't get a ticket, I still must collect a
business card from the complaining officer so that I can compose an
email to my sergeant and lieutenant and copy the complaining officer so
that they are all aware that at X time on Y date, I was stopped at Z
location by CC'd complaining officer to discuss my excessive speed. I
may hear about it from my chain, I may not. But they need to have the
record of the incident so that their files remain complete and they can
answer questions about how often their officers are contacted by other
agencies, and what the results of those interactions are. This would be
in addition to the ticket, if I got one.
