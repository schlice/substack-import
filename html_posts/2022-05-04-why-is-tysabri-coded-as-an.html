Tysabri can cause a hypersensitivity to antineoplastic (chemotherapy)
drugs. Doctors will have to perform a "desensitization" procedure in
order to "desensitize" the body after Tysabri treatment in order to
safely administer chemotherapy.[\[1\]](#jzFPw){#cite-jzFPw

Original question:

Why is tysabri coded as an "Encounter for antineoplastic chemotherapy."
Is it coded that because tysabri doesn't have code? Or is there another
reason?
