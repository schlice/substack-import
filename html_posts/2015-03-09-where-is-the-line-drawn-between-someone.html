**Content:** [You are not allowed to lie about someone in a way that
causes harm to the person that you lied about. That is the definition of
slander. If you lie about someone and they lose their job because of it,
that is actionable slander.\
\
If the statements you say are actually true and you can prove it, you
have every right to say them. But if they are lies (called oral
defamation) that causes harm to the person being defamed, it is
considered slander, and you can face civil punishments.\
\
Some slanderous statements are actionable *per se*, because the harm is
obvious, like saying that someone has a bad disease, or that someone
can\'t perform their job, or that someone committed a crime.\
