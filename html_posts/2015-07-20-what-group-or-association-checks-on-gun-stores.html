**Content:** [If you\'re asking about *government organizations*, the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms has regulatory control over gun
stores.\
\
If you\'re asking about *private organizations,* I\'d suggest taking a
look at [[the Law Center to Prevent Gun
Violence](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0dc8a0&url=http://smartgunlaws.org/){.external_link
