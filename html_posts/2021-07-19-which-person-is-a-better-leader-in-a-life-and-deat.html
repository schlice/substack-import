False equivalence.

The assumption underlying your question (which isn't really a question,
but instead is a statement that atheists possess logic while theists do
not) is that all theists are dispossessed of any ability to think
logically or critically and act on that assumption. You presuppose that
a theist, in a life-and-death situation, would sit idly by and wait for
God to intervene.

Of course, this is illogical. God gave us **brains**. He gave us
*reason* and *logic*. He expects us to use those. So in a life-and-death
situation, he would expect that we would be able to use our brains and
figure out the best method to get out, just like the atheist.

The truth is that the one who is better in a life-or-death situation is
the one who has had leadership training and has been trained to stay
cool under pressure. Their religion has no bearing on the situation at
that particular moment.

The ***difference*** between the two would come after the situation was
over. The atheist would shout, "Thank you, Mother Nature, for allowing
this brain to spontaneously, accidentally evolve over thousands of years
such that I could figure out this life-or-death situation all by my very
lonesome! Ha, who am I kidding? Why am I thanking Mother Nature? That's
just a child's myth. I just fell together out of spare parts and
electricity, so there's no one to thank. If I have to thank something,
it will be this purposeless, amoral, and meaningless universe which my
logical brain is telling me gave me logic and reason and morals, because
chaos creates order, randomness creates fine-tuning, and non-life
creates life, and that's perfectly logical! Oh well, off to another
personally meaningful but ultimately pointless endeavor. I'll learn and
grow from this experience, and I'll teach others about it, but what's
the point? We all die anyway, and then there's nothingness for all of
eternity."

In contrast, the theist would say, "Thank you God for setting the laws
of nature in motion such that this brain that allowed me to think my way
out of the situation was able to develop. Thank you for giving me this
life that you clearly are saying isn't over yet. You still have more
work for me to do, and I'll do my best. I'll learn and grow from this
experience and I'll teach others about it, and about you, and especially
that this life is not the end, and we have more to look forward to for
all of eternity."

Original question:

Which person is a better leader in a life and death scenario? An atheist
who can figure out the best method to get out or a strongly religious
person who will pray for God\'s interventtion?

*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.
Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a
civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not
misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously, and I have no tolerance
for harassing or inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough
shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion
masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your
own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site.
If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\"
don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything
vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be followed by a
block/mute, and a BNBR report. I will do this immediately and with no
compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*

*With this answer in specific, any ad hominem attacks will be blocked
and reported instantly, so don't bother. Feel free to dissect my logic
if you must, but if I see any attacks for believing in a nonsensical
mythical sky daddy, it's into the bit bucket with your comment.*
