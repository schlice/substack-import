You don't. It makes no sense to tell an atheist how God created the
world. They don't believe in God, so why would you do such a thing?

Instead, you should explain with logic **why a creator god is the only
logical choice for how the universe came to be at all.**

In order to address this truth, you have to begin by asking the correct
question. And that question is: *why am I here? Why is there something,
rather than nothing at all?* The search for the truth about why
something exists rather than nothing at all leads us to understand the
truth about God. The argument for God can be expressed very simply:

1.  Something exists.
2.  You can't get Something from nothing.
3.  Therefore, a necessary and eternal entity created Something.

Even atheists do not deny this logic. They simply claim that the
universe is that eternal entity. However, to date, all scientific and
philosophical inquiry has proven and re-proven that the universe had a
beginning, and the body of evidence proving this fact is continually
growing. If something had a beginning, it is not eternal. Therefore,
being that the only two sources of eternality are an eternal universe or
an eternal Creator, and we have proven that the universe is not eternal,
an eternal Creator must exist. Therefore, the only logical conclusion is
that God exists.

Explaining the creation account to an atheist is like spitting into the
wind. You're really not going to get far. First, you have to get the
atheist to believe that a creator god exists, and then you can explain
how that creator god created the universe and everything in it.
