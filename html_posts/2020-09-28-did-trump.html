No. There is no need to shelve your faith. Accepting the appointment
does not require putting aside faith. It requires faith to accept the
appointment in the first place.

Trump\'s sins are between him and God, just as mine are, and just as
Judge Coney Barret\'s are.

We are warned in the Bible that judgement is the exclusive remedy of
God. Not us.

Treating someone differently because of their sins is exactly the
opposite of Christian love. I wouldn\'t treat Trump any differently than
any other flawed human. We are all sinners. We are all undeserving of
the gift we have been given.

Shelving your faith says "I know that God had a hand in this
appointment, but I know better than God, and Trump is ***LITERALLY MORE
EVIL THAN HITLER*** so I will turn down this appointment because of it."

Do you see how crazy that sounds?
