No, it is not a sin. But we are not instructed to do *only* things that
have something to do with God. **We are instructed to do all things for
the glory of God.**

In everything we do, do it for the glory of God.

There is an amazing writeup by Jon Bloom over at

reproduce that here. It's totally readable, so take the time to read it.

So if by you playing games or chopping trees you give the impression
that you honor other gods besides Him, you shouldn't do those things.
Like Jon says, "\[D\]o not use your freedom to merely pursue what you
feel free to enjoy, but use your freedom to pursue the ultimate
spiritual good of your neighbor." So while you may be free to do it, you
must make sure that you don't unintentionally hurt others' faith walks
in so doing.

Do all you do to the glory of God.
