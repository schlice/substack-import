*My tastes have changed*.

It's more than just "I used to like something, but now I don't." It's a
shift in personality. You could certainly write it off as "just getting
older," but I have seen the change in myself, and it's not all due to
just getting older and changing tastes.

And it's all kinds of things. Food, activities, people, things I used to
enjoy but now don't, etc. It's subtle enough that others don't see it,
but I do.

Original question:

What were some of the more subtle changes you've noticed since your MS
diagnosis?
