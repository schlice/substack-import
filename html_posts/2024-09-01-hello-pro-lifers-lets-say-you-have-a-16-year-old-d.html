You asked what I believe, and I'm not sure that's really what you wanted
to hear, but here goes.

The answer to your question: **no**, I don't believe that a government
should decide if she is allowed to get an abortion. She should not be
allowed to get an abortion, period, and it should be beyond the reach of
government to authorize such a thing.

I don't believe a federal or state government has the right to take a
life without due process of law (it's in the Constitution, it's in the
5th and 14th Amendments). And unless there has been a trial and the baby
has been found guilty of a capital offense and has been given the death
penalty, we should not be **permitted** to take its life.

I teach my children to take responsibility for their actions. They are
well aware of the purpose of sex, and that is to create babies. Yes it's
fun, but it is fun *because* it encourages humans to do it more, in
order to...wait for it...make babies. Physiologically, it is fun so that
humans do it to make more humans. So yes, my 16-year-old daughter would
be homeschooled for a year (in the middle of high school) and would have
that baby and then likely give it up for adoption.

Look, I understand that abortion is a very volatile issue. And I
understand that women have bodily autonomy, and that this autonomy is
very important. But what we have with abortion, in my view, is a
***conflict of rights*** issue, and it is a conflict between the right
of the woman to bodily autonomy and the right of the baby to live.

Scientifically, the baby is a living human. We know it is human because
it has two human parents and it produces human proteins (not frog or
carrot proteins). We know it is alive because it is growing and
consuming energy. **I believe that all living humans have the right to
live, and to not have their life unjustly taken from them.**

I can't think of a way to *consistently* define equal human rights that
excludes fetuses but also includes every kind of born person. I *also*
can't think of a *consistent* reason to allow someone's right to bodily
autonomy to trump someone else's right to live. And again, I do think
that women have bodily autonomy, and while I agree that the right to
bodily autonomy is important, I don't think that the right to bodily
autonomy gives anyone the right to kill another human. Take the case of
conjoined twins, where separating them means that only one will live.
Does the right to bodily autonomy of the one twin give them the right to
kill the other twin? Which twin's right to bodily autonomy trumps the
other twin's right to life?

Society has lots of conflicts of rights, and I do think that the woman's
right to bodily autonomy is valuable and important. But in this
particular case of this particular conflict of rights, I think the
baby's right to life outweighs the mother's right to bodily autonomy.
