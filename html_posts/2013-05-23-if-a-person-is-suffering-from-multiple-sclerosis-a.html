**Content:** [As always, the true answer is \"it depends.\" The patient
and his/her doctor will need to evaluate the specific circumstances in
order to determine the best course of treatment. It depends on the age
and general overall and neurological health of the patient, the degree
of advancement of the MS, as well as the type of MS the patient has. If
the person is older and the MS is not exceedingly advanced, assuming the
patient has RRMS, the patient and his/her doctor may choose to do
nothing and simply allow the disease to progress, and deal with the
relapses as they occur. Medication is certainly an option; however, in
most cases, there isn\'t a surgery that is helpful.]{.rendered_qtext}
