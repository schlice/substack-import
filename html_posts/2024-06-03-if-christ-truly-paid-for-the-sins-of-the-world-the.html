I'm going to answer these out of order. It will make sense later. Trust
me.

> **That is, the fact that they sin is the result of a curse placed on
> humanity because of SOMEONE ELSE'S SIN.**

Adam's sin *changed humanity*. It changed us by *separating us from
God.* Jesus reunited us with God. That's the 30,000 foot view. Let's
talk details though.

Before the first sin, Adam and Eve walked with God in the Garden. They
could talk to God directly. They were as close to God as you could get.

After the fall, humanity was separated from God. Because Adam's choices
had introduced sin into the human condition, our bodies became
susceptible to disease and early death because of it.

We were always free to choose good or evil. But now we get to choose
good or evil in sinful bodies which cannot help but to sin. And because
of our sin condition, most of us sin without even thinking about it, in
our thoughts and in our words, in what we have done, and what we have
failed to do. We are all sinners. Each and every one of us have fallen
short of God's glory. If God were nothing but completely just, He would
be well within His rights to reject us all from His Kingdom and send us
to the torment of eternal separation from Him.

But He has offered us an alternative.

Instead of leaving us to this fate, He sent His son to pay for our sin
in our place. Jesus died on the cross, accepting onto Himself the sins
of the world: past, present, and future. His sacrifice paid for all of
our sin. His blood washed us clean. All we have to do is repent of our
sin and accept Jesus as our savior.

He built the system this way so we have the freedom to choose to love
Him or reject Him without violating our free will. If you think about
it, it's actually a pretty ingenious system.

The TLDR here is that you can *blame* God for the way this is, or you
can *love* Him for who He is and what He has done. In other words, you
can be ***bitter***, or you can be ***better.***

Be better.

Is anyone truly innocent? As we have seen, we are all sinners. No one is
truly innocent.ยน

Also, God has written His truth on to everyone's hearts, and His
invisible hand can be seen in all of His creation, in nature. In this
way, everyone knows about God. But people reject what they know is true.
This is what sends people to hell, not God. In other words, *people
willingly separate themselves from God by rejecting what they know in
their hearts to be true.*

It is only the people who have accepted Christ as their savior who
benefit from His salvific work on the cross.

ยน Children and the mentally handicapped are unable to consciously reject
God, and so they are not held responsible for that inability to reject
Him.
