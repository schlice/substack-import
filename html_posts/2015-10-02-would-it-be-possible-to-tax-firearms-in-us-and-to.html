**Content:** [Why does the responsible, legal gun owner have to foot
that particular bill? If this is a problem with education, or mental
illness, or social services, why add *more tax* (there\'s already sales
tax on firearms) for those services? Why not tax everyone and increase
funding to those services?\
\
So your **real** question should be \"Why doesn\'t the US just spend
more on education, rehabilitation, social services, etc.\" Ask *that*
question and you might find some answers as to why those services are in
the state they are.]{.rendered_qtext}
