HOAs are relatively unconcerned about house flippers. Flippers buy
houses as cheaply as they can, come in and fix up the house, and resell
it at a profit. This is a big win for the HOA, because it helps the
median home prices in the neighborhood, and fixes up any possibly
less-than-optimal properties. Flippers are good business for HOAs.

We are more concerned about selling houses to rental companies, or even
worse, companies who buy houses to use as AirBnB rental houses.

Short term rental customers are, in general, unconcerned about the
neighborhoods in which their rental houses exist. Having many different
tenants in a single-family housing community increases traffic in the
neighborhood, and increases the likelihood of problems and disturbances
which could occur at the property. This tends to decrease median home
values in the neighborhood, because no one wants to live next to a
vacation rental property.

HOAs solve this problem simply by requiring any lease of your house to
be a minimum of a 6-month lease. Our Governing Documents specifically
exclude short-term or vacation rentals in our neighborhood, and require
all leases to be a minimum of 6 months.
