First of all, this was a test firing, there was no nuclear warhead on
board.

Secondly, the people in NORAD who monitor missile launches **knew well
in advance** that this launch was happening. Our intelligence assets in
the Mountain are top-notch. We were already in contact with Britain's
PWHQ and we knew that a test launch was happening. We knew when it was
going to happen, and we were fully prepared for the alarms to go off. So
when they did, and we saw a missile launch off the coast of Florida, we
went "meh."

I will tell you that the "pucker factor" climbs exponentially when the
missile does something which you do not expect. So if the systems were
able to correlate the trajectory data fast enough, the systems in NORAD
would have displayed that Florida was threatened by this test launch.
The Missile Warning Center would have been on the phone with PWHQ and
saying, "why is your missile going off-course" and "do you see what I
see?"

So:

- No nuke was involved.
- We knew about the launch.
- We were fully aware of the entire situation.
- The missile was properly detonated by RSOs when it went off-course.

**TL;DR: Move along, nothing to see here.**
