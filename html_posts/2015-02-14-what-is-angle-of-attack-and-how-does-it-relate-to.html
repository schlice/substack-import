**Content:** [In fluid dynamics, the angle of attack (AOA) is the angle
between the direction of the oncoming air and the chord of an airfoil.
Usually the chord is a line between the leading and trailing edge of the
aircraft.\
\
Many modern aircraft do not have an AOA indicator, and in at least one
aircraft accident that I know of, failure to fully understand the
aircraft\'s AOA was a factor in a crash.]{.rendered_qtext}
