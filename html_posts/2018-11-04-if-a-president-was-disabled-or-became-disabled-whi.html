There are a few possibilities.

A jetway

:::: ui_qtext_image_outer
::: qtext_image_wrapper
![](images/qimg-7160d37b26c3b6662e48f569094627e0){.landscape
.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed
master_src="images/qimg-7160d37b26c3b6662e48f569094627e0" master_w="600"
master_h="332"}

Or a lift vehicle, like the ones that service the aircraft.

Another option might be a new ramp tech for people with limited
mobility, which is being designed by IndiGo:

:::: ui_qtext_image_outer
::: qtext_image_wrapper
![](images/qimg-b9915cfa89f9b6f7e48ab693b63ab37c){.landscape
.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed
master_src="images/qimg-b9915cfa89f9b6f7e48ab693b63ab37c" master_w="512"
master_h="384"}

All of these are ways to get up to the aircraft door with limited
mobility
