You said "I say X, and all they hear is Y." It sounds like there is
either a problem with the translation, or if it happens to be in the
same language, the interpretation. X is always X. If the other person
interprets it as Y, either you're not being clear enough, or they have a
particular "filter" in place that converts X into Y.

I'll leave it at that. I won't blame any particular party for placing
filters, because they both do it.
