**Why is it so hard to hold the police accountable for their actions?**

How have the police not been held to account?

Police officers face far more investigation in a shooting than any
average citizen. For example, if I shoot someone, the District Attorney
will investigate and determine whether or not I committed a crime. If he
determines I did not, case closed. If a police officer shoots someone in
the line of duty, he faces the same DA investigation, but he also faces
an internal Use Of Force (UOF) review by his chain of command, looking
to ensure that his use of force was conducted in accordance with
department policy and if not, whether or not he needs more training, or
if he needs disciplinary action taken, up to and including termination.
Note that this review is independent of the DA's determination of
whether or not a crime was committed. Additionally (and wholly separate
from the other two), the US Department of Justice can investigate the
officer to see if the civil rights of the victim were violated. In other
words, a police officer faces no less than three times the amount of
investigation than a citizen would in the same situation.

Are you certain that the "accountability" you're looking for is not
"retribution?" Are you sure you're not just looking for "someone to pay"
for what happened? Or are you simply concerned that police officers are
offered more leniency because of what they do for a living, for you, day
in an day out, to keep you safe? Oftentimes, people erroneously equate
"going to jail" with "accountability," and if no one lost their jobs or
went to jail, then they believe that no one has been held accountable.
That doesn't sound like accountability. That sounds like vengeance.

Be careful that you don't confuse "justice" with "vengeance."
