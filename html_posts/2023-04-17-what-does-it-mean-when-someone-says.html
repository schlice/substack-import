It's actually untrue. **Atheists need** ***much more faith*** **than
everyone else.**

What is faith? Faith is the distance we must travel between what we know
and what we believe. Faith begins where knowledge ends.

For example, can anyone be **certain** that gravity works on all dropped
objects? No, because no one has personally observed all dropped objects.
Gravity probably works on all dropped objects, and we probably have a
high degree of certainty that it does, **but are we 100% certain?** The
answer is no, but the amount of faith we need to believe that gravity
works on all dropped objects is pretty small, because all of our
observational evidence supports the belief that it does. Similarly, do
we know that all humans are mortal? No, it is possible that someone in
the past did not die, or that someone in the future will not die. We're
pretty sure, to a high degree of certainty, but we can never be 100%
sure. We can approach 100%, but we can never be 100% certain.

Answers like these are based on ***induction***. And any answer based on
induction can never be 100% proven, only highly likely.

Christians believe that God exists. All of our observational evidence
tells us that He does. So it doesn't take too much faith for us to
believe that God exists. We believe that God exists beyond a reasonable
doubt, because all of the evidence we have points more towards a creator
rather than away from a creator. However, atheists believe that God does
not exist. They have zero evidence to support this belief. Therefore,
they need much more faith to believe that God does not exist than
theists need to believe that God does.
