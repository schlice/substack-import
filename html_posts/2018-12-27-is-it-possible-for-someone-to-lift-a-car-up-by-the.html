**Is it possible for someone to lift a car up by themselves in an
emergency?**

It is thought that what is commonly known as [[hysterical
strength](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e34f48&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysterical_strength){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} is at least
*theoretically* possible.

It is incredibly difficult to document. Nearly all of the evidence is
anecdotal. But it appears, at least in theory, that the ability of the
body to use adrenaline to exceed what we theoretically know as the
body's limitations is possible.

It has been documented, anecdotally, to have
occurred.[\[1\]](#CxQlZ){#cite-CxQlZ
