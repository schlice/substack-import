First of all, *Roe* is dead and is not coming back. ***At best***, we
pass a national law mandating a minimum amount of time a state must
permit elective abortions, but we're years away from that happening.

As for the sex strike, here's an analogy.

The police don't care that you use Waze to mark their locations. They
also don't care that you use CB radios or your Escort radar detectors to
notify you that a police officer is clocking traffic. That's because,
despite the naysayers who believe that the police are just out to make
money, the police perform traffic patrol to keep speeds down. Similarly,
notifying you that there is a police officer on the side of the road
naturally slows traffic. So by doing so, we actually accomplish the
original goal of traffic safety.

Similarly, like the last time that abortion promoters said that they
were going on a sex strike, perhaps they don't realize that not everyone
will participate. Only the people who planned on having irresponsible
sex, and even if they do use protection, not taking responsibility if
they are the 1% who gets pregnant even though they did so. And by
responsibility, I only mean hosting that baby for 9 months and then
giving it up for adoption. No one is telling you that you must become a
mother. Just don't kill babies. Anyway, this accomplishes the goal of
the pro-life movement: reducing unwanted pregnancies which would result
in abortions.

I see no issue here.

As for Ashley Madison and Tinder, the hook-up culture is going to have
to rethink how it works. I can't see the hook-up culture going away any
time soon, but depending on which state you live in, you may have to
make some changes to how you do what you do.
