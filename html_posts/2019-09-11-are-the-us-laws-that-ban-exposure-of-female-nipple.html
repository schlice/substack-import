**Are the U.S. laws that ban exposure of female nipples (but not male) a
violation of the 14th Amendment?**

Technically, yes.

However, courts have relied much more heavily on states' beliefs that
women's bodies are sexual, and that the female breast is more closely
related to *genitalia* than it is to a simple infant feeding structure.

This is, of course, our own fault. United States society has sexualized
the female breast, starting with our more prudish Victorian and
Judeo-Christian heritage, and never really changing. Clearly, the
"sexual revolution" in the 60s was an attempt to change this, but it has
existed for hundreds of years, and that kind of inertia is difficult to
change. You can't turn the cruise ship on a dime.

Are state laws which criminalize female toplessness an actual violation
of the 14th Amendment? It sure looks like it. It also looks like such
laws are some of the worst examples of gender discrimination our society
still clings to.

More specifically, the government must show that if it is going to
infringe unequally on a right, there must be a compelling state interest
in doing so, and such interest really doesn't exist today.

It seems that the time is right for a woman to bring such a
Constitutional challenge. No other time in US history has seen
conditions so ripe for change as now.
