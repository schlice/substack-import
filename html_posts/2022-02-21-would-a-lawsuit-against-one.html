Snowball's chance in The Hot Placeâ„¢ especially if the circumcision took
place in the medically-standard infant timeframe.

1.  Parents have the ability to make medical decisions on behalf of
    their children, including body modifications.
2.  Circumcision as an infant has been shown to significantly reduce
    certain cancers.
3.  Circumcision is universally accepted as not harmful, both physically
    and psychologically. The penis still functions exactly the same as
    it did before, and society does not look askance at a circumcised
    penis vs an uncircumcised penis.

While anything is possible, this type of lawsuit would be extremely
unlikely to prevail, or provide muct in the way of compensatory damages.
