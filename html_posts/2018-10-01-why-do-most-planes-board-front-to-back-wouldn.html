Mythbusters actually tested this, as there are multiple ways to board an
aircraft. They actually found that the back-to-front method is the
**slowest** way to board an aircraft.

You can see that the "Southwest Method" (no assigned seats) is actually
the fastest boarding method, but it earned the lowest satisfaction
score. You can see that the WILMA (Window, Middle, Aisle) method, and
the zoned WILMA method (Rear zone WILMA, Middle zone WILMA, Front zone
WILMA), and the Reverse Pyramid method, while all somewhat slower than
the Southwest Method, earned some of the highest customer satisfaction
scores in the test.
