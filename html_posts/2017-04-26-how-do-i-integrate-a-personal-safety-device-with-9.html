The problem you will run into will be the interface between the user and
the 911 dispatcher. How will your system communicate to 911? Remember
that there are probably close to 6,000 different 911 dispatch centers
(called Public Safety Answering Points, or PSAPs) around the country, as
some states use regional call centers, so there isn't a dispatch center
for every department. Plus, the technology used by each PSAP is
different and evolving:

- Basic 911 is available everywhere, and it is simply an operator at the
  other end of the line.
- Enhanced 911 uses systems on the PSAP side to interpret information
  passed from the telephone service provider and correlate it with
  databases at the PSAP to display the location from where the call
  originated.
- Next Generation 911 is just beginning to roll out, and it will use
  IP-based communications to share voice, video and data between a
  caller and the PSAP

Until we get a single standard in place nationwide, your system will
have to work with the lowest common denominator, or at the very least be
able to adjust to the capabilities at the particular PSAP to which it
connects. It may only encounter a Basic 911 location, or it may
encounter a NG911 center. It should be able to handle both
contingencies.
