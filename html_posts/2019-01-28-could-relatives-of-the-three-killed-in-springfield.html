**Could relatives of the three killed in Springfield, MO, successfully
sue Middlesex, New Jersey and its sheriff for wrongful death for
ignoring the ICE detainer and releasing the man that later became the
alleged killer?**

Wrongful death would mean that the preponderance of evidence showed that
the action (or inaction) of the respondent caused the death of the
subject.

These four elements are generally required for a wrongful death suit:

1.  The death of a human being;
2.  Caused by another\'s negligence, or with intent to cause harm;
3.  The survival of family members who are suffering monetary injury as
    a result of the death, and;
4.  The appointment of a personal representative for the decedent\'s
    estate.

It's that step 2 where this suit would fail. You would have to prove
that the sheriff had an obligation to follow the ICE detainer, and then
negligently failed to follow it.

The county sheriff is not the US Customs and Immigration Services (what
used to be called ICE). The county sheriff is under no obligation to
enforce Federal law, as he is not a Federal agent, in exactly the same
way that a Federal agent cannot enforce county ordinances.

To that end, the county sheriff is under no obligation to honor USCIS
detainers. Therefore, there was no wrongful death caused by the sheriff.
