Functionally, yes. The officer is not performing work responsibilities
in uniform, and is still getting paid.

But that's literally where the similarities end.

The officer is usually told to stay home. Back in the day (BC, Before
Cellphones), they were literally told to stay home to stay near the
phone. Today, most departments don't force the officers to stay home,
but they must stay close to home. Some tell them that they have to stay
within a certain distance of the department so that they can be called
in as required. They may not perform any law-enforcement duties during
this time.

The time away is no picnic. If the officer was involved in a shooting,
they are likely not sleeping at night, while their brain replays the
events over and over, processing the trauma and inventing new scenarios
to try to see if it could have ended differently. To that end, the
officer will have to schedule psychiatric counseling during this time
(and in the vast majority of cases, they need it to help process what
they have been through). The department, in the meantime, is collecting
as much evidence as they have, and will be conducting a Use of Force
Review. That review will determine whether or not the officer used force
appropriately and if they need remedial training, or perhaps if force
was used incorrectly or unlawfully, disciplinary action, up to and
including termination. The District Attorney will be starting their
investigation, and their investigators will probably want to talk to the
officer, so he has to be available for those interviews. Finally, the
Department of Justice may start investigations to see if the victim's
civil rights were denied.

So the officer sits away from work, constantly replaying what he did,
while his employer goes over his every action with a fine-toothed comb
to see if he did anything wrong and to determine whether or not he gets
to keep his job, while at the same time, the DA and the DOJ look to see
if he needs to go to jail for doing his job.

If this is your idea of "paid vacation," we should consider vacationing
separately.
