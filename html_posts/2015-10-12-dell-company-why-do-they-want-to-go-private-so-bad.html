Dell privatized the company a few years ago. Removing themselves from
the public trading market does several things. First, it allows them to
not have to do things like quarterly reporting of revenues, which tends
to scare off investors when markets fluctuate. It also allows your
business to be more agile, as you have fewer layers of approvals to go
through in order to make significant business decisions. A Board of
Directors which is beholden to the shareholders requires much more time
and effort to \"make the elephant dance.\" Privatizing allows you to
focus more on structuring the business the way you want it to be,
without having to be constantly worried about hitting earnings targets.

It\'s no secret that Dell wanted to get out of the flagging PC business.
Tablets by Microsoft and Apple are giving PCs a run for their money.
Dell has long desired to increase their footprint in the enterprise
space. A privatization move allowed them to make the necessary changes
to advance that goal.
