**Content:** [Your battery program is not working.\
\
You show both \"Screen on\" and \"Screen Dark\" for the exact same
amount of time, along with \"Wifi On\" and \"No Signal\" for exactly the
same time.\
\
So this really doesn\'t tell you anything.\
\
Try using the built-in battery monitor, it\'s actually not too bad.\
\
Or, if you don\'t mind a recommendation, try [[DU Battery
