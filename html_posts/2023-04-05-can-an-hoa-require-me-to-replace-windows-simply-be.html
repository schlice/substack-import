You've got a lot of answers here, and *most* of them are right.

Ultimately, whether or not they can do this depends on *why* they are
asking you to change the windows.

- If the reason is, as you say, simply because the windows are **old**,
  then there must be some clause in the Governing Documents which states
  that homes can only have windows newer than X years old and the HOA
  can make you change them.
- The reason may also be because the windows *look old*. Remember that
  it is in, in fact, the HOA's job to maintain the look of the
  neighborhood. And if your windows look *obviously old* and are
  objectively an eyesore (which I doubt, but the HOA could make that
  case), they might be able to make you update them. At least the ones
  in the front of the house, anyway.

Whatever reason they cite must be something that they are allowed to
regulate. If they are not allowed to regulate whatever their reason they
cite because the governing documents do not specifically support that
reason, then they cannot force you to do so using that reason.

But be prepared for a legal fight if they persist. The only way to stop
them from forcing you is with the help of a lawyer.
