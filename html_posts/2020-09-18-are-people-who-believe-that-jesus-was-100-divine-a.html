**Are people who believe that Jesus was 100% divine and 0% human
damned?**

No, they're just misinformed.

But I'd ask them what exactly they believe. Christians believe that
Jesus was born, lived, and died, and was raised back to life on the
third day, conquering death. This death and resurrection paid for our
sin and paved the way for us to enter heaven.

I guess I have a question: *if Jesus was 100% divine, how did he die?*

He had to be born as a man. He wanted to feel what we feel. He wanted to
live as we live. He needed to do this in order to redeem us. He wouldn't
have been able to be a perfect vessel for our sin if he didn't come to
earth and live a perfect life without sin.

In other words, *Jesus had to be born as human in order to fulfill his
destiny.*

If Jesus wasn't human, how was he able to die for our sins?
