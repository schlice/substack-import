**I stole from my employer. The items stolen (phones, EarPods, laptop)
have been seized. Can I buy back the items in court legally?**

You cannot buy the items in court. The courtroom is not a sales floor.
There is no mechanism in court by which you can buy the items. The items
will be returned to the employer at the conclusion of the trial.

If you still somehow managed to be on speaking terms with the company
(who undoubtedly fired you), when your trial and sentence is over
(assuming you went to jail for the theft), you might ask them if you can
buy the items.
