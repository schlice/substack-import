**Does Apple Watch 3 connect to the Internet without a phone? Apple
says: \"Leave your phone at home and still get alerts from your favorite
apps.\"**

Yes, Apple Watch 3 has cellular connectivity as well as Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth.

You must have a cellular "add-on" plan with your wireless carrier, and
it must be the same carrier as your iPhone.

The watch has its own IMEI, and therefore registers on the network as
its own device. It must be registered separately on the plan. Generally,
there is an "add-on" option that costs anywhere from \$5 to \$15 per
month to add a cellular-capable tablet or smart watch to your current
plan, but the structure and cost for this service varies by carrier.
T-Mobile has a tablet and smart watch add-on to any of their plans that
is usually \$10 per month. The device has its own data limits.

Check with your carrier to find out how much adding an Apple Watch to
your plan will cost you.
