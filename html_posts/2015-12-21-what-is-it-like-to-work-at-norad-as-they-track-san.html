TL;DR: It was a lot of fun, and as I understand it, it still is.

The whole \"NORAD tracks Santa\" thing started before I got there. It
actually started in November of 1955, when a Colonel in the COC (Combat
Operations Center) answered his commercial desk phone line to hear a
child\'s voice saying, \"Is this Santa Claus?\" It seems that a Sears ad
listed a phone number that you could call and talk directly to Santa,
but a child mis-dialed, inverting two digits and reaching an unlisted
number in the COC. The Colonel answered \"\...much more roughly than he
should---considering the season: 'There may be a guy named Santa Claus
at the North Pole, but he's not the one I worry about coming from that
direction.'"\[1\]

The newly-formed Air Force decided to use the gaffe as a PR stunt, and a
month later, they published press releases indicating that the Air Force
was in contact with Santa and they would be monitoring his progress the
whole way to keep him safe. Remember that we were in the height of the
Cold War at that time, and kids were rightly afraid for Santa\'s safety.
The press ate it up, and the AP wire picked up the story and
redistributed it with abandon.

The Air Force initially used the momentum to gain some much-needed free
publicity for the mission that they just recently started. However, the
good-hearted military members who call themselves Airmen continued the
Santa-tracking tradition, publishing an actual phone number that kids
could call. When I was working in NORAD in the late 90\'s, it was a
rollover line that was added to our desk phones, and we had a script to
read which changed based on the hour. It was actually quite fun; we
really enjoyed being able to give back to the community with something
as simple as answering a phone and reading a paragraph.

These days, the NORAD Santa hotline is staffed in a dedicated facility
with over 1200 Air Force volunteers answering calls. [[The
