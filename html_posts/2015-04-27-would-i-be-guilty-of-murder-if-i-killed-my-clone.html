**Content:** [The fact that one person is an exact copy of another
person does not mean that the copy does not have as much right to live
as the original. It is still a functioning human being, who has as much
right to life and protection under the law as the original. The fact
that it is a *clone* makes it no less of a *human*. Until we start
cloning humans, we won\'t have to address this in our laws.\
\
Whether or not it is murder is up to the court, but it would be judged
in the same way that any murder case would. The definition of murder (at
least in our jurisdiction) is **the unlawful taking of another human
life with forethought and intent.** So just as in any other murder
trial, these elements will be examined.\
\
Whether or not it is morally wrong to kill your clone is another matter
altogether.\
