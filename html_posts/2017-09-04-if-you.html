You've made an incredible amount of assumptions, including the fact that
the car "senses" that a "fatal" crash is about to occur.

This assumes:

1.  The vehicle is aware that it is about to be in a crash, which means
    that its driving algorithms which are designed to prevent crashes
    (by keeping appropriate speed and distances) has failed, or
2.  The vehicle is about to be struck in an unavoidable way by another
    vehicle and this was not caused by any fault in its programming.

The problem here is that you assume that **the vehicle is aware that it
is about to be involved in an accident**, and **the vehicle can do
something about that knowledge.**

I submit that vehicles will never evolve (in our lifetime) to the point
where they know that they are about to be in an accident. I would also
submit that a vehicle will never be able to determine whether or not a
crash is about to be a "fatal" one.

But even if they do, I think their default mode of operation will be
**emergency braking.** If they are hit at that point, they will simply
protect their occupants as best as possible, which is also how they were
designed.
