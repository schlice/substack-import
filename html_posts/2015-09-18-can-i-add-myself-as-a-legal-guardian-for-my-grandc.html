**Content:** [You stated that you want guardianship to be able \"to sign
official papers and make some decisions.\"\
\
If that\'s the case, a power of attorney should be all you need. You can
then perform whatever parental duties are authorized in the power of
attorney documentation. You could sign as a guardian at the doctor\'s
office, or sign the child into and out of day care or school. The power
of attorney document is a powerful tool, and should provide you with
everything you need.\
\
I think becoming a guardian ad litem is a very big step with very big
consequences that you probably don\'t need to undertake.\
\
By the way, talking to a family practice attorney would have likely
yielded the same information. Many of them here where I live will do a
free initial consultation.\
\
And if you do want to move forward, I highly recommend you work through
your family attorney.]{.rendered_qtext}
