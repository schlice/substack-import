**Content:** [Do you not see the fallacies of your generalizations? You
are looking at such a small data set that it\'s not even worth it.\
\
If I meet 5 cops in my town and they all happen to be racist, is it then
okay for me to generalize and say that all cops are racist? No, because
the sample set is too small. Now, if I meet a cop from every part of the
country, big departments, little towns, and have a good representative
set, and they are all racist, then I might be able to make that claim.
But only meeting 5 from one area only tells me about that
area.]{.rendered_qtext}
