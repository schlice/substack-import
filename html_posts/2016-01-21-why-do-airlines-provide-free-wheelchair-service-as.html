First of all, the **airline** does not provide wheelchair service. The
**airport** does. It\'s an important distinction. The service that runs
wheelchairs around the airport is provided by the airport; the airline
only indirectly funds the service through landing fees.

Secondly, ADA makes all disability services easy to abuse. All I have to
do is ***claim*** I have a disability. I don\'t have to ***prove*** I
have a disability. This isn\'t limited to airport wheelchairs (think
\"assistance animals\" akin to glamour girls with purse pups).

There are several practical reasons why **airports** provide wheelchair
service.

1\. The infamous and troublesome Americans with Disabilities Act. ADA
requirements say that disabled persons need to have the same access to
facilities that non-disabled persons do. Therefore, to get disabled
persons through the airport expediently, wheelchair service is provided.

2\. Wheelchairs owned and operated by the airport can go into and out of
the security checkpoint without a tremendous amount of security
difficulty.

3\. Disabled persons must transfer from a traditional wheelchair (in the
airport) to an aircraft wheelchair (in the plane) because it fits down
the aircraft aisle.
