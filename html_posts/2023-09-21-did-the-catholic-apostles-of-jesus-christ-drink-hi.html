No.

There is also no indication in the Bible that the disciples believed
that the bread and the wine were transformed into Jesus' body and blood.
Consider that right after He broke the bread and passed the cup, He
said:

> I tell you, I will not drink from this fruit of the vine from now on
> until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.
> --- Matthew 26:29 NIV

Jesus called it "the fruit of the vine," not "blood." Was He confused,
or did He really not believe that the wine changed to blood? The Bible
evidence is clear that it is the latter.

There is also no indication that the disciples worshipped the elements.
The Church says, "Moreover, the Catholic Church has held firm to this
belief that Christ's Body and Blood in the Eucharist not only in her
teaching but in her life as well since she has at all times paid this
great Sacrament the worship known as 'latria,' which may be given to God
alone."[\[1\]](#ligme){#cite-ligme .citation_link} Where is the worship
given the Sacrament by the disciples anywhere in the New Testament? It
is not there.

What is clear from the Bible is that the disciples believed, as we do,
that Jesus was speaking in parables, and using literary devices to teach
lessons, as He did so often throughout His earthly ministry. He did not
mean that the bread would become His literal body, or that the wine
would become His literal blood. And He did not mean for people to become
cannibals and eat flesh, or violate Levitical law and drink blood.
