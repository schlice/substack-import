**As of February 25, China made Xi 'President for Life'. Could
two-thirds of Congress extend the same courtesy to Trump?**

No.

The 22nd Amendment to the US Constitution limits the United States
president to two terms.

There is a Constitutionally-mandated procedure for repealing and
replacing an Amendment, and that is to pass a new Amendment.

The only thing that 2/3 of Congress can do is to pass a Bill of
Amendment to repeal the 22nd Amendment and allow Congress to appoint a
president for life.

However, this amendment must then be ***ratified*** by 3/4th of the
states before it becomes law, so you still need 38 separate states to
ratify the amendment.

So if 2/3 of Congress ***AND*** 3/4 of the states all want Trump to be
president for life, they can indeed pass the appropriate Constitutional
amendment to make it so. But 2/3 of Congress alone won't make it happen.
