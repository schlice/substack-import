As always, the answer is found in the Governing Documents of the HOA in
question.

In most cases though, Governing Documents do not require HOAs to take a
property owner to court before applying a lien to their property. They
simply require a certain number of months of non-payment, or a certain
minimum dollar amount of unpaid fees (sometimes both), and they can turn
the account over to the attorney who will process the lien.
