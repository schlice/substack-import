**How are HOAs legal? If it's my property, what gives nosy neighbors the
right to tell me what I can do with my property?**

Besides all of the great and correct answers here (the HOA is a contract
you signed when you bought your house, and you absolutely have the right
to live in a neighborhood that is not controlled by an HOA), we should
review the purpose of an HOA.

HOAs exist to keep your home value as high as possible. They do this
*not* by telling you what you can do with your home, but by telling
*your neighbors* what they can do with *their* home. When you list your
house for sale, prospective buyers evaluate the neighborhood and
determine whether or not they want to buy **your house** (which is your
responsibility) in **this neighborhood** (which is your neighbors'
responsibility).

You can control what happens to your house; you own it. But you alone
can't make your neighbors keep their lawns cut. You can't make them keep
junk cars out of their driveways. You can't prevent them from painting
their house hot pink if they choose. You may be able to spend years in
court and spend thousands of dollars to try to litigate them into
compliance, but that is a massive hassle, makes for terrible neighbor
relations, and most importantly, creates a neighborhood where no one
wants to live.

The HOA exists in such a way that all homeowners are bound by the same
rules, and so that all homeowners must live by those rules or face
fines, and possible liens against their homes for failure to pay those
fines. This way, if your neighbor is not keeping up his end of the
bargain, the HOA has the power to fine them.

Of course, this implies that *you are a neighbor to someone else*, but
it's not about controlling you for the sake of controlling you. It's
about regulating what you do with the visible exterior areas of your
house for the benefit of the entire neighborhood.

Just remember *High School Musical*: We're all in this together.
