It saddens me that such a question exists.

Love is lots of things. Judgmental is not one of them.

> Love is patient, love is kind, love has no envy, love is not proud,
> love behaves, love is not selfish or easily provoked, love is not
> evil, love shares truth instead of spreading lies, love bears all,
> love believes all, love endures all, love is hope for all, love never
> fails.[\[1\]](#pmTxR){#cite-pmTxR .citation_link}

That passage is loosely translated from a particular religious book
which shall remain nameless, even though most people know what it is
(this particular interpretation of that passage is lyrics in a song).

When you find someone who loves you for *who you are* rather than for
*what you look like*, you know you found true love.

But you have to love yourself first, before you can handle what others
think of you. If you believe you have saggy breasts and loose skin,
others' reinforcement of that will not be beneficial to you. Love
yourself first, *then* you will be able to handle others' misguided
opinions about you.
