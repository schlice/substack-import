<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [As a matter of clarification, I\'d like to add that guns<br>are a popular target for the left because guns are the only tools that<br>are purpose-built for killing. Knives, shovels, cars, baseball bats,<br>etc., while useful for killing, are purpose-built for other things. They<br>can kill with varying levels of effectiveness, but they are not<br>specifically designed to kill. Guns are a tool, just like any other<br>tool, but their purpose is to kill.\<br>\<br>In order to stop the hype around guns, we as a nation must accept the<br>fact that killing is justified in certain circumstances (defense of self<br>and protection of liberty being the two big circumstances). Once we wrap<br>our brains around those facts, the tool we use to kill is immaterial. If<br>killing can be justified, the tool we use is either more or less<br>effective to accomplish the task. A gun would be most effective, since<br>it is purpose-built to kill.\<br>\<br>There is no need to go into the debate around whether or not we should<br>possess certain weapons, because killing is killing regardless of the<br>tool used. If criminals can possess them (and they can possess any tool<br>available), then we should have equal access to such tools. The only<br>difference is that we have disallowed public access to \"true\" assault<br>weapons (weapons which fire multiple shots with a single trigger pull,<br>and implements of war such as nuclear weapons, grenades, tanks, rocket<br>launchers, etc).]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
