**Content:** [As a matter of clarification, I\'d like to add that guns
are a popular target for the left because guns are the only tools that
are purpose-built for killing. Knives, shovels, cars, baseball bats,
etc., while useful for killing, are purpose-built for other things. They
can kill with varying levels of effectiveness, but they are not
specifically designed to kill. Guns are a tool, just like any other
tool, but their purpose is to kill.\
\
In order to stop the hype around guns, we as a nation must accept the
fact that killing is justified in certain circumstances (defense of self
and protection of liberty being the two big circumstances). Once we wrap
our brains around those facts, the tool we use to kill is immaterial. If
killing can be justified, the tool we use is either more or less
effective to accomplish the task. A gun would be most effective, since
it is purpose-built to kill.\
\
There is no need to go into the debate around whether or not we should
possess certain weapons, because killing is killing regardless of the
tool used. If criminals can possess them (and they can possess any tool
available), then we should have equal access to such tools. The only
difference is that we have disallowed public access to \"true\" assault
weapons (weapons which fire multiple shots with a single trigger pull,
and implements of war such as nuclear weapons, grenades, tanks, rocket
launchers, etc).]{.rendered_qtext}
