**Can a cop tell if you have insurance by running your plate?**

Yes and no.

In order to register your car in the first place, in most states you are
required to have a minimum amount of insurance. Police can see that your
car is registered, so therefore at the time of registration, you had
insurance.

However, it is a manual process for insurance companies to notify states
about your policy, and whether or not states accurately track that
status is up to the state. In most cases, the police do not see
*up-to-date* or *ongoing* insurance status, or that you have maintained
the *state-mandated level* of insurance. In order to receive a state
insurance card, you have to purchase the state-mandated level of
insurance. Your insurance company provides you with a state-standardized
insurance card, valid for a certain 6-month period, which shows that you
are carrying the state-mandated minimum level of insurance.

**The police cannot see that from your registration.** That information
is not maintained as part of your state driving record.

This is why you are required to carry that state-mandated insurance card
in your car (in states which require insurance) and it has to be valid.
