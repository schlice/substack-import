The answer, as with all legal questions, is "it depends," and what it
depends on is your Governing Documents.

When it comes to paint, you can be required to submit your paint color
for approval, especially if the color is changing from what it was
originally painted. Even if you are painting the same color, you still
need to get approval (although it should be pretty straightforward to
say that you're repainting the same color). And yes, they can disapprove
of your choice of color.

Putting up Christmas decorations is a different story. I'm sure some
HOAs don't allow decorations, but you could be crossing into First
Amendment-protected territory if you disallow Christmas decorations, but
you permit, say, Diwali decorations or Kwanzaa decorations or Ramadan
decorations. You'd have to disallow ***all*** decorations outside of
houses in order to stay legally okay. Most HOAs don't want to pick that
fight when they disallow religious-based decorations, so they *regulate*
decorations, not outright *ban* them. They may regulate the timeframe
you can have them up, or how big they can be, or other details, but they
probably won't outright *ban* them.

Yes, the whole point of the Architecture Approval Authority (or whatever
your HOA calls it) is to maintain a specific look of the neighborhood.
It's literally written into your Governing Documents.
