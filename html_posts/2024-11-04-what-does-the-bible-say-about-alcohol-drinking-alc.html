**BLUF:** *Drinking alcohol is fine.* ***Getting drunk*** *is not.*

Alcohol, by itself, is not sinful. Drinking alcohol is sometimes seen in
the Bible as a positive thing. Ecclesiastes 9:7 says, "Drink your wine
with a merry heart." Psalm 104:14-15 states that God gives wine "that
makes glad the heart of men." Amos 9:14 discusses drinking wine from
your own vineyard as a sign of God's blessing. Isaiah 55:1 encourages,
"Yes, come buy wine and milk..." And yes, Jesus turned water into wine.
Was He sinning then?

What the Bible warns against is ***drunkenness*** (Ephesians 5:18). The
Bible condemns drunkenness and its effects (Proverbs 23:29-35).
Christians are also commanded to not allow their bodies to be "mastered"
by anything (1 Corinthians 6:12; 2 Peter 2:19). Scripture also forbids a
Christian from doing anything that might offend other Christians or
encourage them to sin (1 Corinthians 8:9-13). All told, it would be
extremely difficult for any Christian to say that his drinking which
results in drunkenness is done "to the glory of God" (1 Corinthians
10:31).

Another practical consideration for the people of Biblical times: water
was often not sanitary. People often drank wine because the fermentation
process killed the bacteria in the water.

Drinking alcohol by itself is not sinful. It is drunkenness and addition
to alcohol that Christians must absolutely stay away from.
