**What do you think of Congress approving the MORE Act to remove the
marijuana plant from the federal Controlled Substances Act, thereby
enabling states to enact their own cannabis regulations free from
federal interference?**

*Congress* did not approve the MORE act.

The House Judiciary Committee approved the MORE act, allowing it to go
on to the full House.

The full House must pass it, at which point it will go to the Senate.

If the Senate passes it, it goes to the President's desk for signature.

If the President signs it, **then** it goes into effect.
