**Content:** [Ultimately, it\'s up to the officer to determine a safe
place to pull over. When the officer turns his lights on, the law
requires you to pull over immediately. The law does not contain
provisions for you to determine on your own that it\'s not safe to pull
over.\
\
Continuing to drive when an officer has directed you to stop risks you
being charged with evasion. For every second that you do not pull over,
you risk being charged, regardless of how many or how few seconds you
continue to drive after being directed to pull over. If you pull over
and the officer determines the area in which he stopped you is unsafe to
remain stopped, he will direct you to move.\
\
But the bottom line is that if the officer directs you to stop, stop.
Thinking you know better will only get you in more
