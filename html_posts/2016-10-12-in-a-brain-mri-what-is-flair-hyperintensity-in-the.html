FLAIR stands for "Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery" and is a pulsed
sequence used in MRIs to produce an image. Using various Time to Echo
(TE) and Response Time (TR) values, we can produce different images, as
[[BR](https://www.quora.com/profile/BR-185)]{.qlink_container}
described. The T2-weighted FLAIR image (high TR/high TE) can show us a
great deal more detail compared to older spin-density sequences (high
TR/low TE spin echo).

A "hyperintensity" is basically a white spot. In a T2-weighted FLAIR
image, a bright spot on the image is considered a hyperintensity.

**What it means** is not for us to say here. Simply saying that there is
a hyperintensity on a particular area of the brain (in your case, the
anterior pole of the right temporal lobe) signifies nothing other than
an MRI finding. It's up to the neurologist to tell you what that
hyperintensity indicates.

White matter hyperintensities in otherwise normal brains may be a cause
for concern. For you, it may be expected after brain surgery. Only your
neurologist can answer that question for you.
