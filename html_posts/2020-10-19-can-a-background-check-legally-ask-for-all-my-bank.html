**Can a background check legally ask for all my bank accounts and
brokerage information?**

A background check can legally ask for anything you give them permission
to ask for. That's what makes it *legal*. When you apply for the job,
you sign a form which allows them to do a background check. That form
will list the information they will search. You sign the form, giving
them permission to get that information. This is why it is legal.

What specifically they ask for, however, is more determined by the
employment opportunity for which a background check is needed.
Therefore, whether or not such a request is *appropriate* is determined
by the job.

For example, if you're applying to be a greeter at Walmart and they want
to do a background check and they want to have access to all of your
bank accounts and brokerage accounts, I would be highly suspect of such
a check.

However, if you were applying to be a *police officer* and they want to
do a background check and they want to have access to all of your bank
accounts and brokerage accounts, I would be suspicious if they *did not*
perform such a check.
