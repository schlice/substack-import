Yes, good grades are required. I'm going to speak specifically about the
Air Force Academy, but you can apply this same guidance generally across
all the Service Academies.

While there isn't a specific GPA you need to achieve in order to be
accepted, the recent entrants into the Air Force Academy have averaged
in the top three percent of their high school classes.

Here's the minimum of what you need out of high school in order to be
academically competitive for an appointment to the Academy:

- **Four years of English** (with a college preparatory class in
  writing)
- **Four years of math**\
  Strong background in geometry, algebra, trigonometry and precalculus.
  A solid foundation in algebra is more important that exposure to
  calculus.
- **Four years of science**\
  Lab-based and should include biology, chemistry and physics
- **Three years of social studies** (to include a course in U.S.
  history)
- **Two years of a modern foreign language**\
  We look for modern foreign languages with an emphasis on strategic
  languages such as Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, German, French,
  Portuguese and Russian. While not a modern foreign language, Latin is
  acceptable. American Sign Language is not an acceptable course.
- **One year of computer study**\
  Computer Science course or related courses that focus on coding,
  programming and web development

\

You'll also need to take the SAT and/or ACT. Again, while there aren't
specific minimums you must hit to be accepted into the Air Force
Academy, students who score below 620 Evidence-based reading and writing
or below 580 math on the SAT reasoning test and below 24 English/reading
and 25 math/science on the ACT normally will not be competitive for an
appointment *directly* into the Academy.

If you're not competitive for an appointment *directly* into the
Academy, you may be considered for an appointment to the Prep School.

\

Don't forget that academics are just one part of the overall package you
need to bring to the Academy for admissions.

If you're interested in applying to the Air Force Academy, read up on
what's required at the Admissions website:
