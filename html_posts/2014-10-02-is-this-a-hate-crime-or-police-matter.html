**Content:** [Simple police matter. No crime of any consequence has been
committed. The police would simply break up the incident and send the
ne\'er-do-wells on their way. These folks were well on their way to
committing the crime of harassment, but their behavior had not yet risen
to that level.\
\
However, the tort crime of assault has been committed, as verbal assault
is a civil offense. You would have to file suit against the
individual(s) in civil court. That\'s all on your own, there are no
arrests or police involved.\
\
Would you have gotten in trouble for calling the police? If you called
911 and told them your life was in danger and they had guns and were
shooting up the store, you could have gotten in a little bit of trouble
for misrepresenting the situation (the crime is called *false
reporting*). But if you called the local **non-emergency** number,
reported the situation, told them exactly what was going on (just as you
reported here), then they could have decided when they would send
someone, and you can\'t get in trouble for reporting exactly what you
see and what\'s going on.\
\
I will tell you this: as long as you are **truthful** with the
dispatchers and tell them exactly what you see and hear
(who/what/when/where/why/how), you will never get in trouble for calling
the police. Don\'t be afraid to call; I\'d hate for someone to decide to
not call the police because they are afraid they will get in trouble for
doing so. Also, ***learn your local municipality\'s non-emergency
number***. If you\'re ever worried about whether or not you should call
the police, call the non-emergency number.]{.rendered_qtext}
