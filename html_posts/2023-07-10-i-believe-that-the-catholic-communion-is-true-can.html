No.

According to the rules and guidelines from the Catholic Church, only
baptized Catholics are eligible to receive Communion. Non-Catholics can
come to as many Catholic Masses as they want, but they can\'t receive
Holy Communion in the Catholic Church until they become Catholic.

To receive the Eucharist, one must believe that Jesus is truly present
under the appearances of bread and wine, and must also be in communion
with the Catholic Church. Non-practicing Catholics who have negligently
not attended Mass or who have abandoned the teachings of the Church are
not in a state of grace and cannot receive Holy Communion.

Protestants can receive Holy Communion only in extreme circumstances,
such as when they are on their deathbeds.
