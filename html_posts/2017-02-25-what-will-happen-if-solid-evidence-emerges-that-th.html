This whole Russia thing has been blown so far out of proportion, that
it's bordering on the ridiculous.

Let's look at **facts** and ignore hyperbole.

- **What was done, if anything**? If anything at all was done, someone
  in the RNC (not likely Trump or Pence themseleves) colluded with
  Russia \*somehow\* and Russian hackers exposed e-mails from a private
  organization (the DNC) and gave them to WikiLeaks. The RNC staffer may
  have known that the Russians were attempting to hack the DNC. The
  staffer may have asked the Russians to get hackers to hack the DNC and
  give the details to WikiLeaks. The staffer may have even paid for
  those services.
- **Is this a crime?** It depends on how the information was obtained.
  We're assuming that the RNC didn't actually gain access to the data
  themselves, but simply asked the Russians to do it for them. The level
  of collusion is also unknown. So the crime, if any, was "conspiracy to
  commit computer fraud." The level of evidence required to prove this
  crime is quite high, and I'm certain that the FBI does not possess
  such evidence.
- **Does this rise to the level of "high crimes and misdemeanors"
  specified in the Constitution for impeachment?** It does not. First of
  all, it's highly unlikely that Trump or Pence were even personally
  involved, even if it did happen. Second, there is no affirmative "duty
  to report" a crime, so by not saying anything, *even if they knew,*
  they still did noting wrong.
- **Did anyone "hack the election?"** This is just media hyperbole. Was
  anyone claiming that voting machines were tampered with by the
  Russians? No. Was anyone claiming that the Russians participated in
  voter suppression? No. Was anyone claiming that election results, vote
  counts, or ballot tallies were tampered with? No. There was no
  "election tampering" as we know it. There was definitely an
  information campaign which included WikiLeaks leaking e-mails from the
  DNC, a private organization. No government tampering is even alleged.
  So was the election "hacked?" Not even close. In fact, both
  organizations engage in information campaigns, sometimes including
  leaked information, just usually not leaked to WikiLeaks.

It is for these reasons that I don't see how a charge rising to the
level of "high crimes and misdemeanors" could even be levied against the
President or Vice President.
