My vet, who saw this dog from the day she was 6 months old until the day
we transitioned her on to the next life, cried with us. She loved my dog
as much as I did. She pushed the injection in, and had to leave the room
because of her tears.

There is no shame in shedding a tear for ones who touched our lives as
intimately as our pets do. It shows you're human and you actually care.
That's a good thing. Vets are totally understanding. Modern vet
facilities even have a special room set aside for when we have to send
our pets on, and it has its own dedicated exit so you don't have to
traipse back through the lobby blubbering like a baby. This is a very
new design trend, and it hasn't totally caught on yet, so don't be
surprised if your vet doesn't offer this. But they should.

Original question:

It is apparent I have to put down my 14 year old dog soon. I'm not a
person who thinks pets as people. I am a realist, but I am having a
harder time than I thought. I dont want to cry in front of the vet,
techs, but the thought makes me tear up. Why?
