**Content:** [In most departments, this is allowed. However, if you are
looking at joining a police department while taking antidepressants,
make sure you are ***completely honest*** with the department about all
medications you are taking. Make sure that when you do your psych eval,
you talk to the doctor ***at length*** about why you\'re on
antidepressants, what led you to using them, and if your condition is
well-controlled on those medications.\
\
I can tell you from personal experience with this process that it is
permitted as long as the condition is well managed by a doctor and the
condition is well controlled while using the medication. The department
will want proof of this, of course, but it is allowed.]{.rendered_qtext}
