An interesting question indeed! I thought God gave me free will, but I
can't use it to choose to end my life? What kind of limited free will is
this?

The short answer is **because God wants you to exist.** But we can
understand it a little more deeply than just that. So let's address why
choosing to no longer exist is illogical.

First, **suicide is a sin.**

> 1 Corinthians 3:17 (NIV): If anyone destroys God's temple, God will
> destroy that person; for God's temple is sacred, and you together are
> that temple.

Our bodies are temples, created by God, for God. Destroying that temple
is indeed a sin.

Second, **suicide is selfish.**

*No it's not! It's selfless! I'm a burden to those around me! Their life
would be so much better without me around!*

This is fraudulent thinking. Take a look at Romans 12:

> Romans 12:1--8 (NIV): Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in
> view of God's mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy
> and pleasing to God---this is your true and proper worship. Do not
> conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the
> renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what
> God's will is---his good, pleasing and perfect will.
>
> For by the grace given me I say to every one of you: Do not think of
> yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with
> sober judgment, in accordance with the faith God has distributed to
> each of you. For just as each of us has one body with many members,
> and these members do not all have the same function, so in Christ we,
> though many, form one body, and each member belongs to all the others.
> We have different gifts, according to the grace given to each of us.
> If your gift is prophesying, then prophesy in accordance with your
> faith; if it is serving, then serve; if it is teaching, then teach; if
> it is to encourage, then give encouragement; if it is giving, then
> give generously; if it is to lead, do it diligently; if it is to show
> mercy, do it cheerfully.

This passage shows us a few things. First, God wants us to offer
ourselves as a living sacrifice. Serve others with whatever gifts you
have been given. Even if you feel like you haven't really been given any
great gifts, you can still serve others, and that's what God wants.

The other thing to notice here is to not think of yourself "more highly
than you ought." This means you shouldn't think of yourself as better
than your fellow man, but it also means that if you believe that people
are better off without you around, *you are elevating your importance in
relation to others around you,* and that is not what God wants.
Believing that your death will make everyone better off is no better
than believing that your **presence** will make everyone better. Both
are similar examples of flawed thinking.

**God wants you to exist**.

Your very presence on the earth right now is proof that God wants you to
be here. God wants us to be a living sacrifice; you can't be a *living*
sacrifice if you are no longer living.

***But you didn't answer the question. Do I have the freedom to choose
to die?***

You're right, I gave a lot of reasoning why you should stay. But does
God give us the freedom to choose to die?

**The answer is yes, you are free to choose death.** Just as you are
free to commit any sin, you are free to commit this sin, too.

But there is a problem with this particular sin: *once you commit this
sin, you can't repent of it.*

This is a problem, isn't it? As Christians, we know that once we repent
of our sin, we are forgiven. But if you're dead, you can't really repent
of your sin, and that's a problem.

It doesn't affect your salvation (which is instantaneous once you repent
and believe), but it does mean that you're committing a sin which you
have no opportunity to repent of. With every other sin, you have the
opportunity to repent and ask for forgiveness *before* you face
judgement. But with this sin, you do not.

So what does that mean? A Christian who commits suicide will still go to
heaven, but he will have to account for that sin himself (that sin is
not forgiven), and you will face consequences that we don't fully know
or understand.

How does that honor God's grace? We honor God's grace with our worship
and living a Christ-centered life, but how does a final defiant act do
that? We dishonor God when we make that choice, because we take his
grace for granted. We bank on the fact that our salvation is assured,
but we can commit sin and allow it to remain unresolved before we face
God in our judgement. That's really reckless.

If we're so confident in God's grace (his grace will see me through this
sin), why are we not as confident that God's grace will see us through
our suffering *while we're still alive?* Conversely, if we're doubtful
that God's grace will see us through our suffering while we're alive,
*can we really be confident that God's grace will see us into heaven
after we commit a final, unrepented sinful act?* And if we are doubtful
of our salvation, then suicide is *extremely risky* because it's so
final. You have no further opportunity for repentance.

So yes, you have the freedom to make the choice to no longer exist. But
as you can see by this analysis, that's an extremely risky position, and
it doesn't make logical sense.

Why doesn\'t God give us a choice to cease to exist?
