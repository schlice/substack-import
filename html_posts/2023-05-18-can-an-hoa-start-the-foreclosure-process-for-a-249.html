If, by "start the foreclosure process," you mean that they can send the
\$249 debt to the HOA attorney for collection instead of trying to
collect themselves, the general answer is yes. Sending the debt to the
attorney allows them to place a lien on the property, and if the debt
goes uncollected, to foreclose on the lien to pay it.

Some states limit the amount of money owed before an HOA can send the
debt to collections or to the attorney, to prevent runaway HOAs from not
working things out before moving to liens and foreclosure. For example,
Florida Statutes limit HOAs to \$1000 in debt before a lien can be
placed. **But most states do not**. Most states allow liens to be placed
on debts as low as \$1.
