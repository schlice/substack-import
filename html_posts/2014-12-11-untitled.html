<h2>Answer Comment</h2>
<div>

**Content:** [If you are capable of fairness, then why must the evidence
become public?\
\
It sounds like you\'d prefer that a grand jury not hear the case, but
that the case be tried in the court of public opinion.\
\
If you were truly only concerned about fairness, you\'d be looking at
the composition of the grand jury, who the jurors were, and whether or
not they were capable of fairness. That should be sufficient for you.\
\
But it seems like you wanted this to go to trial simply so the evidence
would be made public. Most of it has already.\
\
But the family has to get their \"pound of flesh,\" so you\'ll probably
see your evidence in the wrongful death lawsuit that should follow
soon.]{.rendered_qtext}
