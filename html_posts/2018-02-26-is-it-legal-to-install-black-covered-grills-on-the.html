**Is it legal to install black-covered grills on the headlight, tail
light, and indicators?**

Generally, any modifications you make to the car cannot impede the
operation of any required features. You can *possibly* install black
grills on the lights. Each state has different requirements for how much
light must be visible and at what distances, and what treatments may be
applied to lights. Check with your state laws regarding safety equipment
and what modifications you are allowed to make.

**Will I need to pay a fine to the Motor Vehicle Department if I install
them?**

If you willfully violate your state's laws and you receive an equipment
violation from your police department, you don't pay the DMV. You pay
the state, since you violated a state law. Generally, your remittance
goes back to the state department of revenue.
