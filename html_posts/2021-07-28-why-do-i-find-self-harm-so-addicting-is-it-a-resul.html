There are six main reasons why people self-harm:

> 1.  Distract themselves, alter the focus of their attention, or regain
>     control over their minds when experiencing pressing, unavoidable
>     and overwhelming feelings or thoughts.
> 2.  Release tension associated with strong emotions or overwhelming
>     thoughts.
> 3.  Feel something physical when they are otherwise dissociated and
>     numb.
> 4.  Express themselves or communicate and/or document strong emotions
>     they are feeling and cannot otherwise articulate.
> 5.  Punish themselves.
> 6.  Experience a temporary but intense feeling of euphoria that occurs
>     in the immediate aftermath of
>     self-harm.[\[1\]](#AptoN){#cite-AptoN .citation_link}

It seems like you may be discussing reason number six. I think it\'s
like what runners call a \"runner\'s high\"; a temporary good feeling
that occurs right after you\'ve worked out. Except here, the good
feeling happens after self-harm. The self-harmer remembers that
"runner\'s high" and wants to self-injure again to re-create that
feeling.

Here's a few things you can do to help you break the cycle of self-harm:

> - **Name your reason for hurting yourself and your reason for
>   quitting.** Ask yourself: "What do I feel before, during, and after
>   self-injury? Which of those emotions do I actively seek out, and
>   which are harmful?"
> - **Identify other ways of achieving the same result.** For example,
>   if you self-harm for the physical sensation, seek other ways of
>   releasing endorphins, like exercise. For real, try throwing a few
>   punches at a kickboxing class or tapping it back in a spin class
>   with the \*perfect\* playlist. If you self-harm to express your
>   emotions, practice expressing them in words by writing them down.
>   Grab a pen and your favorite notebook, or start typing away in your
>   notes app.
> - **Tackle the underlying emotions.** Explore the feelings that lead
>   you to want to hurt yourself. If it's guilt, where is that guilt
>   coming from? Maybe try finding a therapist---there are pros trained
>   specifically to help with this.
> - **Tell someone you trust.** Let a friend, family member, or trusted
>   adult know what you're going through and that you need their
>   support. Opening up to people can be easier said than done. Here's a
>   place to start: "I'm having a hard time processing some painful
>   emotions and I could use your support right
>   now."[\[2\]](#CEMvy){#cite-CEMvy .citation_link}

Don't discount the benefit of therapy. Finding a professional who can
help you sort through the feelings *causing* you to self-harm in the
first place would be beneficial. Like the second article said, there are
pros who deal specifically with self-harm who can help you through it.

Who knows, you may become the next adrenaline junkie doing like base
jumping or bungee jumping off of high bridges.

But ultimately, talk to someone. There is help. You can get a rush
without drugs or self-harm. Please think seriously about talking to
someone. Use the resources in the box on this page titled "There is
Help" to get started.

Good luck!
