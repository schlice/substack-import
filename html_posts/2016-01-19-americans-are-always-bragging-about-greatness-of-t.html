I have to agree with [[Arttu
Holappa](https://www.quora.com/profile/Arttu-Holappa)]{.qlink_container}
here. The measure of greatness of a country does not, in my mind,
necessarily include percentage of the population in prison. And while
this is mostly true (Seychelles actually ranks higher than the US \"per
capita\" as the question states, but Seychelles has such a small
population that their incarceration rate gets unfairly overblown per
capita, I don\'t even think they count), there are several reasons why
the US has the largest population of people in prison:

1.  The US has longer jail sentences than other countries.
2.  The US has \"three-strike rules\" which mean that repeat offenders
    are guaranteed to spend much longer in prison.
3.  The US has \"mandatory sentencing\" rules which take the sentencing
    out of the hands of the judge and places it in the hands of the
    legislature. Mandatory sentences also keep people in prison for
    longer periods of time.
4.  The \"war on drugs\" has (unfairly, in my opinion) incarcerated drug
    users at a significantly higher rate than you can find in nearly any
    other country in the world. More than half of the population of all
    US jails and prisons is comprised of drug abusers. *This should not
    happen, and is the biggest reason we have the highest incarceration
    rate in the world.*

In my opinion, we should not incarcerate drug **users.** Definitely
incarcerate drug **dealers** and drug **manufacturers.** But drug users?
They\'re addicts. They should be *patients*, not *prisoners.*
