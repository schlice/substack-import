**I have MS and My cognitive function has changed dramatically yet there
are no changes on my MRI. How can this happen? Is there any treatment
for it?**

Thanks for your question.

Cognitive changes (such as the ability to learn and remember
information, organize, plan and problem-solve, focus, maintain and shift
attention, understand and use language, accurately perceive the
environment, and perform calculations) are common in MS. More than half
of all people diagnosed with MS will experience some cognitive change.

Certain areas of cognition are more likely to be impacted than others by
the MS disease course:

- Information processing (dealing with information gathered by the five
  senses)
- Memory (acquiring, retaining and retrieving new information)
- Attention and concentration (particularly divided attention)
- Executive functions (planning and prioritizing)
- Visuospatial functions (visual perception and constructional
  abilities)
- Verbal fluency (word-finding)

Cognitive changes are not correlated with other disease activity. People
with mild motor function changes can have a great deal of cognitive
changes, while people with severe motor function issues may have very
little cognitive impairment. What we do know about cognitive changes:

- Changes can occur at any time --- even as a first symptom of MS ---
  but are more common later in the disease.
- Cognitive function correlates with number of lesions and lesion area
  on MRI, as well as brain atrophy.
- Cognitive dysfunction can occur with any disease course, but is
  slightly more likely in progressive MS.
- You are more likely to experience cognitive dysfunction (the first
  signs or new changes) during an exacerbation.
- Cognitive changes generally progress slowly. They are unlikely to
  improve dramatically once they have begun.

Now, on to what you can do.

First thing, talk to your neurologist! There are a great deal of
interventions that can be implemented which will assist your cognitive
functioning. And based on what we know about the growing science of
[[neuroplasticity](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4ddb25&url=https://www.thebestbrainpossible.com/your-life-shapes-your-brain/){.external_link

qt-tooltip="thebestbrainpossible.com"}]{.qlink_container}, there is a
chance that the brain can be "re-wired" to work around the damaged
areas, and to basically learn new ways to function.

However, with all of this, cognitive changes are not routinely discussed
or adequately treated. This is one of the major "unmet" areas of MS
treatment, because people tend to not talk about it with their
neurologists.

Your neurologist will order a series of cognitive tests to evaluate your
cognitive ability and make recommendations on rehabilitation, which
includes a combination of **restorative** and **compensatory**
activities.

> **Restorative activities** can include learning and memory exercises:
>
> - **Combine modes of learning:** You will be more likely to remember
>   something if you "see it, say it, hear it, write it, do it." It's
>   okay to give yourself extra time.
> - **Repeat & verify:** Repeat what you hear and verify that it is
>   correct to improve your attention and memory.
> - **Spaced rehearsal**: Repeat and practice information at intervals
>   spread out over time to improve your ability to store information.
> - **Build associations:** Use memory aids! For example, to remember
>   the name of someone you just met, associate her/his name with a
>   friend or family member of the same name, or with a place, color or
>   event that sounds like the new name.
>
> **Compensatory activities** that help make up for functions that are
> no longer working well may include:
>
> - **Consolidate and centralize!** Designate one place in your home as
>   the "Grand Central" information center. Include your master
>   calendar, mail, bills, phone messages, to-do lists, keys, wallet,
>   shopping lists and more.
> - **Plan:** Post a calendar large enough to display everyone's
>   appointments, activities and social engagements, and reminders! Keep
>   pens or markers hanging right beside it. Or use a computer program
>   set up with reminders for routine tasks (synchronize it with your
>   mobile devices so you have your appointments with you while on the
>   go).
> - **Record:** Dictate your to-do list, notes or other things to
>   remember on a digital voice recorder (available on many phones).
> - **Remind:** Use checklists, the alarm on your watch or phone, your
>   kitchen timer, and more.
> - **Eliminate or remove yourself from distractions.** Turn off the TV,
>   music and whatever else is "on" when speaking with someone in person
>   or on the phone. Background visual and noise distractions can make
>   learning or remembering more difficult. If you can't eliminate the
>   distraction (for example, people talking at a party) then ask, "Can
>   we talk in a quieter place?"
> - **Take a break.** If you are having difficulty concentrating, take a
>   breath and refresh.
> - **Do one thing at a time.** Avoid switching back and forth from one
>   topic or task to another. Finish or find an appropriate stopping
>   place in what you're working on before you switch to something
>   else.[\[1\]](#zGzrV){#cite-zGzrV .citation_link}
