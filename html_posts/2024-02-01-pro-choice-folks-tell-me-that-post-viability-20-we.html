As you can see in this infographic, "vanishingly small" means 1%:

So "never" is not accurate. Less than 1 in 100 abortions occurs post 20
weeks. That's not "never," but it is pretty rare. So when lawmakers even
propose "Draconian" 15-week abortion limits, this still allows \~95% of
abortions to continue to legally take place.

The other problem is that "viability" is a moving target. First, less
than 30% of babies born earlier than 22 weeks survive. So viability
means "a minimum starting point before which survival outside of the
mother's womb is, using current technology, virtually impossible."
Second, as technology improves, so too will the date of viability.
Already, experiments with an artificial womb are proving fruitful,
meaning that babies will soon be able to survive after being removed
from the mother even earlier than 20 weeks:

Technology will soon obviate the need to kill babies, as we will be able
to transfer them into an artificial womb. Then, there will be no need to
kill them, and the mother can be free of them if she wishes.

So ultimately, I believe that this debate will end with technology.
Abortion will become outdated and unnecessary, as pregnant women who no
longer want to be pregnant will simply have their baby transferred to an
artificial womb.
