**Christians seem to ask a lot of questions about why atheists don't
believe in their God. Are these Christians actually curious about
atheists, or are they perhaps showing a bit of uncertainty about their
own faith?**

Actually, Christians may be testing their apologetics legs by trying to
engage atheists in a little bit of gamesmanship.

Asking an atheist to ground their belief is the first step in a game of
arguing the four classic proofs for God's existence (cosmological,
teleological, moral, and ontological), and asking an atheist why they
don't believe in God is the first step towards asking them to ground
their belief.
