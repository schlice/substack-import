Yes, but it doesn't really work like that. It happens because of a lot
of failure to communicate, and that is usually *willingly* failing to
communicate.

If you don't pay your dues, or if you get fines or fees added to your
account that you don't pay, those charges will add up and you will start
to accrue late fees. Those fees continue to add up to a certain point,
at which your delinquent account is turned over to the association's
attorney. Along with what you've already accumulated, you then begin to
accrue the attorney's fees.

After a certain amount of time has passed, the HOA will place a *lien*
on your property. And if you allow your account to continue to remain
delinquent, the HOA will *foreclose* on your lien, selling your house
out from under you, so that they get their money and the attorney gets
paid.

It takes a long time and a lot of communication to allow your account to
go that far delinquent. Usually, it's willing (usually, homeowners say
something like, "I'm not going to talk to those HOA fools; they can't do
anything to me"), but sometimes it's not. Often, it's just the letter
from the attorney which says that the delinquent account has been turned
over to them which gets them communicating and working on a get-well
plan. But some people are pretty obstinate and flat-out refuse to
cooperate. Those are the people who lose their houses out from under
them.

In my time on HOA Boards, I have seen that happen *exactly once*. It is
a pretty rare occurrence, and this guy was a real piece of work, if you
know what I mean. He ended up getting arrested on domestic violence
charges, *and he was a well-known attorney in our area at the time!* He
truly thought he was smarter than everyone and he didn't have to pay his
dues or fines. He's now sitting in a jail cell. Go figure.
