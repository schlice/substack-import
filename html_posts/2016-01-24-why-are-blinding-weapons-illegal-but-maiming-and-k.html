Remember that military rifle rounds are jacketed, meaning under most
circumstances, they do not deform when striking human flesh. In many
cases, the bullet will go \"through and through,\" make a clean puncture
wound, effectively removing that soldier from the fight, but increasing
(as much as possible) the chance that the soldier can be patched up and
still live. This is a type of weapon that is acceptable in war (insofar
as any weapon of war is \"acceptable\").

Laser weapons cause permanent blindness. Weapons which don\'t simply
remove a soldier from the fight, but even in the best case leave a
soldier permanently blind, are not considered to be valid weapons of
war. An alternative would be a bright enough strobe light that could
temporarily blind a troop but leave no permanent damage like a laser. We
have such a weapon, it is called the
