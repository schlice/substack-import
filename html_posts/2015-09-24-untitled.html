<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [From personal experience, I can tell you that the deer
population is particularly fascinated by headlights, and do like to
stare at them as they approach.\
\
Thus the phrase, \"he had that deer-in-the-headlights look to him.\"\
\
We always suggested that you flash your lights at *oncoming traffic*,
after you pass the deer. Otherwise, they\'ll just stop and
stare.]{.rendered_qtext}
