First, it's because many people call themselves Christian, maybe even
attend church every week, *but are not saved*. Our pastor once estimated
that as many as 40% of the people who attend our church may not be
saved. Note this is a rough estimate and it's not based on any empirical
data, but it goes to show you that just because you call yourself a
Christian doesn't mean you're saved.

Why is this important? A saved person, a person who has confessed
himself or herself as a sinner and has accepted Jesus as their Lord and
Savior, will act differently.

Saved people have had "their hearts of stone" replaced with hearts of
love, which will always love Jesus. Saved people will desire to live out
the Great Commission. Saved people will seek out opportunities to serve.

But most crucially to this discussion, ***saved people know that being a
Christian is not comfortable.***

> "I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In
> this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the
> world." --- John 16:33 NIV

Jesus was clear: the world is *uncomfortable*. The world will hate you.
The world will reject you. **And that's okay,** because while the saved
person is *in* the world, they are not *of* the world. The world will
reject those who do not belong to it. The world will reject those who
continue to be *uncomfortable* in a world in which they only need to
follow the dictates of their feelings and they'd be comfortable.

But that's not our calling. Our calling is to not bow to the dictate of
our feelings. Our calling is to not fear the uncomfortable. Our calling
is to step outside of our comfort zone and to boldly proclaim the
Gospel. That's not easy, and it's certainly not comfortable.

TL;DR: Those who call themselves Christian come in many different
flavors, but those who are *saved* are a smaller group of Christians,
and they are the ones who live *uncomfortably*, living to worship God
and serve others, and to spread the Gospel to the world.
