**If using Tails OS and maintaining proper Opsec, what would be the
chances of being de-anonymized by the FBI and NSA?**

TAILS (The Amnesic Incognito Live System) has as its primary purpose
leaving no trace on the host computer. It also can communicate over TOR
networks using a TOR Browser. You don't need TAILS to be anonymous
online. Using the TOR Browser and being careful with what you access is
all you need for anonymous browsing.

Using the [[TOR
Browser](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=fc2a38&url=https://www.torproject.org/download/){.external_link

Install and go. Watching where you log in to is more critical. For
example, if you use TOR to log in to your Gmail account, then they at
least know you logged in to your Gmail account. They may not know from
where, but they do know you logged in. So the OPSEC you discuss in your
question is critical. In other words, you're more likely to be
de-anonymized by the site you visit than you are by having your TOR
circuit back-traced. At best, they can tell you connected to a TOR entry
node, but even that packet is encrypted, so what you said and where you
went from there is still a mystery.

There was talk for a while about the NSA having sleeper nodes in the TOR
network, but even a sleeper node would still need to decrypt the entire
packet, and you'd only be able to do that if you had the private keys of
all three nodes in the circuit. Since you randomly generate a circuit
(and can do so again at any time), having all three private keys is
highly unlikely.

As I said at the beginning, the primary purpose of TAILS is to be able
to use any computer and leave no trace. Indeed, you can do this with
nearly any version of Linux which has a Live installer, such as Ubuntu.
What sets TAILS apart is that it has security inbuilt, so it boots into
a live session, AND uses a TOR circuit by default, AND communicates over
a TOR Browser. It also cleans memory and ensures that nothing is ever
communicate to the local hard drive at all. And unless you specifically
enable it, nothing is written to the USB stick either.

So to answer the question: **If using Tails OS and maintaining proper
Opsec, what would be the chances of being de-anonymized by the FBI and
NSA?**

If you did each one of those things perfectly, *virtually zero*. I'm in
Tech Support and I know better than to assure you that it will never
happen (remember, nothing is foolproof to the talented fool), but it is
so unlikely that it is *effectively* zero.
