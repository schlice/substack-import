Thanks for the A2A.

First, it\'s important to understand that we have made **major**
progress in the treatment of this disease over the last roughly 40
years. Before then, we didn\'t have a way to slow down the disease at
all. Medicine could only treat the symptoms of the disease, and not very
effectively either. We\'ve known about MS and recognized symptoms of the
disease for more than 300 years. Having the first real advances in
treatment of the disease just happening within the last 30 years is
astonishing.

Starting about 25 years ago, some of the first MS treatments were
introduced. They are a class of medications called
***immunomodulators***. Primarily, they modulate (or modify) the immune
response using *interferons*. Interferons are naturally-occurring
proteins secreted by cells in the immune system. These interferons are
not well understood, but we understood them well enough to create
medications which can *modulate* the immune system response. The early
MS medicines (Avonex, Betaseron) are interferons that modulate how the
immune system responds to nerve cells, slowing down their attacks on
myelin. Other immunomodulators like Copaxone are synthetic proteins
which mimic the protein structure of myelin. When immune cells bind to
Copaxone\'s synthetic protein, they create anti-inflammatory cells
rather than the inflammatory cells created when immune cells bind to
myelin.

A host of other MS medicines have been introduced, including the latest
medicines, oral medications. Finally, something to treat MS, in a pill!

While none of these are *cures*, we have progressed the medications such
that a person diagnosed with MS today can expect roughly the same
lifespan as someone without MS, and can also enjoy an acceptable quality
of life, with some lifestyle modifications. Incidence of severe
disability is low (around 10%), so most people with MS will continue
being normal, active people.

Now, on to specifically what you asked: what progress has been made
towards a **cure**? Until we can identify a **cause**, we can\'t think
about identifying a **cure**. We know epidemiologically that there is a
hormonal component (as women get MS two to three times more frequently
than men), there is a familial component (close first-degree relatives
of someone with MS have a higher chance of developing the disease),
there is a geographical component (living at higher than 40 degrees
latitude poses a greater risk of developing the disease), and there is
an ethnic component (whites of eastern European descent are most likely
to get the disease). We know that vitamin D has prophylactic qualities,
and studies have shown that many MS patients also have very low vitamin
D levels, and generally cannot maintain normal vitamin D levels without
supplementation. We also know that there is some infectious trigger that
initiates the disease process in a person who is predisposed to getting
the disease. Beyond that, we still do not know what defect causes the
immune system to attack normal, healthy body cells.

We have learned much more over the past 15 years about T cells, which
are the primary aggressors against myelin. There are three broad
categories of T cells:

- Helper T cells which recognize foreign antigens and activate other T
  cells
- Regulatory T cells which do the opposite, or \"turn off\" other immune
  functions
- Cytotoxic or \"Killer\" T cells which attack and destroy antigenic
  cells.

What we\'ve found over the last 15 years is interesting regarding the
blood of MS patients when compared to healthy persons:

- Decreased regulatory T cells in peripheral blood during an attack
- Increased helper T cells in CSF (cerebrospinal fluid)
- Increased activated T cells crossing the blood-brain barrier, which
  then attracts other immune cells
- Increased T cell activity against myelin
- T cells found in MS plaques (scars) on nerves

So what does all of this mean for treatment and potentially a cure? The
MS Society says the following (emphasis mine):

I am actually using one such drug \-- Gilenya. Gilenya works by trapping
certain T cells within lymph nodes and not allowing them to leave and
attack the nerve cells. Not all T cells are affected, but enough T cells
are trapped in lymph nodes to slow down the progression of the disease.

I think we are just a few years away from having therapies that directly
target the progression of MS while leaving other immune cells untouched.
We\'re very close today. So we are rapidly approaching a time where we
can directly target the cause of the symptoms of the disease, even if we
haven\'t yet found the actual cause of the immune-mediated response yet.

I have said since the beginning, if I was to get MS at any time in
history, this isn\'t the worst time to get it.
