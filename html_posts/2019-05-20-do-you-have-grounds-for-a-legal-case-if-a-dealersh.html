**Do you have grounds for a legal case if a dealership sells you a car
that experiences a critical mechanical failure a week later related to
an error code that has been cleared in its computer?**

You might. No one here can tell you whether or not you have a case,
because that would be considered *specific legal advice*, and we can't
give you that.

However, car dealerships are required to disclose any and all issues
that they are aware of with the vehicle, otherwise it may be considered
fraud by non-disclosure. More specifically, dealers are required to
disclose anything which might affect the value or desirability of a
vehicle, and failure to inform the customer that the vehicle had a
pre-existing mechanical issue may be covered, especially if it was the
dealership who cleared that code without fixing that issue.

Contact an attorney in your area who pursues fraud claims. Most of them
work on a contingency basis, which means that you can usually retain one
with little to no up-front cost (they'll only get paid when they collect
for you).
