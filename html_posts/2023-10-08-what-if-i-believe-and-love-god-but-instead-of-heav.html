No.

And even worse, now that you know God and you love God, you can only
either believe in Him or reject Him. If you reject the God you know and
love, you doom yourself to hell.

Don't worry, your eternity will be as quiet and restful as you like. But
"returning to nothing" is not what we have as our eternal destiny.

If you love and believe God, then trust Him to give you exactly what you
need, exactly when you need it. And that even means when your day comes.
If you believe and love God, then you obey God as well.
