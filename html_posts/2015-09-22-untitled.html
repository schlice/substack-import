**Content:** [They don\'t need to amend the Constitution. The Supreme
Court already ruled on these laws, and they found that the laws don\'t
actually infringe on the right of the people to keep and bear arms.\
\
Had the Supreme Court overturned these laws and stated that the word
\"infringed\" meant that no one can write any law whatsoever regarding
guns, then if people actually wanted to pass a law, they would have no
choice but to amend the Constitution.\
\
As it stands, different courts over the years have all held the same
opinion: reasonable gun laws do not infringe on your right to keep and
bear arms.\
\
Therefore, there is no need to amend the Constitution.\
\
Look at it this way: the anti-gun lobby wants to ultimately turn America
into the UK or Australia and make guns illegal for citizens to own. Laws
like these would most definitely be found to be unconstitutional. Look
at Washington, D.C.\'s handgun ban. This was actually found to be
unconstitutional, and was overturned because it prevented citizens from
owning guns. So for those citizens who want to make guns illegal, they
will indeed need a Constitutional amendment which overturns the 2nd
Amendment.\
\
We don\'t currently need a Constitutional amendment to change the word
\"infringed\" because we still have the right to keep and bear
arms.]{.rendered_qtext}
