A Taser is a "conducted energy weapon" (CEW), the most common version in
law enforcement and civilian use manufactured by TASER International.
Taser began its development in 1969 by Jack Cover, a NASA engineer. It
is named after Jack's favorite childhood hero, Tom Swift. The TASER is
an acronym which stands for "Thomas A. Swift's Electronic Rifle." The
original Taser (called the Taser Public Defender), released in 1974,
used gunpowder as its propellant, leading the BATF to classify it as a
firearm. In 1993, Rick and Thomas Smith began working with Cover to
create a non-firearm conducted energy weapon, the first non-firearm
Taser being released in 1994.

The Taser works by delivering electrical current across conductors to
induce "involuntary neuromuscular incapacitation." The result of this is
loss of muscle control, involuntary muscle movement (twitching), and
pain. The sensory and motor nerves quickly get overloaded by the
electricity.

The Taser can operate in one of two modes: normal barb discharge mode,
and "Drive Stun" mode. In normal mode, the unit deploys two darts
propelled using compressed nitrogen and connected back to the unit using
electrical filament wire. The upper dart deploys straight out from the
unit, while the lower dart is slightly canted downward, to achieve a
degree of spread between the darts. The darts and nitrogen charge are
contained in a replaceable cartridge. The standard Taser unit in use
today, the X26, loads a single cartridge at a time. Also deployed from
the Taser cartridge are an "anti-felon identification" (AFID) system,
many small confetti-sized paper circles with the serial number of the
cartridge printed on them.

The second mode of operation on law enforcement units is a "Drive Stun"
mode. This mode operates much in the same way as a traditional "stun
gun". Drive stun mode works with no cartridge installed, or with a
deployed cartridge in place. It produces pain only, none of the
neuromuscular effects. After being found to be largely ineffective, most
departments no longer use Tasers in drive stun mode.

Taser has developed an X3 model, which uses much thinner cartridges and
holds three of them, allowing three shots before needing to be reloaded.
