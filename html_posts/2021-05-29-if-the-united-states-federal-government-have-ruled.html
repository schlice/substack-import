**If the United States federal government have ruled that companies may
mandate the Covid vaccine, how will that affect the states that have
banned making it mandatory?**

Whoa there, don't put the cart before the horse.

Your article simply reports that the Federal Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission (EEOC) stated that their rules (surrounding equal
employment opportunity) do not prevent companies from mandating that all
employees which enter a workplace be vaccinated, so long as employers
comply with the reasonable accommodation provisions of the Americans
with Disabilities Act and other laws.

This paves the way for employers to mandate all employees be vaccinated
***once the drug is fully approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration.*** They ***still*** can't mandate its use ***today***.

Today, these drugs are only approved under an Emergency Use
Authorization, and *that* Federal law says that ***vaccination must be
voluntary***. Forcing an employee to get vaccinated in order to retain
their employment would be coercing an employee into violating Federal
law (taking a vaccine against their will). If the only reason they are
taking the vaccine is to retain their employment, and they otherwise
refuse to take the vaccine, this would be a violation of Federal law.
All states have laws which prevent employers from legally firing
employees for refusing to violate Federal law.
