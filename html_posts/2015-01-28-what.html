**Content:** [In Colorado, the state certifies peace officers statewide.
All academy courses must be approved by the Colorado POST (Peace Officer
Standardization and Training) Board. Once you complete the course, the
training staff sends the list of persons who have completed the course
back to the POST Board, which approves the list and allows those listed
persons to be sworn as Colorado peace officers. Anyone trained and sworn
after having been trained in a POST-approved course is considered a
Colorado peace officer, regardless of designation or
agency.]{.rendered_qtext}
