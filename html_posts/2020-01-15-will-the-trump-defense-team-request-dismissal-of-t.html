**Will the Trump defense team request dismissal of the impeachment for
lack of showing constitutional cause after the house managers present
their case?**

Again, this all goes back to the fallacy that this is a trial.

***THIS IS NOT A TRIAL***.

The Senate will not function as a courtroom. I know it gets confusing
because the Chief Justice will be presiding as the chair, but that's
only because it would be a conflict of interest for the President of the
Senate to preside. In case you missed Constitution 101, the President of
the Senate is the Vice President. The last time we had an impeachment
"trial" in the Senate, Chief Justice Rehnquist admonished the Managers
to not refer to Senators as "jurors," because they are specifically not
jurors, and this is not a trial.

To that end, the defense team can ask the Senate to immediately vote to
dismiss the impeachment, but it's unlikely that the Senate will do that.
Why? The Senate could have done that already, without having to go
through the rigmarole of setting up the hearing and waiting for the
House to get off of its arse and send over the Articles.

The Senate is going to allow the hearing to move forward.

The Managers who present in the President's defense will undoubtedly use
that line of reasoning while they present their case.

It's unlikely that anything the Managers say will have any sway on any
Senator in that room. I suspect the vote will come out exactly as we
suspect: the President will not be removed from office.

End of impeachment. Everyone go back to your lives. And hopefully
Congress can get back to work fixing the nation's ills.
