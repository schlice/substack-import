**Content:** [So you may have noticed that Quora added a big box to your
question. Your question contained the word \"suicide\" so you got a big
splash box.\
\
You should definitely take that advice. Encourage him to talk to
someone.\
\
You should also learn the warning signs of an impending suicide.\
]{.rendered_qtext}

- Watch for him giving prized possessions away and putting financial
  affairs in order.\
- Watch for a noticeable mood change, as if a big burden has been
  lifted. This may mean he has made the tough decision to end his life.
- Listen to his speech. If he sounds like he is calling people to say
  goodbye, this is an additional warning sign.

If you ever feel he is a danger to himself, don\'t hesitate. Call 911
right away.\
\
I should also add that I can appreciate what [[Bill
Boland](https://www.quora.com/profile/Bill-Boland-2)]{.qlink_container}
shared, and so I feel I would be remiss if I don\'t mention that he is
in a very bad place right now, and while this is his decision to make, I
don\'t believe that suicide is ever the answer. I believe that all lives
have value, and that all lives can be lived in a way that continues to
value the life that is yet to be lived.
