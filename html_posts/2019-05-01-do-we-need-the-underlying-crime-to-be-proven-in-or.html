Thanks for the A2A, [[Hazel

I'm not sure what more I can add to the other answers here, but I'll
give it a crack since you asked.

**Does the underlying crime need to be proven in order to be guilty of
obstruction? No,** it does not. Obstruction charges will stand on their
own regardless of whether or not the underlying crime, the investigation
of which the person is attempting to obstruct, is actually proven.

However, t*he presence or absence of the underlying crime* does indeed
make a difference, as it speaks to *intent*.

One of the elements of obstruction of justice, which must be proven
beyond a reasonable doubt, is that the alleged obstructor must have
acted **with corrupt intent**. This means that the alleged obstructor
knew that a crime was committed, and corruptly attempted to stop,
confound, confuse, or obfuscate the investigation into that crime. The
lack of an underlying crime implies that the alleged obstructor could
not have acted with corrupt intent, since there was no underlying crime
into which he was obstructing an investigation.

In other words, you can't intend to stop the investigation into a
non-crime, because a non-crime never happened.
