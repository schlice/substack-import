Your Governing Documents (more specifically, your Bylaws) contain all
the information about when elections must be held and how residents must
be notified about those elections. Read your Bylaws and make sure your
HOA is abiding by them.

If you are not getting answers, request (in writing) a meeting with the
Board. As a resident, you have the right to meet with the Board.

If they are still unresponsive, you may be forced to bring legal action
against the Board (as is your right as a resident) for failing to act in
the best interests of the community, perform its duties reasonably and
fairly, and not act in a discriminatory or capricious manner. Failing to
meet with homeowners when requested and provide governance information,
in an apparent attempt to prevent homeowners from seeking nomination to
run for a Board position, would definitely qualify. Also, if the Board
is not holding fair elections in accordance with the Bylaws, this is
also grounds for legal action. While you hope that it would never come
to legal action, sometimes a recalcitrant Board must be compelled into
action.
