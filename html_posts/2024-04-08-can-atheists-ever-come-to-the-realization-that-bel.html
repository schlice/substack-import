The problem is not that proof exists. The problem is what proof atheists
will accept.

Most atheists are looking for "observable, verifiable and repeatable
evidence" for the existence of God, but this is illogical. Concrete
evidence of a non-concrete God is kinda silly, wouldn't you say? It's
like using a metal detector to find a plastic cup.

It's not that religious folks *won't* provide you the concrete evidence
of God's existence that you want, **no one can**, because God is not
"concrete."

If God even exists, and if theists are correct that He created the
universe, He must exist outside of the universe, because you must be
outside of a thing in order to create the thing. Since all time, all
space, and all matter were created with the creation of the universe at
the Big Bang, God must be *outside* of all of those things. If He is
outside of time, then He has no beginning or no end (He is "timeless"),
and if He is outside of space and matter, then He is immaterial (He has
no form or matter). So if God actually created the universe, then He is
***necessarily*** immaterial and eternal.

So you're never going to find concrete evidence of God's existence.
You're never going to discover one of God's hairs, or see one of God's
footprints. *But that doesn't mean you can't prove beyond a reasonable
doubt that God exists*. You just have to use different tools to do it.
Because we know that things exist which are not concrete, but we are all
rational to believe in. For example, you can't prove using science that
a sunset is beautiful or that the Nazis were evil. But we are all
rational to believe in beauty and morality, despite the fact that
science cannot prove them.

What's more, you can't even prove the assertion that *the scientific
method accurately produces truth* using the scientific method. You just
assume (without evidence) that it does.

There is plenty of proof that belief in a God is rational and logical.
It's just not the kind of "proof" demanded by atheists. They've set the
rules so narrowly that any non-material explanation automatically fails.
