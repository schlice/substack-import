Wow, I know I've seen "questions" with incorrect statements, but this
one is just full of them.

Let's start from the beginning:

> Trump\'s Supreme Court

It's not Trump's Supreme Court. Every president, while he is in office,
has the power to appoint Supreme Court justices if vacancies occur
during his tenure. That doesn't make it the President's court. Supreme
Court justices are beholden to the Constitution, not to a president.
That's why they are appointed for life; they don't have to appease
anyone or vie for political points to make voters happy. They only have
to do what is right by the Constitution.

> \[The\] Supreme Court ruling on abortion now affects all health issues
> of women in anti-abortion states,

No it doesn't. It only says that abortion is not a Constitutional right.
**THAT'S IT.** Nothing else. The decision returns control of whether or
not, and when, a state will allow abortions back to the states and their
elected officials. The power is returned to the people.

> now any medical issue like cancer can be tied to abortion

Under what legal doctrine? Are you trying to suggest that treatment for
cancer causes abortions?

Because that's not how doctors see it. If the mother undergoes
lifesaving treatment, and the baby dies as a result, **this is not an
abortion**. Intentionally taking medical steps to kill a baby in the
womb is an abortion. Saving the mother's life which *incidentally*
results in the death of the baby **is not an abortion*. There's an
ocean's worth of difference between saving the mother's life and the
baby dying as a result, and intentionally killing the baby.***

> and the female patient arrested for attempted murder.

No, the mother is not arrested. If a doctor performs an illegal
abortion, the penalty is against the doctor, never against the mother.
