Sprinters and distance runners develop notoriously different muscle
fibers.

People have two different types of skeletal muscle fibers: fast twitch
and slow twitch. Fast twitch muscle fibers are quicker, more explosive,
but tire out faster. Slow twitch muscle fibers are, well, slower, but
are better for longer distance workouts.

During aerobic exercise, slow twitch muscle fibers are the first to
engage. When they tire out, fast twitch muscles take over.

Therefore, the only way to ensure that fast twitch muscle fibers are
actively being used during your workouts is to work to temporary
fatigue. That will ensure that your slow-twitch muscles have been spent
and your fast twitch muscle fibers are fully engaged.

So to answer your question: No, running cross country won't decrease
your explosiveness, nor will it decrease your sprints. But it won't do
anything to *help* either. If you're only using your slow twitch
muscles, you're doing nothing to engage your fast twitch muscles. Over
time, as your fast twitch muscle fibers remain undeveloped, they will
become harder and harder to improve, as your slow twitch muscles will
fatigue less, meaning even less engagement of fast twitch muscle fibers.

So it's best to keep your workouts varied, even if you're running cross
country. If you're running five days a week, at least two of your days
should be track days. You should be doing ladders or intervals or other
similar sprint exercises to work to fatigue to engage those slow twitch
muscles. You can't do distance every day. That won't help you.

*Full disclosure: I was a distance runner. I have the low blood pressure
and the slow twitch muscles which won't grow mass to prove it. And by
the way, you lose fast twitch muscle much faster than slow twitch muscle
as you age, so it becomes incrementally harder as you get older to build
muscle mass.*
