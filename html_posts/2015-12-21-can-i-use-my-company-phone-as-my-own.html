It\'s entirely up to the company you work for.

I have seen government employees being required to print out their
itemized call lists monthly, highlight the personal calls, and then
submit a check at a fixed rate per minute for using the phone for
personal use. Part of that reason was because those phones are paid for
using taxpayer dollars.

Most non-governmental companies, however, understand that there will be
a mix of personal and business use of a mobile phone, and as long as
charges are not excessive, they allow it.

However, each company that provides mobile phones to their employees has
their own policies and procedures; there is no standard across the
industry. Normally, mobile phones are managed by the IT organization, so
check with them or with your HR department to get the current policies
and procedures around your company\'s mobile phones.
