It's nice that I'll be able to save the hundred dollars or so that it
would have cost me to have to get a permit.

But "exciting?" No, not at all.

Oh and by the way, you cannot open-carry in Florida unless you are
hunting or fishing. Other than that, no one open carries in Florida.

The effect will be to save me money. The only people who this affects
are the people who could have legally gotten a permit in the first
place, as they are the only people who are now permitted to carry
without a permit.

If you couldn't get a permit before, you can't conceal under the new
legislation. The only people who do not need a permit to carry are
people who could have previously qualified to get a permit. If you
couldn't get a permit before this legislation, and you carry concealed,
it's still illegal. So that hasn't changed.

It simply moves the onus from the firearms owner to law enforcement. If
you are concealing and you are involved in an encounter with law
enforcement, and if there is a question whether or not you are a person
who is permitted to conceal, now the onus will be on law enforcement to
determine whether or not you are legally permitted to conceal a firearm.

In other words, if you are a person who would otherwise be able to get a
permit, you don't have to get permission *before* you conceal *in order
to* conceal.
