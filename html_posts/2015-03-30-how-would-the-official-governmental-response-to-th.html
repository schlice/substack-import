**Content:** [In theory, since it is a humanitarian mission, the US
would respond to China in the same way it did for Maylasia, and US
foreign policy is not dictated by the foreign or domestic policies of
other countries. We provide humanitarian support and assistance to any
country that requests it. I suspect the Chinese may be disinclined to
acquiesce to our offer of assistance, though. More likely, they
wouldn\'t ask for help, unlike the Malaysians, who
did.]{.rendered_qtext}
