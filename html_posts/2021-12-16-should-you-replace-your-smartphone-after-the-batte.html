The answer is "it depends."

Most modern smartphones have batteries which should last around 2 years
under normal use, which happens to coincide with the average amount of
time smartphone users hang on to any particular handset. So most people
will just trade in or sell their old handsets and get new ones.

You could consider replacing your battery. For Android devices, many
repair shops will sell you a new battery and install it for you, and it
will probably run you about \$100. Apple [[also has a
service](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=934eaf&url=https://support.apple.com/iphone/repair/service/battery-power){.external_link

your battery replaced. If your phone is covered by AppleCare+, battery
replacements are free. If it is not under warranty, a battery
replacement will cost you anywhere from \$49 to \$69.

If you have an Android smartphone, you can potentially flash a new
operating system on to your device when your battery starts to hold less
charge. LineageOS is a good one, and they support many different Android
devices. You can breathe new life into your phone, while getting better
battery life out of a battery which may be headed downhill. Just
remember that **doing so would void any warranty you had** (if you still
had hardware warranty), so don't even consider doing this until after
your hardware warranty expires.
