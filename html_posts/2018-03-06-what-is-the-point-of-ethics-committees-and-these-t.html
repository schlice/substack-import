**What is the point of ethics committees and these types of
investigation when Trump most likely won\'t do anything?**

Trump did do something. He investigated the matter (through his counsel)
and they advised her about the relevant law (the Hatch act). From the
article you quoted:

It appears that in enforcement of the Hatch Act, courts tend to take
"intent" into account. There have been numerous violations of the Act
which have been dismissed as [["errors," or "technical"
violations](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=584b59&url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/09/13/white-house-indicates-sebelius-wont-be-punished-over-hatch-act-violation/){.external_link

unintentional,
violations](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a617e1&url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/07/18/investigation-hud-secretary-julian-castro-broke-law-endorsing-clinton-hatch-act/87263314/){.external_link

It appears that this gaffe by Conway was similarly unintentional, and
the White House Office of Legal Counsel found the same.
