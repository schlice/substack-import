Colorado is an interesting case. They didn't actually "legalize"
marijuana. What they did is to provide an "affirmative defense" to the
Federal charge at a state level. It also specifically enjoined state and
local law enforcement from enforcing any laws against the sale or
possession of marijuana. That means that no state or local cop will bust
anyone for possession of marijuana, because the state Constitution has
provided an affirmative defense for possession. They are allowed to
create laws surrounding appropriate use of marijuana, which they have
done.

This has no bearing whatsoever on the Federal charge of violations of
the Controlled Substances Act. It simply says that the state will not
charge you with violations of the CSA.

This means that the DEA could waltz in at any time and charge anyone
buying or selling marijuana with violations of Federal law. And that
would be perfectly legal. The change to the Colorado Constitution would
not apply, since the charge is a violation of the Controlled Substances
Act, not a violation of state law.

That also means that there is no legal case the Feds can pursue against
Colorado. In fact, it's already been decided by the Supreme Court that
the Federal government cannot force states to enforce Federal law.
Remember Arizona v. United States? Arizona wanted to enforce Federal
immigration law, and SCOTUS ruled that they could not. Only the Federal
government can enforce Federal law, and states are barred from doing so.
The Federal government, conversely, cannot force states to enforce state
law, either. All they are allowed to do is to claim that a state law
allows direct violation of a Federal law, which is not what the Colorado
constitutional change does.
