**Is there any tragedy or act of violence or other circumstance that
will result in gun advocates supporting an assault rifles only ban?**

YES! Of course there is!

***When you can show that the tragedy, act of violence, or other
circumstance is the fault OF THE GUN, gun advocates will support banning
the gun.***

Until then, gun advocates are going to focus their efforts on the most
likely source of the problem: **the gun operator**.

Currently, the gun is as responsible for crime as the fork is
responsible for making people fat. To end the obesity epidemic, you have
heard no one call for the banning of forks, but a fork has been present
at every single instance of obesity. In fact, it was the fork in the
person's hand which moved the food into the mouth. If we ban the fork,
perhaps the obese won't eat anymore.
