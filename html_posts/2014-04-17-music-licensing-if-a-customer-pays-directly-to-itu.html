<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Under US copyright law, this is a technically illegal<br>action, since you are only granted a right to *use* the media (i.e.<br>listen to it), not *distribute* it. It\'s not considered Fair Use,<br>because you are not using it for *your* purposes, you are providing it<br>to *someone else.* This violates Fair Use, which states that your<br>license for that copy of the song allows you to do with it what you want<br>for *your own* use (i.e. put it on an iPad, a music player, an SD card<br>for a cell phone, a CD, have an archive copy, etc)\<br>\<br>Now practically speaking, you\'re not very likely to get caught. To<br>record a song from iTunes to a digital greeting card, you would be doing<br>so \"over the air\" basically recording what you hear from your speakers<br>using the card\'s little microphone. So it\'s not a digital copy of the<br>song by any means; it\'s a crackly little greeting card manual<br>recording. While this technically is a copyright infraction, it is so<br>infinitesimally small that you likely wouldn\'t be caught, or even<br>pursued. Unless you did this on a large scale (i.e. produced thousands<br>of these cards and sold them), I don\'t think it would even raise an<br>eyebrow.\<br>\<br>*NOTE: I\'m not telling you to violate copyright law. The correct way to<br>gift a song to someone is to go into iTunes, locate the song, click the<br>arrow on the right side of the Buy button, and select \"Gift this<br>song\", then pay for the gift. Then the friend has the right to use that<br>gifted copy of the song, and it\'s perfectly legal. So you could buy the<br>gift, save the money on the recordable audio greeting card and get a<br>regular greeting card, and include the printout of the gift code inside<br>the card. You\'re still giving your friend a song, but you\'re doing it<br>legally and they get a better quality song to listen to. You can get a<br>regular greeting card for \$.99, and the song in iTunes for roughly<br>\$.99, where a recordable greeting card is more like \$4.99. So you\'re<br>actually saving money doing it the legal way.*]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
