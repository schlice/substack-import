**Content:** [Under US copyright law, this is a technically illegal
action, since you are only granted a right to *use* the media (i.e.
listen to it), not *distribute* it. It\'s not considered Fair Use,
because you are not using it for *your* purposes, you are providing it
to *someone else.* This violates Fair Use, which states that your
license for that copy of the song allows you to do with it what you want
for *your own* use (i.e. put it on an iPad, a music player, an SD card
for a cell phone, a CD, have an archive copy, etc)\
\
Now practically speaking, you\'re not very likely to get caught. To
record a song from iTunes to a digital greeting card, you would be doing
so \"over the air\" basically recording what you hear from your speakers
using the card\'s little microphone. So it\'s not a digital copy of the
song by any means; it\'s a crackly little greeting card manual
recording. While this technically is a copyright infraction, it is so
infinitesimally small that you likely wouldn\'t be caught, or even
pursued. Unless you did this on a large scale (i.e. produced thousands
of these cards and sold them), I don\'t think it would even raise an
eyebrow.\
\
*NOTE: I\'m not telling you to violate copyright law. The correct way to
gift a song to someone is to go into iTunes, locate the song, click the
arrow on the right side of the Buy button, and select \"Gift this
song\", then pay for the gift. Then the friend has the right to use that
gifted copy of the song, and it\'s perfectly legal. So you could buy the
gift, save the money on the recordable audio greeting card and get a
regular greeting card, and include the printout of the gift code inside
the card. You\'re still giving your friend a song, but you\'re doing it
legally and they get a better quality song to listen to. You can get a
regular greeting card for \$.99, and the song in iTunes for roughly
\$.99, where a recordable greeting card is more like \$4.99. So you\'re
actually saving money doing it the legal way.*]{.rendered_qtext}
