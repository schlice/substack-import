Have you ever used a credit card? You make a purchase today with the
promise of paying off that debt in the future.

Before Christ died to repay our sins, Jews burnt offerings to God, and
on the Day of Atonement, we placed our hands on a lamb and transferred
our sins into that lamb, which was sacrificed to "atone" for our sins.
These burnt offerings and sacrificing of lambs were like putting a
charge on a credit card. It's forgiveness now, while we wait for that
debt to be paid. Those actions were not sufficient for all time; they
had to repeat the process every year. That atonement was not lasting,
because the debt for our sin had not yet been fully paid.

Once Christ died on the cross, taking on our sin as He did so, our sin
debt was fully and completely paid. And in order to take the sins of the
world, and in order to take all sin debt (past, present, and future), He
had to be God. Only God could take on Himself all of our sins, for all
time. Only God can forgive sin, because of His great mercy. But that sin
debt must still be *paid*, because of His justice. So only God could
take onto Himself all of our sins at the time He was crucified.

Including all of the pending charges which were waiting for that moment.

Interestingly, it was at that moment when *God the Father turned away
from God the Son*. At that moment, Jesus called out to God, saying, "My
God, my God, why have you forsaken Me?" God had "forsaken" Jesus,
because Jesus bore the world's sin, and God cannot abide sin. Abiding
sin violates His perfect nature.
