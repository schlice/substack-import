**Now that the DPRK has a missile that is (at least) theoretically
capable of carrying a nuclear weapon to any point in the United States
of America, what is the likelihood of it \'claiming victory and going
home\'?**

Somewhere between slim and none.

Their goal was to develop a viable nuclear weapon so they can "sit at
the grown up table" with the other nuclear nations and "be taken
seriously" in international discussions.

But as you all know, it takes more than a big stick to be respected, in
the words of Teddy Roosevelt. You also have to "speak softly," something
which the Kims have never done. There is a place for diplomacy, and the
Kims don't understand that the threat of nuclear violence only works if
you are backing up a globally accepted standard of conduct. Screaming at
the top of your lungs, "YOU MUST NOW RESPECT ME BECAUSE I HAVE A NUKE!"
doesn't garner you any more respect than when you didn't have a nuke in
the first place.

We always watched DPRK closely. Now we have to watch them twice as
closely, and anything that even smells like a threat against another
nation will have to be dealt with swiftly, because the ramifications are
now so much greater.

IF ONLY the DPRK could stop committing atrocities against its own people
and come to the bargaining table as an equal ally on the world stage,
things might be different. Is that likely to happen now, simply because
they now possess the technologies which collectively can create a
nuclear device?

I highly doubt it.
