**Do you think there will be lawsuits on the basis of constitutionality
if President Trump\'s \"Food Box\" program is made into law?**

No, there would not be a Constitutional challenge if they decide to
float a proposal to cut SNAP funding (not eliminate, but cut) and
replace some of it with "food boxes." So far as I can tell, there is no
Constitutional requirement to have a SNAP program at all, so changing it
to give less money for food and instead actually give food should not
cause a Constitutional issue.

I'm sure the 9th Circus can find some Constitutional argument for trying
to block Executive action (again). Maybe food boxes somehow violate the
3rd Amendment or something. Because food boxes is just like quartering
soldiers...or something. Who knows. If there is a wacky equivalence to
be found, you can bet on the 9th being the stalwarts to find it. Meh.

There are many concerns with the actual proposal (not the
Constitutionality of it) of course, such as people with dietary
restrictions, and people who are homeless and can't receive a box. It is
those concerns that would probably render such a program a non-starter.
They should instead revamp the SNAP program and be MUCH more strict on
where SNAP funds can be used, and on what products SNAP funds can be
spent. You would think that the *actual name of the program*, the
Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program would render it
self-limiting, but I guess they thought that it was somehow
discriminatory to try to tell people on what they could spend
nutritional assistance dollars. I personally find it fascinating how
much money from SNAP gets spent in the Port of Miami. They must have a
special 3-night SNAP Cruise that I'm unaware of.

But Constitutionally? It should not be a problem.
