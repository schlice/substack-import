**Content:** [You can claim whatever you want at whatever time you want.
The question is, does your case have any legs? Is there any merit to
what you\'re asking?\
\
And to determine that, you first have to show some harm.\
\
If there is some demonstrable harm caused by the adopted person learning
the identity of his/her biological parents, and it was a fact that was
supposed to remain private, you may have a case for pain and suffering.\
\
I think a better tack may be to look at privacy laws surrounding
adoptions. Revelation of birth parents is tightly controlled, and is
only ever allowed if both parties separately agree through a neutral
third party (usually the adoption agency). So there may be some breach
of privacy laws you may be able to use. The damages for pain and
suffering can be tacked on to the privacy case, and you won\'t have to
show harm for cause at that point.\
\
I would have the adopted person consult with an attorney in his/her
local area to find out whether or not there is a case to
pursue.]{.rendered_qtext}
