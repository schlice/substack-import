This reminds me of a story.

Two hunters were walking through African hunting lands when they
stumbled on a den of lions. As the females slowly stretched standing up,
eyeing their next meal, one hunter casually knelt down and untied his
shoes, taking a pair of running shoes out of his backpack.

His companion was incredulous. "What are you doing??? You can't outrun a
*lion!*"

The first hunter replied, "I don't have to outrun a lion. I only have to
outrun *you.*"

You don't have to make your home a fortress to stop a burglar. You just
have to make your home *less of a desirable target than your neighbor's
homes.* And what makes a home desirable for a burglar? Darkness and
concealment.

To do that, employ a "defense in depth" strategy. To wit:

1.  **Keep your exterior lights on all night.** Seems like a bit of a
    waste until you realize that LED lights are *extremely* energy
    efficient. You can run all of them from dusk till dawn for less than
    the cost of running a single 40-watt incandescent bulb. You can get
    a "dusk to dawn" timer which replaces your switch for your outdoor
    lights for less than \$20.
2.  **Remove camouflage from around your windows.** Trim back shrubs, or
    plant thorny rose bushes beneath windows, so that the windows remain
    exposed.
3.  **Get a dog**. Or if you're not a dog person, you can get some very
    realistic-sounding dog bark simulator devices on Amazon which listen
    for noise and then start a dog bark sound. Burglars are not
    interested in messing with a dog in a well-lit house where they have
    to work out in the open.

**TL;DR:** The best way to stop burglars from robbing your home is to
make your house less desirable to burglars than your neighbor's house.
