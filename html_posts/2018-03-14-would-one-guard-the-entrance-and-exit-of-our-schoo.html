**Would one guard the entrance and exit of our schools to help solve the
issue of gun violence? There are plenty of government buildings and
airports that do this with success.**

That's a good start, but it's not enough.

Simply placing a guard at the door is no better than placing a topiary
at the door, or a lovely piece of art. That guard has to be able to do
something more than just stand there and look pretty.

That guard should be one part of a *comprehensive security plan* that
locks down or eliminates any other point of entry into the school and
establishes "defense-in-depth," as well as security training for
everyone, regular security lockdown drills, and training with local
police to understand how to respond to active shooter scenarios.

We have an *obligation* to protect our students. Those who screech that
"schools will become prisons" are simply deflecting. Are airports
"prisons?" Yet we secure airports better than schools. How was the TSA
able to do this but the Department of Education is not? You think those
guys could get together and discuss...
