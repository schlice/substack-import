**Time and obstinance.**

Any problem faced by a Homeowner's Association can be solved given
enough time and a homeowner who is willing to work with the HOA. No fine
should ever turn into a lien and a subsequent foreclosure if those two
things are present.

HOAs foreclose on homeowners when too much time has passed, and the
homeowner is not being reasonable.

Dues, late fees, and fines can accumulate if left unattended. Once those
amounts reach a certain threshold (it's \$1000 in the state of Florida),
the account can be transferred to the HOA's attorney to begin lien
proceedings. We have found that obstinate homeowners loosen up their
obstinance when they learn that their house is getting a lien recorded
against it.

But if they still steadfastly refuse to pay and refuse to even negotiate
in good faith, and enough **time** has passed, the attorney (with the
consent of the Board) can foreclose on that lien to collect the money
they are due (plus attorney's fees), which by the way was still
accumulating during all of that time of obstinance.

If receiving notice of a lien being filed against your property isn't
enough to wake you up, then perhaps receiving a notice that a lienholder
is moving to foreclose on that lien is. And from my experience, it
usually is. Homeowners suddenly get really communicative when they get a
letter from a lawyer saying that their lien is going to be foreclosed.

But it should never come to that. It only goes that far when homeowners
won't communicate with the HOA (and eventually with the HOA's attorney).
