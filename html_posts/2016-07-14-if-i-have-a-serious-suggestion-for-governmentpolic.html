You have several options. You can go directly to the department with
your suggestion. Usually the department website has contact information
that you can use. Make sure you request a reply with the status of your
suggestion.

Failing that, you can go to your city council with your suggestion. They
essentially control policy at the department.

You can also always go to the media with your idea. If local news
outlets get hold of it, they might publicize it.
