**Based on Michael Cohen\'s plea in federal court, could the Trump
Organization, including the president, be prosecuted under the RICO Act?
The Trump University case was a civil RICO class action, settled before
trial.**

Not at all.

First, you would have to be clear that the request by Trump for Cohen to
pay off Daniels was a campaign finance violation.

**It is not at all 100% clear that the payment is a violation of
campaign finance law**.

In a nutshell, campaign finance law says that in order for it to be a
violation, it must be a fully political payment. Basically, you have to
prove that Trump would not have made the payment if he was not a
candidate.

In this case, Trump can easily show that he would have made the payment
had he not been a candidate. His record of payoffs of other women with
whom he's had affairs, before he was a candidate, means that his payment
could have had a personal, as well as a political, motivation. Indeed,
he doesn't even have to deny that he had a political motivation. He
could have had multiple motivations. In order for it to be a campaign
finance law violation, however, it must not have had any other
motivation behind it.

And that alone means that the payment is not covered under campaign
finance rules, and is therefore not a Federal crime.

It's not a campaign finance violation, which means it's not a violation
of Federal law, which means that RICO also does not apply.
