**Can doctors run red lights and break other traffic laws if they need
to get to the hospital due to a emergency?**

There is no provision in any state traffic laws that I'm aware of that
allow doctors to violate traffic laws in the case of emergency. It would
be a mitigating circumstance in a defense of such a ticket, but it's not
codified in law.

That said, some states do have provisions for emergency medial
responders to have colored flashing lights in their cars designating
them as such. These, however, are generally reserved for volunteer
ambulance crews in places where volunteer ambulance crews exist. In law,
these lights are not supposed to be used to evade traffic laws, but so
other drivers could provide courtesy to these drivers (i.e. moving
over). In practice, they do use them to kinda bend traffic laws a
little.
