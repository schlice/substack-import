**Why was Cheyenne mountain picked for NORAD as opposed to any other
place nearby or different location?**

This is an excellent question, thanks for asking.

Cheyenne Mountain was picked for several reasons, but the most central
were the following:

1.  Colorado Springs is home to several major military installations
    (Peterson AFB, Fort Carson) and can provide logistical support to
    the Mountain fairly easily
2.  Cheyenne Mountain is *geologically stable*. The facility is built
    into a mountain made of *solid granite*. It is not on any fault
    lines, and it is in an area of stable geological activity.
