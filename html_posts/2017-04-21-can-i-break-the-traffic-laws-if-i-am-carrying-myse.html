You can break the traffic laws at any time regardless of how many people
are in your car or what their medical conditions are.

The questions are:

- Should you break the traffic law to transport a sick/injured person to
  the hospital?
- Is it *legal* to break the traffic law when someone is sick/injured so
  you can get to the emergency room?

Should you break the traffic law to transport a sick/injured person to
the hospital? The short answer is **no**. You are far better off waiting
for an ambulance to arrive. The ambulance can get to you faster than you
can get to the hospital. Under normal circumstances, the ambulance is
not at the hospital, so it's not like it would take the same amount of
time for them to get to you as for you to get to the hospital. Plus,
they are equipped with lights and sirens, so they can safely and legally
break traffic laws to get to you. Finally, they have advanced life
support equipment on board the ambulance, so once they get to you, they
can start helping to stabilize the patient immediately, while you're in
transit.

As you may have gathered, it is most certainly not legal to break the
traffic laws at any time. Your transporting of a sick person would be a
defense to the charges you would be facing if you did this, and there is
no guarantee that you would be relieved of responsibility when you have
your day in court. Clearly, it is much safer and better for your patient
to wait for the ambulance than to try to get there yourself.
