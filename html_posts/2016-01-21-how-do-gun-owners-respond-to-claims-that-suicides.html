It\'s a spurious argument. It\'s like saying that households which have
computers with DVD-RW drives will illegally copy movies more than houses
that don\'t.

Guns don\'t make suicide ***possible***. They certainly make suicide
***easier***, as the sole purpose of a gun is to kill, and it does so
very effectively and efficiently. But the fact that a gun makes suicide
easier isn\'t an argument to get rid of the gun. It\'s an argument to
get rid of suicide.

However, I will say this: I think technology has come far enough that we
can have fast access to our firearms in advanced gun safes while still
keeping them out of the hands of those who would do stupid things with
them (i.e. commit crimes or kill themselves). I think we should start
looking more closely at \"safe storage\" and what we can do to increase
the number of people who regularly use gun safes. As I said, safe
technology has come a long way, baby (sorry, I\'m reminded of that
infamous Newport ad every time I say \"come a long way.\" I\'m a child
of the 80s, I can\'t help it). Anyway, safe technology has advanced to
the point where we can get quick access to our firearms and still keep
them out of the hands of those in which they do not belong.

If the government wants to invest money in something, don\'t bother with
a national gun registry (which accomplishes nothing; you can still
commit suicide with a registered gun just as easily as you can with an
unregistered gun), don\'t bother with a buyback (heh, they don\'t have
enough money to by back 1/10th of the guns in circulation), how about
federal subsidies to buy advanced gun safes? How about grants to gun
safe manufacturers to drive the costs down? How about grants to improve
the technology behind a gun safe? The technology isn\'t in the box,
it\'s in the method by which we determine who is authorized to open the
box. We have to be accurate, and we have to be fast. I should be able to
reach my hand towards the handle of the gun safe and it should recognize
me and unlock before I even touch the safe. That would be cool. We

always hesitate to post such links, because I\'ll get a slew of people
telling me why that particular safe is bad, or that particular
technology is bad, or why I shouldn\'t be required to lock my gun up,
ever.

Safe storage in a technologically-advanced gun safe is a
***compromise***. Gun owners won\'t like it because they\'ll actually
have to lock up their guns. Gun control advocates won\'t like it because
we\'re not reducing the number of guns in circulation, or limiting
magazine size, or getting rid of scary-looking \"assault weapons.\"

But safe storage might prevent someone from committing suicide with a
gun. It probably won\'t prevent the committed suicidal person from
actually committing suicide. But it will prevent them from doing it
***with a gun*** which is apparently important to anti-gunners.
