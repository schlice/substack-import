**What should you do assuming you leave your car unlocked overnight and
you discover a handgun in your car? It could be a crime weapon. Will
police suspect you if you notify them?**

Same advice that Eddie Eagle (the NRA Mascot) gives to kids about gun
safety:

- Stop
- Don't touch
- Leave the area
- Tell an adult (or in this case, the police)

Of course they will suspect you, silly! It's your car! They wouldn't be
doing their *job* if they didn't suspect you! But if you followed the
rules above, and consented to all of their background investigating,
they will find that your fingerprints are nowhere near that gun. They
will be all over the car, but not on the gun. How is it possible that
it's your gun but you never touched it? It's possible, but unlikely.
It's also possible but unlikely that you actually committed a crime with
the gun and then decided to call the police and tell them that it's not
your gun. Or you could have thrown the gun in the river, but hey,
calling the police is easier and there's less chance of going to jail,
right? /s

Anyway, get out of the car, lock it so no one can get in, go back in the
house, and call the police. Do everything they tell you to do. Let them
search everywhere they want. If you are arrested, don't help them any
more and get a lawyer, but until then, tell them everything they want to
know, including what you had for dinner last night and why you left your
car unlocked.
