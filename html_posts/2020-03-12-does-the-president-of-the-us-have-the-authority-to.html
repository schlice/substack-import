**Does the president of the US have the authority to issue a travel
ban?**

Absolutely. Federal law provides this power solely to the President. The
law says that the he can restrict immigration into the country
\"whenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens or of any
class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the
interests of the United States.\" He's used this same authority when he
restricted travel from countries which were state sponsors or major
suppliers of terrorism.

States have this authority as well.

Additionally, the CDC can implement quarantines and health emergencies
as the need arises.
