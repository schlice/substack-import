According to the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, the law applies
equally to everyone. No one is exempt from the law. So to answer the
question, yes, every thief should be prosecuted.

When it comes to the ***punishment*** for that crime, we might consider
a different form of punishment, because perhaps a poor person has a
different reason for theft, and some punishments clearly won't work.
Perhaps we might consider mandatory education classes instead of jail
time.

Fines clearly won't work , because you need money to pay a fine. Fining
the poor is as smart as "debtor's prison" was in England.
