Have you ever seen a movie or a TV show, and right at the very
beginning, it says something like, "Inspired By True Events." What does
that mean? Does that mean that the story is *exactly what happened*? No,
the notice at the beginning tells you that the story is its own, but the
*inspiration* for the story, the idea for the story, comes from
real-life events. The purpose of the notice is to let you know that
while it may resemble the true story, it is only a story "like" the
original story.

It's the same with the Bible.

God is not the author of the Bible. God is the *inspiration* behind the
Bible. God inspired the writers to write (in their own words) the
message that He wanted to send. Just like the movie or TV show that was
inspired by true events, the Bible is not the actual word of God (unless
there are direct quotes). The Bible is *inspired by God*, or more
specifically, inspired by the Holy Spirit.

The word "inspire" means "to breathe life into." God *breathes life*
into the words of the author.
