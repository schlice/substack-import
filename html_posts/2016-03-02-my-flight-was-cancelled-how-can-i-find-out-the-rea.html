Short answer: you can\'t. You can ask. They don\'t have to tell you.
They do have to tell you whether or not the cancellation was because of
a reason within the airline\'s control (so that you know if you qualify
for Rule 240), but that\'s all they are required to tell you.

Longer answer: the airline ticket you bought is a ***contract for
carriage***. It doesn\'t specify which flight you must take. It doesn\'t
even specify **when** you need to arrive. The airline will make every
effort to get you there when they originally agreed to, but they are
under no obligation to take you on any specific plane, on any specific
seat, or at any specific time. That said, they are under no obligation
to tell you why the flight was cancelled. They can cancel it for any
reason.

However, if they do cancel it because of a foreseeable preventable
reason within the control of the airline (i.e. crew scheduling mixup,
mechanical failure, etc), not because of acts of God, weather delays,
etc., under **Rule 240**, they can transfer your ticket to another
airline if the original airline cannot get you where they said they were
going to get you in a reasonable amount of time.
