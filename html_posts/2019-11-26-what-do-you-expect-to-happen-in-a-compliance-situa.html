**What do you expect to happen in a compliance situation where anyone
who self-reports a violation is severely punished, more severely than
those caught covering-up?**

I expect that the behavior which is more harshly punished will be less
likely to be voluntarily used than the one that is less harshly
punished.

The idea is to punish less harshly the behavior you want people to do,
and punish more harshly the behavior you don't want them to do. This
appears to be the opposite.

Ideally, you should want to punish someone less severely when they
self-report. You should want to punish someone far more severely when
they are caught covering up their misdeed. Guiding people towards the
desired result using severity of punishment is ideal.

In this scenario, self-reporting is punished more harshly than getting
caught. So people will be much less likely to self-report; they'll just
wait and see if they get caught, and it won't be too big a deal in that
case. There's less incentive to self-report in this scenario, which is
somewhat backwards.
