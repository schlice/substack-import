**Fundamentally, isn\'t the desire to be the president in the first
place a prima facie indicator that someone isn\'t quite right in the
head?**

Yeah, you're right. All those assays in elementary school should be
carefully screened by a psychiatrist, and anyone who answers that they
want to be the President should be shipped off to a psych ward.

And cops, too. Those racist bastards should all be taken out back and
shot, right? Who needs them? Who needs Presidents? They're all mentally
insane, right?
