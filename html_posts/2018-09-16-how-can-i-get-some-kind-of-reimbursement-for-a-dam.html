**How can I get some kind of reimbursement for a damaged iPhone?**

- Warranty
- Insurance
- Small claims court.

If it's less than one year old and you can prove that it was "damaged"
from the factory, then you can take it back to the store and have it
replaced under warranty.

If not, then it's on your insurance carrier to reimburse you for a
damaged phone.

If someone negligently damaged your phone, you can sue them in small
claims court for the cost of the device. You have to show how they were
negligent in handling your device.
