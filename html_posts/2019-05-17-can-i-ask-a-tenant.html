**Can I ask a tenant's association to reimburse property damage by
rain?**

Under normal circumstances, you shouldn't have to.

The condo should have insurance that covers common areas, and you should
have an individual insurance policy that covers everything inside your
unit, such as walls, floors, and contents.

First thing to do is to conclusively determine where the water came
from. If the water came from a common area (like the roof on top of the
condo), file a claim with the insurer of the master building policy. If
you have a unit over top of you, it gets more tricky. If the tenant
above you caused the damage which led to the water incursion, neither
insurance (your personal insurance or the building insurer) may cover
it, and you'll have to resort to litigation.

But in all cases, address the water first. Make sure you fix the damage
in your unit. Unaddressed water can lead to toxic mold growing, and no
one wants that. Fix the problem first, then chase down who is going to
pay.
