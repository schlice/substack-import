So you have two questions here: why is the Constitution included in the
*God Bless The USA Bible*, and why does the link to the Constitution not
appear on the Trump White House website?

\

Here's the answer to the first question: ***Why do you think Trump has
the Constitution included in his \"God Bless the USA Bible"?***

Let me just start by saying, as a Christian, I take issue with the "God
Bless the USA Bible," also known as the "Trump Bible."

The Bible wasn't commissioned or written by President Trump, and he
didn't have any editorial control over what was placed into it. It was
only *endorsed* by President Trump. It was also endorsed by
singer/songwriter Lee Greenwood (who wrote the song "God Bless The
USA"). But neither of them decided what was to go into it. For brevity's
sake (and because I'm lazy and don't want to type out its proper name
every time) we'll just call it "The Trump Bible."

The Trump Bible is a leather-bound Bible with an embossed American flag
on the front, and it contains the King James Version of the Bible, along
with the Founding Documents (the Declaration of Independence, the
Constitution, the Pledge of Allegiance) and the lyrics to the song "God
Bless The USA" in Lee Greenwood's own handwriting. It was supposed to
contain the New International Version of the Bible, but Zondervan (the
publisher of the NIV) withdrew their version of the Bible after public
criticism. Instead, the KJV was included because it is already part of
the Public Domain and is not under copyright restrictions.

I take issue with the Bible being lumped together with our nation's
founding documents. Doing so tends to equate (at some level) our
founding documents with the Bible. While our nation was indeed founded
on a Judeo-Christian heritage, that does not put our founding documents
on par with the Bible. They are certainly great documents, *but they
don't hold a candle to the Bible.* Putting them together in a single
book tends to both improperly elevate our founding documents, and water
down the Bible. The Bible should stand *alone* as the inspired Word of
God, as the founding documents, while pretty great in their own right,
are not the inspired word of God.

\

Second question: ***\[Why was\] the Constitution removed from the White
House web page on \[Trump's\] first day in office?***

So first mistake: the Biden White House website did not have a copy of
the entire Constitution on it. It had [[a page
describing](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a2b36a&url=https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/about-the-white-house/our-government/the-constitution/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="archives.gov"}]{.qlink_container} the Constitution, and
then[ [a
link](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=22ee61&url=https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);" qt-tooltip="archives.gov"}
]{.qlink_container}over to the National Archives which has more
information (and photos and history and the actual text) about the
Constitution.

Second mistake: The Trump White House team did not intentionally remove
references to the Constitution from the website. **The new
Administration builds a completely new website from scratch, and the old
administration's version of the White House website is** ***archived*.**
Those archives stay online, and
[[you](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=65c09c&url=https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);" qt-tooltip="archives.gov"}
]{.qlink_container}can
[[go](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6d8588&url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/){.external_link

]{.qlink_container}visit
[[them](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6ef8ae&url=https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/){.external_link

]{.qlink_container}any time.

Trump White House Website 2.0 is still under construction, and is very
thin currently. It is constantly being updated. Currently it only has
very pertinent information about the early days of the Trump 2.0
administration, and a lot of the historical information (like
information about our government) is still under construction.

Lack of a link to the Constitution does not mean the administration does
not care about the Constitution, or doesn't retain any fidelity to it.
It simply means the site is still under construction, and we are still
very early in the new administration.
