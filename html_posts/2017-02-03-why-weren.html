There were very few school shootings before 1980. Actually, there were
very few school shootings before 1999. It just wasn't a problem.

So what's changed?

Have guns suddenly become "more accessible?" No, we've had roughly the
same access to guns then as we do now.

Have schools become less secure? Hardly. Schools used to be open
campuses. They're now tightly-controlled mini-fortresses.

So again, what's changed?

***People have changed. Society has changed.***

It's not the guns. It's not the schools. The only thing left is the
people, and the society in which the people live.

The way the nation has treated mental illness changed dramatically
starting with a program called
[[**deinstitutionalization**](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e44a9c&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinstitutionalisation){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}. The process started in
the 60s, moving away from mental hospitals and moving more towards
community mental health clinics and heavier reliance on medications.
While this trend has been good for some, it has left others with nowhere
to go and no treatment options. It also changed the laws surrounding
when someone can be hospitalized for mental issues, setting the bar much
higher for judges and law enforcement to intervene and recommend a
person be examined. This has led to far more people refusing care
(mostly blinded by their mental issues) and more mentally challenged
individuals walking free but untreated.

While some may see this as a good thing (those darned mental hospitals
were torture chambers), it set in motion a series of events that left
many people who desperately needed mental care with nowhere to go and no
one who could force them to go. It basically takes a mentally challenged
person to commit a crime before mental treatment can be mandated in many
cases. Fixing our nation's very broken mental health system is going to
be a massive undertaking, but if we want to stop the shooters, we have
to help them get better before they break. Our current mental health
system won't do that any time soon.

Improvements in technology and advances in the Internet brought many
together, but isolated some as well. It has only gotten worse as people
have become more connected and more networked all the time. It was bad
enough in 1999, but it's even worse now. The technology itself is not to
blame. The technology is not responsible for isolating those who are
usually considered to be on the "outskirts" of the social order. But the
technology has indeed magnified and further isolated those people.
Additionally, the same technology allows those "outsiders" to network
with other outsiders in an echo chamber of sorts, where their radical
ideas for revenge against those who have "wronged" them can be fomented.

Let's be clear. Shooters pick schools for several reasons: they have
"perceived injustices" and the chief perpetrators of these injustices
are usually found in schools. Schools are also what we tactically call
"soft targets." They are target-rich environments with little to no
security (and the security measures they do have are easily defeated by
someone with a little bit of time and effort). If we're honest, we see
mass shooters picking largely soft targets (schools, malls, movie
theaters, etc). You don't ever see mass shooters target a police
station, or a gun range. Those would be considered "hard targets," as
they would meet active resistance. Even so, most shooters know that they
are going in and probably not coming out. So they pick soft targets so
that they get the most "bang for the buck," so to speak. They can take
out as many targets as possible before they go down. Soft targets are
the best places to do just that.
