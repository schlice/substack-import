Apparently, having sex in open houses, or "house humping" as it is
colloquially known, is a big thing.

But in terms of "responsibility," the realtor is ultimately responsible
for anything that happens during the open house. How you move forward is
between you and the agent, after you confront them.

If the agent knew it was going on (or worse, participated in it), then
it's probably time to get a new agent, and to file a complaint with the
agency in your area which regulates real estate agents.

If the agent did not know, then you should probably figure out how this
happened, and take steps to ensure that something like this will not
happen again. Perhaps the use (and advertisement) of video cameras in
use may deter these covert sex junkies from striking again.

Make sure you set solid ground rules with your agent, and make sure they
fully understand that they must monitor the people attending, and their
activities. There are some steps you can take: ensure that visitors sign
in and that IDs are checked. Ensure that the agent has enough assistance
that groups of visitors can be monitored throughout the house.
