> Why do some people think religious texts are outdated?

Because they're listening to atheists who fill their heads with things
like "The Bible was written by men" and "The Bible is so old, it doesn't
apply to us today."

What an utter waste of a sentiment.

Are they saying that history is useless? Is history "outdated?" I say
that just because something is *old* doesn't mean that it isn't
*authoritative*.

We know that the Bible is reliable, and we can show that it is true
beyond a reasonable doubt. And since God has not provided any new
revisions of the Bible, I think it's safe to say that it still applies
to us today.

> Do they think God's expectations of us have changed since the books
> were written?

I don't know what they're thinking. We actually have proof of the
Bible's authenticity and trustworthiness, as opposed to...what? What do
they have that proves that God's expectations have changed? What do they
have that shows anything of use?

> Why would God change his mind on what is right and wrong?

He would not. God is timeless and changeless. He cannot "change His
mind," as that would indicate that God is bound by time. There would
have to be a time **before** when God thought something, and then a time
**after** when God thought something else, and this is impossible for
God.

So if God is timeless and changeless, why would anyone think that the
word of God is somehow subject to change?

TL;DR: The words and the teachings of the Bible are as timeless and
changeless as God is. Just because *society* changes does not imply that
the Bible should change with it.
