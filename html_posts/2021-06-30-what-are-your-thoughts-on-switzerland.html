Switzerland should do what's best for Switzerland.

And in Switzerland's case, they want to show their faces.

"In Switzerland, our tradition is that you show your face. That is a
sign of our basic freedoms," Walter Wobmann, chairman of the referendum
committee and a member of parliament for the Swiss People's Party, had
said before the vote.

Additionally, in Switzerland, almost no one wears a burqa and only
around 30 women wear the niqab, the University of Lucerne estimates.
Muslims make up 5% of the Swiss population of 8.6 million people. Think
about that: 30 women out of a country of 8.6 million people. And almost
no one wears a burqa.

At least in Switzerland, this appears to be very much a non-issue.

What are your thoughts on Switzerland's vote to ban most full-face
coverings in public places?
