Well, it explained my symptoms. And it explained a few other things too,
that were unexplained from at least a year or more earlier.

Beyond that, I was numb for a while. I got my first MRI and got a call
back from the doctor the same day (FYI, that's never a good sign to
begin with). He said you need to find a good neurologist, because your
MRI shows all the signs of someone with MS.

I was numb all the way through that first appointment. I remember going
home with stacks of swag and literature from all of the drug
manufacturers and thinking to myself, "If they can afford this much swag
for someone *who hasn't even started on their drug yet,* they're really
fighting for my dollars because these drugs probably all do the same
thing, but with different levels of effectiveness." That much was true.
What was also true was the route of administration, as well as the side
effects, were all different. MS medicines have lots of side effects. And
the ones with the least amount of side effects have to be taken most
frequently.

I started on Copaxone within six months of my diagnosis. At that time,
the Copaxone formulation was a daily injection. It was easy enough to
add to my routine, but the inconvenience of needles was a bit much.
Traveling with my medicine was a challenge too, and I was on a fairly
full-scale travel schedule at that time.

Once I got through the numb phase, I experienced all of the other
emotions that anyone who has experienced a loss experiences: grief,
fear, anger, compromise, and eventual acceptance. It probably took me
about four months to go through the full range of emotions and come out
on the other side.

A few things that helped me: I know that MS is not fatal. It can produce
side effects which can be life threatening, but the disease itself
cannot kill you. And I have always held to the belief that *that which
does not kill me only makes me stronger*. So MS must, therefore, make me
stronger. It certainly doesn't make me physically stronger, but it did
make me mentally tougher. I experience things that my non-MS friends and
family will never experience, and I'm still standing and still fighting.
I also know that everyone has *something* that they have to deal with.
You can't always see those things that others deal with, but there is
always something.

I also learned that I have been given this disease for a reason. I still
don't know what that reason is, but I'm doing what I can, in forums like
this one and others, to help people who have been diagnosed, know what
to expect and to be able to work through it. And that's something.
