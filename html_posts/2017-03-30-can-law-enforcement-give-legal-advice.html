You're asking about whether or not a police officer can give you "legal
advice," meaning advice you can use in a court of law.

**The short answer is only lawyers licensed in the jurisdiction in
question can give legally-binding advice, and they will only do so if
you are in an attorney-client relationship with them.**

But you're not going to get a legal consultation every time you have
simple questions of law, right? Of course not. So the question becomes:
*do you need "legal advice" for every possible legal question?*

Let's take the police out and substitute Quora instead, to illustrate
the answer. If you were to ask Quora about those laws, there would
probably be a tag at the bottom of the answer that says that the answer
is "informational," not "legal advice." Answers do not constitute the
formation of an attorney-client relationship, nor are the answers
solicitation to form such a relationship. They are informational only.

And ideally, all you need is "information," not "legal advice."

The information you get from state or local police officers, as far as
whether or not they are legally binding, would be exactly the same. The
information you get from them is "informational." If you act on that
information, and it is legally incorrect, you could face charges. Of
course, you'd have a pretty rock-solid defense when you quote your
conversation with a police officer who gave you the advice. But if it's
the police that are telling you what to do, I'd be very surprised if the
police then charge you with violating the law they told you was not a
violation in the first place.

*In short, asking a police officer is about the best advice you can get
short of talking to a lawyer.* Does it rise to the level of "legal
advice?" Technically, no it does not. However, if there is any
organization which works with the law and legal matters as much as
lawyers, it is the police.

Therefore, I would still feel pretty confident accepting advice from the
police on legal matters that pertain exactly to their job, such as
commercial vehicle laws, firearms transportation, etc. I certainly
wouldn't ask them about tax law or corporate law, but they regularly
deal with the portions of the law pertaining to road transportation,
firearms, criminal activity, family law, etc., and I would think they
probably have a decent grasp on those legal concepts for their area.
