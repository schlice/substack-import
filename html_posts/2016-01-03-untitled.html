<h2>Answer Comment</h2>
<div>

**Content:** [The founding fathers saw much technological advance
throughout their lifetimes. They watched warfare progress from the rock
to the stick to the sharpened stick, the spear, the bow and arrow, then
on to the sword and knife, and finally to a musket and rifle.\
\
The first \"Gatling\" gun was even being invented around this time.\
\
So to say that it is inconceivable that the founding fathers could not
have seen technological progress occurring is far from correct.\
\
What they **did** do to overcome that issue was to say that the people
have the right to keep and bear the same types of weapons that the
military uses.\
\
Today, the military uses far more advanced weapons than civilians can
use for legitimate purposes, because smart people saw that coming and
addressed it.]{.rendered_qtext}
