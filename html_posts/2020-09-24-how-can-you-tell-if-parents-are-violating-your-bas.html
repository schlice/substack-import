**How can you tell if parents are violating your basic rights? Are there
violations that could get them time?**

Violating your "basic rights" (by which you probably mean your "civil
rights") is usually not a crime, so no one is going to jail over it.

Can a parent violate your civil rights? Usually not. Your parents
generally have broad latitude in how they are raising you. Unless they
are physically harming you, they aren't really restricted in how they
raise you. That includes violating what adults call "civil rights."

Try to work with your parents. Talk to them about what you would like.
Without threatening them, do inform them that if they don't talk with
you about these rights violations as you see them, it will weigh very
heavily on your decision to pack your stuff and move out of their house
on your 18th birthday and never speak to them again.

So if they refuse to play ball, make sure that as soon as you are
legally able in your state, get a job and start saving money. This way,
when you turn 18, you can walk out the door. Finish high school, and get
on with your life.
