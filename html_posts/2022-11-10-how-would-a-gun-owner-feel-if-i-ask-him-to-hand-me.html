I will gladly hand over my gun

...once you hand over the appropriate amount of money to cover what I
paid for it plus reasonable profit. And a \$100 Target gift card won't
cover it. My pistol is currently selling for \$639.99 [[at Academy
Sports](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=25f662&url=https://www.academy.com/p/smith-wesson-m-p40-m20-40-s-w-full-sized-15-round-pistol){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"

8 of those Target gift cards before I willingly hand over my property.

It's called a "purchase." It's an equitable exchange of money for
property. We do it all the time in society. No drink necessary.

And what you do with it after you buy it is totally up to you. Once I
sell it, it's your responsibility to handle it in accordance with the
law. If you want to give it to the police, feel free. It's your money.

But if you want my gun, you'll have to buy it from me. Any other
"taking" of my property without proper remuneration is *theft.*
