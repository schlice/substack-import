The logic begins and ends with the fact that Jesus is God.

Once you establish that Jesus is God, you can make the next logical
step, which is "Whatever Jesus (who is God) says is true."

Then, you can make the *next* logical step, which is to note that Jesus
said that He is the only way to God (or more specifically, eternal life
with God in heaven).

Therefore, Christians think only Jesus can lead to God because Jesus
(who is God) said that He is the only way.
