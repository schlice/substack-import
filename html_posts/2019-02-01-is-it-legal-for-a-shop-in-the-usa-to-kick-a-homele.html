**Is it legal for a shop in the USA to kick a homeless person out of the
bathroom (let's say the person is a regular customer of the business)?**

Businesses are not "public property." Businesses are owned by private
entities (either people or companies) and they are "open to the public."
This means that people are allowed inside by the owner of the business
as long as they abide by the rules of the business.

The business can set whatever rules they choose for their bathrooms.
They may be "employee-only" bathrooms since OSHA requires a bathroom
on-premises for employees. If they are a food service establishment,
there are state regulations which require accessible bathrooms for
customers who are eating. They may set no rules at all. Perhaps anyone
can use them at any time, paying customer or not (like Starbuck's).
Perhaps anyone of any gender can use any bathroom they choose (like
Target).

Regardless of any rules which may or may not be in place, since the
location is actually a private building (which is open to the public),
the open invitation to enter the premises is **fully revocable for any
reason** by the owner (or the owner's representative, usually the store
manager).

If the store manager says that you are no longer welcome in the store,
in any part of the store, then you must vacate the store immediately, or
you can be arrested for trespassing. There doesn't have to be a reason.
It's certainly not good business practice to eject your customers from
your store, but it's not illegal to do so.

The only caveat: they cannot deny service because of a protected reason
(race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, and in some cities,
sexual orientation).

Beyond that, if the store has a valid reason for ejecting a person, they
can.
