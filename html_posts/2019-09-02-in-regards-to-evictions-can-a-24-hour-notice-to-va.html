**In regards to evictions, can a 24-hour notice to vacate be served
during a weather state of emergency?**

Can you *serve* the notice? Sure, you probably can.

Can you *enforce* the order? Unlikely. You still need the Sheriff to
enforce the order, and the Sheriff will not enforce the order when it is
not safe to do so or when it is unlikely the person will have 24 hours
in which they have the legal ability to comply with the order. They
can't be expected to vacate in the middle of a weather emergency.
