As a taxpayer, I have to say no.

First, the amount of storage that would be required for that amount of
data for that amount of time will become enormous, along with the cost
to maintain that storage. I don't want my police department's IT group
to be the cause of their budget doubling.

Additionally, there are privacy concerns around that data. Cameras are
not permitted in public restrooms, yet police officers are permitted in
public restrooms. So you either have to have the ability to turn the
camera off, or force police officers to not use public restrooms. I'm
sure that police unions will readily approve that. Additionally, what if
a police officer interviews a child rape victim? Is this the kind of
recording you want readily available to anyone with a FOIA request?

And finally, what is to be done when an officer's video feed is obscured
or non-existent? Do you fire the officer? I mean, what did we do
*before* body cameras? We trusted that our police officers were
honorable people and that they told the truth, and in reality, the vast
majority were. Clearly, there are some bad apples who either joined bad
or soured while on the job, and that kind of stuff is always bound to
happen, but this effort to constantly be looking over the shoulder of a
police officer is tantamount to saying, "I don't trust you with the
badge that I entrusted to you."

And if body cameras are good enough to always be running to keep our
police forces in check, how about our politicians? I bet that would
eliminate quite a few shady backroom deals, right?

Body cameras are *tools*, just like every other tool a police officer
carries. It is useful for some things, but it is a hindrance for others.
