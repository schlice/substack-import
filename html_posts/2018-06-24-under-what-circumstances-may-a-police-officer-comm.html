**Is it possible that police officer asks me to take my vehicle for
catching someone? Can he force me to do so? And who is responsible for
the vehicle in that case?**

Short answer, yes a police officer can take your vehicle in an
emergency. It is called "commandeering" a vehicle. Many states have laws
which make it a misdemeanor to fail to render assistance to the police.
Case law suggests that this obligation extends to your car, your
airplane, or anything else that the police reasonably consider helpful
in stopping a criminal or enforcing the law, and failing to do so could
subject you to fines.

Auto insurance is complicated and depending on the state, may require
that your insurance pay your benefits first. These are called "no-fault"
insurance states. In those states, your auto insurance will pay your
auto claims first, and then they will seek remuneration from the police
department's insurer, since the department commandeered the car. But
this is highly state and situation dependent, and would ultimately all
be sorted out by the insurance companies in question.
