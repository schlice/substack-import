**How would you react if your neighbor put a large "Trump-Keep America
Great" sign on their front lawn?**

I'd advise my neighbor that political signs are only allowed by our HOA
no earlier than 30 days before an election and no later than 7 days
after an election. The sign can be no bigger than 12″ by 24″ and you can
have no more than two signs in your yard.

Violations of that rule are handled by our Violations Committee.
