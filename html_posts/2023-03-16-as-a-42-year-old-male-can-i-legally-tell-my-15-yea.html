Legally, you can tell him anything you like. You have freedom of speech.
You may say whatever you like to him.

But freedom of speech implies that you freely accept the *consequences*
of what you say. In order to have free speech at all, you must
understand that **you are not free from consequences** from what you are
freely permitted to say.

So if your nephew's mom never speaks to you again, and she removes your
access to your nephew until he becomes an adult and makes his own
decisions, you must accept this too.

But legally, there is nothing unlawful about telling him what you want
to tell him.
