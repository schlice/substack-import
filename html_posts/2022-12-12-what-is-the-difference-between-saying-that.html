Ah, this is the difference between **pantheism** and **panentheism**.
Look carefully, those are not spelling errors.

**Pantheism** is the belief that the material and the divine are one. A
pantheist would say "God is everything." God is the tree. God is the
air. God is the rock. To a pantheist, God is in all things because God
*is* all things.

**Panentheism** is the belief that the divine permeates every part of
the material world but is not any of those things. They believe the
divine is the "spirit of the universe," but the universe is not the
divine, even though it is dependent on the universe. To a panentheist,
God cannot exist apart from a material universe. So panentheism would
also say that God is in all things, even though God *is not* all things.
