**How many of Jesus\' apostles abandoned their parents, spouses and
children for the Kingdom of God? How and why is that justified?**

All of them. But why is this unjustified?

Is it similarly unjustified when military members leave their parents,
spouses, and children for months at a time for the protection of the
state?

Is it similarly unjustified when some workers take business trips and
leave their parents, spouses, and children and fly overseas for months
at a time for the betterment of their company?

So while the apostles may have been away for longer (estimates say
anywhere from two to three years), is it not the same?

I know, I'm being argumentative. Sorry, I'm feeling a little on guard
today, that's my fault. Actually, if you're talking specifically about
spouses (maybe not parents) and children, there is biblical evidence
that the spouses traveled with the apostles.
