So as I understand it, "Sallah meat" is not a particular cut or
preparation of meat, but it is meat which is prepared as part of the
"Sallah" celebration. Muslims around the world traditionally slaughter a
ram or another animal on **Eid al-Adha**, in memory of the prophet
Ibrahim\'s willingness to sacrifice his own son when Allah ordered him
to do so. As I understand it, Muslims will sometimes offer some of this
"Sallah meat" to their neighbors.

So while the Bible doesn't specifically refer to "Sallah meat," it does
discuss something else that happened in Corinth during Paul's apostolic
term: Christians eating meat which was once sacrificed to idols.

These new Christians in Corinth clearly did not believe in the idols, so
they found no problem going to the temples (which were common gathering
places, which also sold the meat previously sacrificed for people to
eat) and eating the meat.

Paul talks about this in his first letter to the nascent Corinthian
church (1 Corinthians 8):

> Now concerning food offered to idols: we know that "all of us possess
> knowledge." This "knowledge" puffs up, but love builds up. If anyone
> imagines that he knows something, he does not yet know as he ought to
> know. But if anyone loves God, he is known by God.
>
> Therefore, as to the eating of food offered to idols, we know that "an
> idol has no real existence," and that "there is no God but one." For
> although there may be so-called gods in heaven or on earth---as indeed
> there are many "gods" and many "lords"--- yet for us there is one God,
> the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and one
> Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we
> exist.
>
> However, not all possess this knowledge. But some, through former
> association with idols, eat food as really offered to an idol, and
> their conscience, being weak, is defiled. Food will not commend us to
> God. We are no worse off if we do not eat, and no better off if we do.
> But take care that this right of yours does not somehow become a

> brother stumble.

So Paul says a few things notable here:

1.  "Food will not condemn us to God. We are no worse off if we do not
    eat, and no better off if we do." So Paul is saying there is nothing
    specifically wrong with the food itself, and the food itself will
    not "defile us" in some way. This is wholly Biblical and is
    discussed in many places throughout the Bible. Food does not make
    you "unclean."
2.  But there is an issue with Christians in the (former) idol temple
    eating meat sacrificed to idols. *You can cause non-Christians to
    lose any hope of Christian faith.* In other words, if those
    non-Christians see you, a Christian, eating Sallah meat, they may be
    "weakened" by seeing you "sin against your brothers and wounding
    their conscience."

So while you may be confident that the food will not defile you, if your
eating of the food causes the Muslim to believe more strongly in their
faith, then you, as a Christian, are not helping them come to Christ;
you are strengthening their resolve in what you would believe would be a
false teaching. And that would be the sin in eating Sallah meat. To you,
it's just meat. To them, they have successfully had you participate in a
celebration of Allah, *which pushes them further away from Christ and
true salvation.*

And knowingly participating in something which pushes others away from
Christ is sinful.
