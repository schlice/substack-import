The short answer is "we don't know."

What we do know is from *epidemiological studies*, the study of disease
patterns. So we know the types of people who will be susceptible to
developing MS. Anyone can get MS, but there are risk factors that place
one at higher risk of developing the disease. These risk factors include
sex, family history, ethnicity, geography of birth and childhood, and
exposure to an as-of-yet unidentified infectious trigger.

SEX: Females are two to three times more likely to develop MS than
males. Scientists believe that one\'s tendency to develop MS therefore
has some hormonal connection.

FAMILY HISTORY: Statistics show that the chance of the average person in
the United States developing MS is about 1 in 750. But close
(first-degree) relatives of people with MS, such as children, siblings
or non-identical twins, have a higher chance, anywhere from one in 100
to one in 40. It\'s not all genetic, though, and you can see this
through the \"identical twin\" example. If one identical twin has MS,
the other twin (who has the identical gene structure as the twin) has
only a 1 in 4 chance of developing MS. If it were all genetic, the
unaffected twin would have a 100% chance of developing MS instead of the
25% chance they exhibit today.

ETHNICITY: MS is more common among Caucasians (particularly those of
northern European ancestry) than other ethnic groups, and is almost
unheard of in some populations, such as Inuit, Yakutes, Hutterites,
Hungarian Romani, Norwegian Lapps, Australian Aborigines, and New
Zealand Maoris.

GEOGRAPHY: MS occurs with greatest frequency in higher latitudes (above
40Â° latitude) away from the equator, than in lower latitudes, closer to
the equator. This may have something to do with vitamin D production in
the skin, and the vitamin\'s prophylactic effect on the development of
MS. The exact details about vitamin D\'s involvement with the prevention
of MS, however, is still unclear. Moving from one geographic area to
another seems to alter a person\'s risk of developing MS. Studies show
that families and their children will assume the new risk level (higher
or lower) of the area to which they move. Those who move before the age
of 15 generally take on the new risk themselves. Those who move after
the age of 15 may not see the new risk appear until the next generation.

INFECTIOUS TRIGGER: Scientists have been searching for years for an
infectious agent that might trigger MS. While many different viruses
have been suggested, including rabies, herpes simplex virus, measles,
coronavirus, canine distemper virus, HTLV-1, Epstein-Barr virus, among
others, none has yet been confirmed. Chlamydia pneumoniae, a bacteria
which 90% of the population has been exposed to over their lifetime, has
also been suggested but never proven. Although no trigger has yet been
identified, most MS experts believe that some infectious agent is
involved in initiating the disease process.
