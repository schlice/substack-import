The answer is "it depends" and it depends on what specifically you are
talking about.

If you're talking about **firearms**, I would say that most people who
have concealed carry permits practice at a range more frequently than
police officers are required to re-qualify, so it would be easy for a
civilian to become more proficient on their firearms than is minimally
required by the police. Most departments require at least a semi-annual
or an annual recertification. My local department requires a quarterly
re-certification, which, from my anecdotal research, is on the high side
for departments. Most permit holders I know of shoot far more frequently
than that.

This does not mean that an officer can't use his free time and his own
funds to buy ammunition and practice at the range himself. In fact, our
county public range offers a discount to law enforcement, and one whole
section of the range is closed to the public and only allows law
enforcement during daylight hours Monday to Friday. So officers can
indeed practice more frequently than they are required to do so, but the
question didn't ask if someone can be better trained than *every* police
officer; the question asked if it is possible to be better trained than
the police. In this scenario (a private citizen spending every weekend
down at the range, compared to a police officer only shooting when
required by the department), then yes, you can be better trained on
firearms than the police.

If you're talking about **driving**, not likely unless you're a
professional driver. You can't get the kind of driving training that the
police get anywhere but from the police, or from professional driving.

If you're talking about **classroom knowledge**, you could likely learn
as much about the law as police officers know. But in order to learn
about police procedures, and all of the other minutiae about the job,
you would have to be trained directly by the police.
