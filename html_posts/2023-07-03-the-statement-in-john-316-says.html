As long as you use the words "should perish" correctly, **yes.**

If you mean "Unbelief in Christ should rightly result in the second
death in the lake of fire," you're right. If you mean, "I think that
those who do not believe in Him should perish," you would be making an
incorrect implication about me personally. "Should" in this context does
not refer to my desire, it refers to God's imperative.

Yes, some will not be saved. And yes, those who will be saved are the
ones who believe in Him. Logically, therefore, those who will not be
saved are the ones who do not believe in Him. He was very clear about
this:

> Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes
> to the Father except through me." --- John 14:6 NIV

But this is by design. He values our free will *so much* that He will
allow people to make their own choice about their eternal destiny. We
should do no less. We should accept that people should be allowed to
make that choice freely.

But we should ensure that they *know what they're rejecting.* They
should understand that they are rejecting eternal life, eternal
communion with God.

I don't have a problem with a person rejecting Him. But know what you're
rejecting, and reject it with your eyes wide open.
