You don't.

Your learned opinion may very well be that children do best in a common
household with their biological mother and their biological father.
Studies have indeed shown this. The state even incentivizes this
relationship, offering tax breaks for people who structure their lives
like this, so that children can get the best possible chance for a good
outcome.

**But none of that has anything AT ALL to do with the fact that a loving
couple wants to raise a child.** It may not be the most statistically
ideal structure, but that simply does not equate to a bad outcome for
*that* child. Just because a particular structure offers the *best
chance* for a child to have a good outcome later in life **DOES NOT
MEAN** that all other structures are "highly inappropriate." About that
point, you are simply incorrect.

Not to mention that the real *highly inappropriate* part is for you to
tell anyone at all about statistical outcomes based on parental types
unless you are asked.

Stay out of other people's business. Don't give anyone your opinion
unless they ask for it. And even then, politeness and couth might
dictate that you keep your opinion to yourself.
