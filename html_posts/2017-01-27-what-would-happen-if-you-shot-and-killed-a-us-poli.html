You would be arrested and charged with manslaughter, the fact that the
person you killed was a police officer would be an aggravating factor in
most jurisdictions.

As we've said many times on Quora, the intersection between the Castle
Doctrine and the No-Knock Warrant is a dangerous one.

First, we must assume that both of those exist (you live in a
jurisdiction with a strong Castle Doctrine and the police had a No-Knock
Warrant). If it was not a no-knock warrant and the police announced
themselves before and during their entry, shooting them is murder, and
you go to jail if you're still alive. The only scenario in which you
might go to trial for aggravated manslaughter is if the police were
executing a no-knock warrant. If you have no clear Castle Doctrine in
your locality, you also go down for murder, because you don't have an
absolute right to defend your house with deadly force. So for the sake
of this answer, let's assume both of these are true. You get arrested
and charged with aggravated manslaughter.

Then you go to trial.

Do you win? Hard to say. It hasn't happened very often. But homeowners
have indeed won in some of these cases. It is tough; public opinion
tends to favor law enforcement when they are operating in accordance
with the law. So there's no sure answer for how it will go at trial.
