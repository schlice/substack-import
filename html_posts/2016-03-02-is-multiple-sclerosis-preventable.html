We know that Vitamin D has a prophylactic effect against MS. We don\'t
have to know the cause of MS to know that it works, we have proven this
through *epidemiological* studies, which is the study of disease
patterns.

We know that above 40 degrees latitude there is a much higher prevalence
of MS, and researchers believe this may be caused by a decrease in
exposure to direct sunlight, which is a major cause for vitamin D
deficiency. Studies have also shown us that the vast majority of people
who develop MS are deficient in Vitamin D.

We know that vitamin D has a prophylactic effect, but we do not know to
what extent, how it works, or what level of vitamin D is enough.

We also do not know at what age you have to start fixing your vitamin D
levels. We do know through epidemiological studies that when you move to
a new region, you take on the risk factors of that new region. If you
move before age 15, the effects of the new region are seen in the
current generation. If you move after age 15, the effects are seen in
the next generation. So there is some evidence that if you are not
exposed to the positive benefits of a new region before age 15, you
retain the same risk factors with which you grew up.

This may mean that a person who was vitamin D deficient their entire
life (up to age 15) may not benefit from correcting vitamin D levels
now. Again, there is much we do not know.

WARNING: DO NOT alter your vitamin D intake on your own! Work with your
doctor if you feel that vitamin D therapy might be right for you. If you
take too much vitamin D, it may be detrimental.
