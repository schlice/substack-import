Florida resident here, so I actually have some skin in the game.

Yes, we have had deaths. But compared to the number of deaths (per
100,000) in other areas of the country, Florida doesn't even move the
needle. Florida is 25th in the country in terms of deaths per 100K
residents. New York City is first, with 278.7 (NY as a state has 78.9).
Florida has 23.4. The list of states with more deaths per 100K residents
is pretty extensive, and includes NJ, CT, MA, RI, DC, NY, LA, MI, IL,
MD, PA, DE, MS, IN, AZ, CO, GA, NH, MN, NM, OH, AL, IA, and
VA.[\[1\]](#IiXOM){#cite-IiXOM .citation_link}

I bet you're surprised to hear that. That's because you're not being
told the whole story. You're being told every day that there are
X-thousand number of new cases in Florida, breaking all previous one-day
records. Without additional context, however, this only tells you the
pervasiveness and the effectiveness of our testing. Are these people
symptomatic? Were they hospitalized? Not even close. You're also being
told that "doing more testing" is not a valid reason for seeing more
cases. Really? As of this week, we're now testing anyone who walks in
the door and says they want to be tested. Just two weeks ago, you had to
be symptomatic and over 65, even at our drive-up testing locations.
Today, anyone can drive in and get tested. And we're finding lots of
people who are asymptomatic.

And with the record numbers of people reporting that they are infected,
our low death rates are a testament to the fact that Florida took steps
to protect the most vulnerable among us: the elderly. As you know,
Florida has whole cities of nothing but retirees (i.e The Villages). We
put strict rules in place to protect those communities. For example,
unlike New York, we don't return COVID-positive seniors back to their
homes. We set up twelve COVID-positive assisted living facilities around
the state; that's where seniors go when they test positive, not back to
their communities to infect others.

You're also being told that ICUs are filling up. Again, data without
context, just to scare you. Are those all COVID patients? Actually, only
around 15% of ICU patients are COVID cases. The rest? Remember when
people were deferring hospital visits and surgeries because they were
afraid to go to the hospital? Now they're coming in, and their
conditions are worse than before. So (surprise, surprise) they have to
go to the ICU for care. So ICU capacity is down because we're seeing
more ICU patients for lots of reasons, some only tangentially related to
the pandemic. Also, hospitals have put plans in place to essentially
double their ICU capacity if they need to. They don't need to, yet. But
you're still being told that there is no ICU space. Data without
context.

You're being told that there are all of these counties in Florida that
have no ICU capacity. A grain of truth in a sea of misinformation. Many
rural counties in Florida have no ICU capacity, period. Their critical
cases must be shipped to a larger city nearby for intensive care.
They've never had ICU capacity.

It does appear that this information is selectively and creatively being
reported, just to scare you. Don't let the media win. Don't let them
scare you! The number of people who are reporting as positive does not
equal the number of people showing symptoms. And the number of people
dying is dropping every day.

*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.
Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a
civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not
misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously. My mental well-being
isn\'t worth your harassing, inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I
wrote, tough shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is
un-cited opinion masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m
wrong, write your own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site,
not a debate site. If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually,
you\'re wrong,\" don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment.
Put anything vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be
followed by a block and a mute. I will do this immediately and with no
compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*
