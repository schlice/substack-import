We don't really know why the number was set at three *and not longer*.
We do know why it wasn't *fewer than* three days, but we don't know why
God chose *three* as the number of days to remain dead.

We know that it could not have been *less than* three days, because it
was Jewish belief at the time that the soul stayed with the body for
three days before departing. If He had only stayed dead for a day or
two, then it would have been easier for the Jews to claim that Jesus
never really died. We know that Jesus also intentionally delayed in
visiting Lazarus' tomb so that no one would be able to question the
miracle. God may have chosen three days for the same reason.

It is also possible that the death/resurrection timetable was timed
around the week: Jesus died on a Friday, Nisan 14, the day when the
Passover lamb was sacrificed. His death, the death of a perfect,
unblemished sacrifice on our behalf, mirrors the Passover lamb. Jesus is
often referred to as "the Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the
world." His resurrection on the third day took place on the first day of
the week, illustrating a new beginning and new life. Thus, the choice of
day and the choice of the amount of time also appear to be very
symbolic.
