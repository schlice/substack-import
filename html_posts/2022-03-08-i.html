So let's make sure we're not talking about the *religious view* on
marriage. We're only talking about the *secular* view of marriage as a
legal contract which ensures the generativity of any children you may
produce, and provides certain tax and death benefits.

Sex outside of marriage is not (or more accurately, no longer) a crime.
But you should still discuss it with your wife, and find out why she
won't have sex with you any more.

If it's important to you, but it's not important to her, but you don't
want to divorce, maybe she'd be comfortable allowing you to "get your
needs met" elsewhere. Maybe work out a schedule, or look into paying for
an escort on a regular basis.

Perhaps she could engage in any number of "non-penetrative" sexual
activities with you, which might be acceptable to both of you. There are
certainly options, but she needs to be open to taking care of your
needs.

The trick is that she needs to understand that she is in the wrong here,
because she is the one not fulfilling her obligations under the marriage
contract. Depending on the state in which you get a divorce, this could
count against her if you file for divorce citing failure to fulfill the
marital contract. So it behooves her to work with you.

So that was a very long way round to say that if she's willing to work
with you, you don't need to divorce her. But you would certainly have
sufficient grounds to do so.

Original question:

I\'m 49. My wife won\'t have sex with me anymore. Do you think I should
remain faithful to her? We have a great son together, but I would love
to have some action. It\'s been 13 years.
