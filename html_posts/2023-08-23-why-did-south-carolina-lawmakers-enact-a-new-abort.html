Interesting, sounds like a law school question, but whatever, I'll bite.

Basically, SC took the objections to the first law raised by Justice Few
the first time around and wrote them into the new law.

**Essentially, this all is occurring because South Carolina has a right
to privacy in its state constitution.** However, that right can have
reasonable restrictions placed on it if the state can show that the
compelling state interest being advocated for outweighs the state
constitution's right to privacy and right to bodily autonomy.

So when the updated law was passed a second time, the Legislature openly
acknowledged that restricting abortion infringes on South Carolina's
constitutional right to privacy and bodily autonomy, but they reasonably
determined this time around that those interests don\'t outweigh "the
interest of the unborn child to live."

As expected, Planned Parenthood South Atlantic (among other abortion
providers) sued again.

This time, however, the SC Supreme Court said that the Legislature's
determination that the right of the child to live overrode the woman's
right to privacy and the woman's right to bodily autonomy was
reasonable. Therefore, they allowed the new law to stand. Writing for
the new majority, Justice John Kittredge wrote, "As a Court, unless we
can say that the balance struck by the legislature was unreasonable as a
matter of law, we must uphold the Act."

The fact that the SC Supreme Court is the only all-male Supreme Court in
the nation is a red herring. The previous ruling was objected to by more
than the lone woman (who reached mandatory retirement age in SC),
including the aforementioned Justice John Few.
