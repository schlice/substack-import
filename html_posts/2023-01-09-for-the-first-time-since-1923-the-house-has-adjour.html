Yes, everyone has been in full-on panic mode because the House adjourned
without a speaker. But finally though, Kevin McCarthy was elected
Speaker of the House.

No, the process to elect a new Speaker was not easy. But nothing
worthwhile ever is.

Some people are saying that this weakened the Republican party, or that
this weakened the Speaker. I disagree. McCarthy proved that he is
strong. He proved that he is capable of listening and compromise, and
capable of the change that America deserves. Ultimately, the House
Freedom Caucus, and McCarthy himself, emerge strong.

This process may have been strange, and perhaps a bit worrying, for
some. But I submit to you that this is ***exactly what good government
looks like***. It's *open debate* and *working towards compromise*. That
sort of debate has been absent from the floor of the House for the past
six years. Former Rep. Jodi Hice said in an interview that most of his
colleagues have never seen Congress "operate the way it was intended to
operate." "People need to be aware," he said, "it's been over six years
since members of Congress have been allowed to offer an amendment to the
bill on the floor of the House of Representatives. And many who are
serving in Congress right now have never known any other system than
that which currently exists, where deals are made in backrooms and then
bills just dropped on the floor, and you're expected to vote on it right
away."

Tony Perkins, head of the Family Research Council, summed it up this
way: "The reality is, the transference of power, like every issue
confronting Congress, was never meant to be predetermined by a powerful
few. It was meant to be --- as all governing was meant to be --- a
dynamic process where everyone has a voice. And yet Americans have grown
so accustomed to things being forced upon us that when we actually see
the process functioning as it should, we
panic."[\[1\]](#uzSAR){#cite-uzSAR .citation_link}

Ultimately, if anyone lost in all of this, it's the Left. The days of
backroom deals and snap votes on the House floor are all but over. Let's
get back to open debate. Let's get back to giving Representatives a
chance to read bills before they must vote on them. Let's get back to
some form of good governance, something we haven't seen in years.
