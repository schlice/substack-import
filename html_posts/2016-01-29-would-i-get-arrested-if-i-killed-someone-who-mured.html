Yep. Killing someone who murdered any untold millions of people is still
murder. You would still be arrested.

What you\'re talking about is ***justification***, which is something
for a jury to decide, after you are arrested and charged, and placed on
trial.

The only difference would be if you killed someone who was in the
*process* of killing dozens of people, in which case you would be
killing someone in self-defense (defense of others is self-defense).
