So long as any resale of any product is allowed, the answer is yes.

The typical type of private sale is called an "as-is" sale. Unless prior
arrangements are made, this is the condition of sale that is assumed.
This is because private sellers are not held to the same standards as
retailers. For example, if you private sell a car, the seller is not
required to ensure the car passes a state inspection before selling it.
The seller is also not required to sanitize the inside of the car before
selling it, considering what sorts of behaviors may go on in the back
seat of said car.

Therefore, if you buy a used keyboard, It is up to you to sanitize the
equipment after you buy it; there is no sanitization standard for any
private sale.

*Caveat emptor.*
