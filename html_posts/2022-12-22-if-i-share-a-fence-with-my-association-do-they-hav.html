Chances are, the fence is not directly on the property line. Chances are
the fence is squarely either on your property, or on the HOA's property.

Where the fence actually is built will determine who has to fix it,
because it will determine who owns the fence.

Therefore, in order to properly determine who must replace the fence,
you will need a **survey** performed to locate the actual property line.

The results of that survey will be used to determine ownership of the
fence.
