Just curious, what other rights should we make dependent on whether or
not you pay taxes? Should churches be subject to searches without a
warrant? Protection against unreasonable searches should only be
reserved for groups that pay taxes, right? Should pastors who receive
salaries paid for by tax free money be afforded Miranda rights? Should
they be free from self-incrimination? They don\'t pay taxes, so why
should they? For that matter, why provide them police or fire services?
They didn\'t pay for them!
