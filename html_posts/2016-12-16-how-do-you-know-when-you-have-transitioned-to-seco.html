[[Erica
Friedman](https://www.quora.com/profile/Erica-Friedman)]{.qlink_container}
is right on: you will have officially transitioned to SPMS when you and
your doctor agree that you have.

To that end, *how* will you and your doctor know that your have
transitioned? You will make the call together, but you will notice that
you relapse, and you never fully remit. This can happen on an individual
level, even in RRMS, so a single instance is not enough to call it. When
a *pattern emerges,* however, you and your doctor may take notice. When
you have consistent, *multiple* relapses with incomplete remission, it
may be time to say that you have transitioned. Any time you relapse,
please make sure your neurologist is informed. They will want to track
that, and perhaps (as you indicated) check your EDSS at your next
appointment.

Also, EDSS is not a "test" that you can "pass or fail." EDSS stands for
Expanded Disability Status Scale, and is a scale from 0 to 10, where 0
is no disability at all noted in the neurological exam, and 9 is
completely bedridden. 9.5 is bedridden and unable to communicate, and 10
is death due to MS.

There is [[a really great
article](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d41e98&url=https://www.mscenter.org/images/stories/PDF/InforMSFall2015lowres.pdf){.external_link

*InforMS,* the periodical published by the Rocky Mountain MS Center,
regarding neutral load and what may be happening in the brain when we
transition from RRMS to SPMS.
