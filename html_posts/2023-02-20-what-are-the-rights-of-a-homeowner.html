None.

Property disputes between neighbors are not within the scope of the
HOA's responsibilities. Trees that cross property lines are property
disputes between homeowners.

In most jurisdictions, homeowners may trim trees that overhang into
their property, at their own expense. Homeowners may not cross into
neighboring property to do so. So in most cases, if a tree is growing
over the fence into your yard, you may trim the part that is overgrowing
into your yard, at your expense. If you want to hire an arborist to do
that work, you may, but it's at your expense, not your neighbor's. Check
your local laws before you do this.

**If your neighbor's tree falls and damages your property**, fault will
depend on the health of the tree at the time it fell.

- If it was *healthy*, and it fell because of some external reason (i.e.
  a hurricane blew it over), you (or more specifically, your homeowner's
  insurance) will be responsible to pay for your repairs.
- If it was *dead* and it fell, your neighbor (or more specifically,
  their insurance) will be responsible to pay for for your repairs.

If your neighbor's tree is dead or dying, it is imperative that you
notify them right away that they must address the known hazard before it
causes damage. Your timely notification of the hazard will not only
prove that it was dead before it fell (thus allowing you to make a claim
if it does fall), but it will give the neighbor the opportunity to
address the hazard before it causes damage. If they refuse, you cannot
force them to do so, and neither can the HOA. But if it then falls and
it damages your property, they are liable for the damages. And if they
knew about the hazard and did nothing, their homeowner's insurance won't
even cover it; they'll have to pay for the damages out of their own
pocket. You can sue them and recover the money for the damage done to
your property. To that end, if you do contact them, make sure you keep
copies of all correspondence and the fact that they received it (i.e.
sending certified mail with a return receipt).
