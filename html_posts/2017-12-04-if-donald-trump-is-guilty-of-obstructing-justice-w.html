**If Donald Trump is guilty of obstructing justice, what are the chances
that VP Pence and Speaker Ryan were not complicit? If Trump is
impeached, is it likely that Pence and Ryan can be immediately impeached
as well?**

What's with the multiple questions? Let's start with the first one
because that leads to the second.

**If Donald Trump is guilty of obstructing justice, what are the chances
that VP Pence and Speaker Ryan were not complicit?**

Donald Trump is not guilty of obstructing justice.

Trump was exercising his power as the head of the Executive Branch under
Article II. *This action cannot be illegal*, because it is a power
directly granted to the President in the Constitution. If that action
violates a law, then the law is unconstitutional. The Constitution is
not at fault, the law is.

So, was the President guilty of the crime of obstructing justice by
firing Comey? In short, **no**, he was not.

Did Trump fire Comey to stop the investigation? Also, **no** he did not.
You do know that there is more than one person that works at the FBI,
right? If Trump wanted to stop the investigation, as the person in
charge of the Executive Branch, *he could have directed the FBI to stop
the investigation.* But he did not do this. If he did, it would have
been seen as highly suspect, and perhaps then, he could have been
impeached on an abuse of power charge. As it stands though, there still
isn't an impeachable offense here, and his actions so far don't amount
to anything other than discharging his duties under the Constitution.

**If Trump is impeached, is it likely that Pence and Ryan can be
immediately impeached as well?**

No, cases would have to be brought against each individual for
individual contributions.
