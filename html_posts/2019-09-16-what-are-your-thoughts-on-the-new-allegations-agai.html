**What are your thoughts on the new allegations against Brett Kavanaugh
(September 2019)?**

I'm literally falling out of my chair laughing at the people who believe
this is actually *credible*.

Several points about this "new" allegation:

1.  The FBI was notified about this allegation. They didn't "fail to
    investigate," and the President didn't order them to not
    investigate. *They determined, all on their own, that there wasn't
    enough evidence,* and so they did not investigate further. They,
    apparently, saw how thin the evidence was, and let it go. Good thing
    we have the NYT to investigate things that the FBI won't touch with
    a 10-foot pole.
2.  Max Stier, the man who gave the story to the NYT, won't confirm the
    story publicly, but don't you worry, your intrepid authors
    "confirmed the account with two officials who have communicated with
    him." That's good, glad you got your double-hearsay quota in there.
3.  Stier, Stier, that name sounds familiar. Wasn't he a defense
    attorney for the Clinton's? Why yes, yes he was. Hmm, the plot
    thickens.
4.  Probably the most damning thing conveniently omitted from the
    *Times* article: the woman Stier accuses Kavanaugh of assaulting
    denies any memory of the incident. You'll note that the *Times*
    (that paragon of ethical reporting with integrity and stuff) did
    correct their article and included this little tidbit, but as we say
    in legal circles, you can't un-ring a bell.

So, the grand question: ***why now***? Wasn't this story thoroughly
debunked and buried a long time ago? Isn't Kavanaugh a bona fide Supreme
Court Justice now?

Just when we're scratching our collective heads wondering why this is
happening now, this shows up in everyone's Twitter feeds:

And here it is.

This article is what is known as *political cover.* The article allows
politicians (and in this case, Democratic Presidential candidates) to
take a position popular with their base, and win some free brownie
points. They can then point back to the article (as you see several of
them have), and use it as the basis to support their position. "SEE?
THERE'S ANOTHER ALLEGATION! IMPEACH IMPEACH IMPEACH!"

Regardless that this particular accusation is ***EVEN THINNER*** than
the previous one (at least in that one, it was the alleged victim who
came forward; in this case, it's bad hearsay and the alleged victim
denies it even happened).

It's not even worth the fishwrap it was printed on. But that never
stopped the *Times* from printing it anyway. It's absolute trash. But
that's what we have come to expect from them these days. And Democratic
Presidential candidates are all too happy to grab it and lean on it,
despite the fact that it is utter feces.
