**Do you think Quora would remove your answer if it was found to be
pro-Trump?**

We have an entire Space on Quora dedicated to answers which are
decidedly pro-Trump. You should check it out.

[[War Elephant](https://warelephant.quora.com/)]{.qlink_container}

It is the largest military and conservative political space on Quora
with over 51.8K followers.

But that's not why our stuff is not removed.

Our stuff is not removed because we follow a simple rule regarding our
content. We like to call it the **3 R's:**

***Relaxed. Researched. Respectful.***

Here's what [[Joshua
Alexander](https://www.quora.com/profile/Joshua-Alexander-356)]{.qlink_container},
the owner of War Elephant, says about the 3 R's:

> **Relaxed**
>
> People get too strung up about politics. The purpose of politics isn't
> the constant pursuit of power. It's to serve you so that you don't
> have to worry about politics. We aren't a motivated advocacy group
> electioneering or driven to defeat our political enemies. We have no
> enemies. We're part lounge, part classroom, and part message-board,
> where people can come and go as they please; to read, learn,
> socialize, and then live their lives. I want people to leave us and
> just appreciate how wonderful it is to be alive today, right now, but
> to think back to that thing we shared with them. And I want them to
> say in that quiet moment, "I never thought of it that way. It kind of
> made a lot of sense." - Relaxed
>
> **Researched**
>
> Our opinions face a scrutiny like few others ever have. Here, we have
> to write like our worst enemy is our closest follower --- because they
> are, so we can't be lazy. We have to be more than opinions and empty
> rhetoric. Everything that comes through War Elephant needs to follow a
> standard of excellence that leaves the casual reader drifting in and
> saying, "Whoa! I wasn't expecting that." It won't be hard. They've
> been taught that we're unintelligent, uninformed, and something to be
> underestimated. Read, study, write clearly, and cite your sources.
> Make people walk away with the uncomfortable feeling of doubt. Doubt
> in their assumptions about not only our beliefs, but about ourselves,
> as well. - Researched.
>
> **Respectful**
>
> We want others who disagree with us to hear us. To do that, we can't
> bash them every third post. That only confirms suspicions and builds
> barriers to learning. It proves to those who already hate us they were
> right. We have to be better. Without compromising our values to suit
> others, we have to work extra hard to make sure our words can be
> heard. We do that by being respectful. Always. An errant comment, a
> lazy post, or a moment of anger at someone who isn't being a very good
> guest will ruin a great deal of work others do. We have to be better.
>
> Perhaps most important of the three, I want this space to be known as
> a place where people feel respected even by people telling them
> they're wrong. At this time, when so many very influential people
> demand incivility, intolerance, and resistance from their follower, I
> think most people just want to find something welcoming, but might be
> too afraid of their own side to say so.
>
> This is the hardest of the three R's, and the one I'm going to push
> the strictest to ensure is part of our culture. I think without it,
> once we grow much bigger, we may be surrounded by so many people
> diseased with the toxin of hurt and resentment, that they want this
> place to be their staging ground for assault. We are War Elephant, but
> we are never about fighting other Americans. -
> Respectful.[\[1\]](#cUnzu){#cite-cUnzu .citation_link}
