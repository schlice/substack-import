The rules for what vehicles may park in what spaces are all laid out in
your Governing Documents. You should have received those rules when you
moved in to your house. If you don't have them, get them from your HOA.
They explain what cars can park where, and whether or not you are
permitted to park vehicles in those spaces which are not registered to
you, and what the procedure is should you choose to do so.

The HOA is responsible for making sure that only vehicles registered to
the owner of the space are parked in those spaces. They can tow vehicles
registered to others when parked in paid spaces. As long as this is
their job in the Governing Documents, it is perfectly legal.

If you parked a car registered to someone else in that space and you
didn't notify the HOA, or follow their procedure for what to do when you
want to park a car in your space that's not registered to you, that's on
you.
