Apple is a **hardware** provider.

They also provide embedded and cloud-based software to run their
hardware. iCloud is just such a solution, along with their
[[iCloud.com](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6cff7d&url=http://icloud.com){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="icloud.com"}]{.qlink_container} email addresses.

Therefore, to create an iCloud email account, **you must first buy an
Apple product**. That could be an iPhone, an iPad, an Apple Watch, or a
MacBook.

Once you purchase one of those, you can create an iCloud account. Your
account will include an iCloud email address.
