I'm certain the original officer advised the man to not get behind the
wheel of his car before he left. He wasn't going to confiscate the guy's
keys. He also wasn't going to sit there and babysit him. The officer
advised him not to drive, and left.

Some people are simply too stupid to get out of their own way.
