They can be *justified*. You can justify your actions in any way you
choose, such as "the majority of people in the population act with human
rights and dignity, so that's what makes it right."

Justification without God is not the problem. *Grounding your ideology*
is. Locating a **common source** for your ideology is impossible without
God.

Without a divine giver of justice, a single source for rights and
ideology, you can justify your actions in any way you choose, and it is
no more or less "right" than anyone else's justification.

For example, I could say that human rights is whatever gets me the most
of everything, and I can kill you to get your stuff to advance my human
rights, and dignity means killing you quickly so that you don't suffer
because I just want to get my stuff in the quickest way possible, and my
justification could be that my ideology means whatever is best for me is
what I do. And that ideology is no more or less right than the ideology
which says that whatever the majority of the population thinks is right
is actually what is right.

Without some way to ground the ideology, to ground the belief, then no
one's belief is any more or less right than anyone else's belief.
