No, I have a simpler solution.

Just make it illegal for any woman to be unmarried.

See? No more loners! If it's "marry the weird guy who owns the cat" or
"do 10 to 20 in the state pen" I bet there won't be too many loners any
more.

If you don't find the above statement ridiculous, I fear for you.
