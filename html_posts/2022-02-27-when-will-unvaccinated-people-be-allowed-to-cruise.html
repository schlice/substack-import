Since I am not a militant vaxxer, nor am I anti-cruise, I feel like I
can actually answer your question.

The answer is: ***when they have taken enough financial losses to
finally admit defeat and start returning life to normal.***

The CDC allowed the Conditional Sail Order (CSO) mandating 100%
vaccinated passengers to expire on January 15, 2022. At that time, they
***recommended*** the cruise lines voluntarily follow the [[COIVD-19
Program for Cruise
Ships](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ee704f&url=https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/cruise/management/technical-instructions-for-cruise-ships.html){.external_link

qt-tooltip="cdc.gov"}]{.qlink_container}. *On January 15th,* all major
cruise lines did opt in to the program. The program includes being
labeled as a "good boy" on the CDC's list of [[Cruise Line
Status](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f81c12&url=https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/cruise/cruise-ship-color-status.html){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="cdc.gov"}]{.qlink_container} if you have 95% of your
passengers (excluding children) fully vaccinated, and being labeled as a
"bad boy" if you didn't have 95% of your passengers and crew
vaccinated.\* The major cruise lines, of course, opted in to the program
by creating health and safety rules which demanded that all passengers
and crew be fully vaccinated, up to date, and tested before boarding.

Some people, especially those who had COVID-19 and recovered (and now
that Omicron has literally swept the population, that number is growing
by leaps and bounds), are simply disinterested in being vaccinated
against a virus for which they already have immunity. So they won't
sail, despite their love for cruising.

And the cruise lines have been feeling the pinch of cruisers "opting
out" of cruising. They have lost *billions* in revenue since the start
of the pandemic. And they know full well that if they continue like
this, it won't be long before their reserve coffers run dry and they're
out of business. They built up massive war chests before the pandemic
and they've been living off of those reserves, but they can't keep doing
that forever.

In other words, *they cannot keep operating like this and expect to stay
in business.*

At some point, some major cruise line will *be forced* to make the
difficult decision to allow unvaccinated passengers on board. And it
will be a *windfall* for that cruise line. They'll be booked solid once
they make the announcement. There is definitely pent-up demand for
cruising, but people want *normal* cruising where they can *relax*. They
don't want this virus panic on the ship. They want to *get away* from
virus panic.

\* Of course, they didn't call them "good boy" and "bad boy." They
called them the more politically-correct terms of "Highly Vaccinated" or
"Not Highly Vaccinated."
