Jesus taught this at His famous Sermon on the Mount. I'm going to paste
quite a bit of it here, try to read it with an open mind and an open
heart. Let the words speak to you.

Notice in that second paragraph where it talks about the people who did
all the good deeds but didn't believe? That's the answer to your
question. They did all the good things, but because they didn't believe,
they will still be told, at the end, "Away from me, you **evildoers**.
***I never knew you."***

And look at all the amazing things they did! They prophesied in Jesus'
name! (I bet you'll see plenty of pastors in hell after the last day
because of this). They *literally used the power of Jesus to cast out
demons!* But doing all those amazing things alone did not save them.

And that's the point. **Works alone will not save you**. Works *grow out
of salvation*, not the other way around. The works are important,
therefore, because *they indicate the salvation*. If you don't see the
works, you can bet that there's no salvation.

But importantly, you *can* still see the works *without* the salvation.
The **source** of the works matters though, because when there's no
salvation, the works come from yourself. When you are saved, the works
come from the spirit of God.

Who are you representing when you do good works? Are you representing
yourself, or are you acting as a beacon of God's love? Which love is
more lasting? Which love matters more?

(EDIT) Since it seems this answer is causing confusion, let me give
another Bible answer which illustrates what the Bible says is the
ultimate destination of those who do not believe in God but are still
good people. *Can they earn their way to salvation?*

Matthew 19 has the story of the rich man which may also help our
understanding regarding this:

> Just then a man came up to Jesus and asked, "Teacher, what good thing
> must I do to get eternal life?"
>
> "Why do you ask me about what is good?" Jesus replied. "There is only
> One who is good. If you want to enter life, keep the commandments."
>
> "Which ones?" he inquired.
>
> Jesus replied, "'You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery,
> you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, honor your
> father and mother,' and 'love your neighbor as yourself.'"
>
> "All these I have kept," the young man said. "What do I still lack?"
>
> Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions
> and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come,
> follow me."
>
> When the young man heard this, he went away sad, because he had great
> wealth.
>
> Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for
> someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you,
> it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for
> someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God."
>
> When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked,
> "Who then can be saved?"
>
> Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with
> God all things are possible." (Matthew 19:16--26 NIV)

The first thing we note in this story is that the rich man is asking a
good question: "What good deed must I do to have eternal life?" In
asking the question, he acknowledges the fact that, despite all his
efforts to be a good person thus far, there is something lacking, and he
wants to know what else must be done to obtain eternal life. However, he
is asking the question from the wrong worldview---that of merit ("What
good deed *must I do?*"); he has failed to grasp the true meaning of the
Law, as Jesus will point out to him, which was to serve as a tutor until
the time of Christ (Galatians 3:24).

The second thing to note is Jesus' response to his question. Jesus asks
a question in return: why is he inquiring into what is good? Jesus gets
to the heart of the matter, namely, that no one is good and no one does
good except God.

The young man is operating under a false premise: **that a good person
is able to earn his way into heaven.** This is the focus of the OP's
question: what the Bible says about someone who is loving and kind but
does not believe; what happens to those who believe that they can earn
their own way into heaven without belief in God or Christ.

To make His point, Jesus says that, if the young man wants eternal life,
he should keep the commandments. In saying this, Jesus is not advocating
a works-based righteousness. Rather, Jesus is challenging the young
man's suppositions by showing the man's shallow understanding of the Law
and human ability.

The young man's response is telling. When told to keep the commandments,
he asks Jesus, "Which ones?" Jesus continues to gently show the man the
error of his ways by giving him the commandments that deal with our
relationships to other people. You can almost sense the frustration in
the young man's response when he tells Jesus that he has kept all of
these since his youth---he insists that he's been a good person.

Jesus then tells him that, if he wishes to be perfect---a truly good
person---he must sell all that he has and come follow Him. Jesus has
perfectly diagnosed what the young man truly "lacks"---his attachment to
his wealth. The man's great wealth has become an idol in his life. He
claimed to have kept all the commandments, but in reality, he couldn't
even keep the first one, to have no other gods before the Lord!

The young man turned his back on Jesus and walked away. His god was his
wealth, which he chose over Jesus.

Jesus then turns to His disciples to teach them a principle: "Again I
tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle
than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God." This was
shocking to the disciples, who held the common idea that riches were a
sign of God's blessing. But Jesus points out that riches often are, in
their tendency to fuel self-sufficiency, an obstacle to faith. His
disciples ask, "Who then can be saved?" Jesus answers by reminding the
disciples that salvation is of God: "With man this is impossible, but
with God all things are possible."

Who then *can* be saved? If left up to man alone, no one! **Why is being
a good person not enough to get you into heaven?** ***Because no one is
a "good" person!*** There is only One who is good, and that is God
Himself. No one can keep the Law perfectly. The Bible says that all have
sinned and fallen short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23). The Bible
also says that the wages of our sin is death (Romans 6:23a).
Fortunately, God did not wait until we somehow learned to be "good;"
while we were still sinners, Christ died for us (Romans 5:8).

Salvation is not based on *our* goodness but on *Jesus*' goodness. If we
confess with our mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in our hearts that
God raised him from the dead, we will be saved (Romans 10:9). This
salvation in Christ is a precious gift, and, like all true gifts, it is
unearned (Romans 6:23; Ephesians 2:8--9). The message of the gospel is
that we can never be good enough to get to heaven. We must recognize
that we are sinners who fall short of God's glory, and we must obey the
command to repent of our sins and place our faith and trust in Jesus
Christ. Christ alone was a "good person"---good enough to earn
heaven---and He gives His righteousness to those who believe in His name
(Romans 1:17).

Back to the original question. What does the Bible say about someone who
does not believe? **If they do not confess with their mouth that Jesus
is Lord and believe in their hearts that God raised Him from the dead,
they will not be saved.** Regardless of how loving or kind they are.
Regardless of what deeds they have done. Regardless of anything they
even have the ability to *do*. The only thing that will save you is
**repentance and belief.** **Salvation without belief is impossible.**
