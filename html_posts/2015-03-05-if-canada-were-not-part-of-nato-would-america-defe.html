**Content:** [Absolutely.\
\
Canada shares one of the longest open borders with us between any two
nations in the world. It\'s in our national interest to keep Canada
sovereign.\
\
We have several joint ventures with Canada, and one of the most notable
of them is
[[NORAD](https://www.quora.com/topic/NORAD)]{.qlink_container} , the
North American Aerospace Defense Command, a joint US/Canadian military
command, tasked with defending North America. If aircraft were to start
invading either territory, NORAD aircraft would be intercepting those
aircraft, so in a way, we would be defending Canada by default.\
\
We share resources with Canada when it comes to our mutual defense;
through NORAD, Canada hosts the \"DEW Line\" (the Distant Early Warning
Line) of radar stations along the northern border, which was originally
watching over the Polar ice cap waiting for Russian Bear bombers to head
towards Ottawa and Washington D.C. The United States hosts PARCS radar
stations along both coasts, watching for those inbound aircraft.\
\
We are virtually \"joined at the hip\" with Canada, and it would be a
difficult argument to make that the defense of Canada is not in the best
interest of the United States.]{.rendered_qtext}
