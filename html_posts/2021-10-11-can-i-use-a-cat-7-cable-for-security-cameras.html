The answer is: yes you can, but you don't need it.

CAT 7 cable has a few unique features, like being one of the first
cables to offer 10 GB/sec speed up to 100 meters. At the time of its
development, it was faster than anything else.

But CAT 7 cables are **proprietary.** They don't use traditional
Ethernet cable headers. They use a GG45 connecter, which is proprietary.
And while there is backwards compatibility with RJ45, those connecters
are hard to come by.

In fact, the proprietary nature of CAT 7 cables was what drove the
development of the nearly-equally-performing CAT 6a cable. Yes, that
means that CAT 6a cable is actually newer than CAT 7, but as you can
see, people look at the two and think that CAT 7 must be newer even
though it is not.

So in short, you probably don't need CAT 7. For most installations, you
can use CAT 6a, or even CAT 8 cable if you need it.
