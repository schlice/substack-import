Saul Alinsky's seminal work, *Rules for Radicals,* says "never let a
good crisis go to waste." I see you've read his work.

Using a tragedy (a shooting at a parade) to push your political agenda
(removing firearms from law-abiding citizens) is poor form.

First, there is no correlation between criminals committing crimes and
law-abiding citizens owning firearms for their personal protection.

Second, when do we start blaming the criminal instead of the tool?

Third, why is only "gun violence" something we need to worry about?
Can't we also worry about "sexual assault" and the recent string of
"burglary in broad daylight"? Aren't there other things, things which
are far more destructive and devastating, that we can devote our
attention to fixing?
