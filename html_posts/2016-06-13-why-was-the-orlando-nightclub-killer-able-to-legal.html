"Being investigated by the FBI" is not the same thing as "being a
convicted felon."

There are only a very small number of categories of people who are
prohibited from exercising their rights as American citizens under the
Second Amendment:

- Persons under indictment for, or convicted of, any felony crime
  punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year
- Fugitives from justice
- Persons who are unlawful users of, or addicted to, any controlled
  substance
- Persons who have been declared **by a court** as mental defectives or
  have been committed to a mental institution
- Illegal aliens or aliens who were admitted to the United States under
  a non-immigrant visa
- Persons who have been dishonorably discharged from the Armed Forces
- Persons who have renounced their United States citizenship
- Persons subject to certain types of restraining orders
- In some states, persons accused of domestic violence; in all states,
  persons convicted of domestic violence.[\[1\]](#qqzAD){#cite-qqzAD

If you do not belong to one of these restricted classes, your rights
under the Second Amendment are not revoked.
