The law says they cannot directly ask about your disability, but if you
bring a service animal into the workplace, they can absolutely *assume*
you have a disability, **especially when you answer the two questions
that they are allowed to ask**:

- Is that animal required because of a disability?
- What work or task is that animal trained to perform?

These questions may not be asked if the need for the service animal is
obvious. So if the person is clearly blind, there is no need to ask if
it is a seeing-eye dog.
