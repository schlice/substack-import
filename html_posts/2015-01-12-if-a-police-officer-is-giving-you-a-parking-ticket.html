Two issues here:

1\. Parking in a \"Red Zone\"\
2. Leaving the scene

1\. Parking in a \"Red Zone\": Color-blindness would only be an
affirmative defense if you could show that there was no \"text\"
anywhere that stated that it was a \"no parking\" zone (such as a sign,
or words spray-painted on the curb). If the curb was only colored, and
there was no other indication using text that described the no-parking
zone, you could claim it as a defense against the ticket in court.

2\. However, you have to receive the ticket before you can contest it.
If you get in your car and drive away, your license plate (which was
already recorded) will be reported to the police, and you will be
charged not only with the parking violation, but with leaving the scene,
as well as potential charges of bodily harm against the parking
enforcement personnel.

Bottom line: bad idea. Allow them to complete the ticket, take pictures
of the area in question, and fight it in court.

As many of us have said when dealing with law enforcement, you have many
options and remedies. NONE of these remedies takes place AT THE SCENE.
Let them finish what they are doing and then take them to court.

(EDIT) In most jurisdictions, leaving while a parking enforcement
official is writing a ticket is, in and of itself, another traffic
offense. So more than likely, what will happen is you will get two
tickets. In the mail.
