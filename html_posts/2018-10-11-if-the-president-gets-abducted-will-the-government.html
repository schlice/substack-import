**If the president gets abducted, will the government be ready to pay
ransom to get him released?**

No.

The government does not pay ransom to terrorists.

Whether or not the president's family decides to pay a ransom is up to
them, preferably while working in conjunction with the State Department
(if the terrorists are foreign) or the FBI (if the terrorists are
domestic).

But "the government" will not pay a ransom to release the president. The
25th Amendment will be invoked and the Vice President will become Acting
President until such time as the President can resume his duties.
