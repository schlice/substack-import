**Content:** [*If I get a medical diagnosis for this condition, does the
law offer me the same protections against discrimination as those set
out for people one the autism spectrum?*\
\
Yes. Employers must provide reasonable accommodations to anyone with a
medically-recognized disability.\
\
*Do I have the right to ask for a low-sensory work environment, barring
noise that is inherent to the job itself?*\
\
You have the right to ask, but that doesn\'t mean that the business will
comply 100% of the time. Whether or not you can get accommodations
depends on whether or not the accommodations are \"reasonable.\"
Reasonableness is determined by whether or not the accommodation will
make a material difference in the way that the business is run, or would
create an undue hardship on the business.\
\
Several items are reviewed to see if an accommodation is not
reasonable:\
\
]{.rendered_qtext}

- the nature and cost of the accommodation needed;
- the overall financial resources of the facility making the reasonable
  accommodation; the number of persons employed at this facility; the
  effect on expenses and resources of the facility;
- the overall financial resources, size, number of employees, and type
  and location of facilities of the employer (if the facility involved
  in the reasonable accommodation is part of a larger entity);
- the type of operation of the employer, including the structure and
  functions of the workforce, the geographic separateness, and the
  administrative or fiscal relationship of the facility involved in
  making the accommodation to the employer;
- the impact of the accommodation on the operation of the facility.
  \[1\]\

For example, if your workstation can be located in a low-sensory area of
the building without a tremendous expense, then that would be an
accommodation that would be considered \"reasonable.\" If the business
had to build you a special low-sensory room to work in, depending on the
cost of such a construction and the gross revenue of the business, that
may not be considered \"reasonable.\" If the accommodation substantially
impacts the business and/or changes the way they do business, it may not
be considered reasonable.\
