Why would you think that God put fossils in the ground?

Young Earth Creationists generally believe that the fossil record was
primarily formed by the global catastrophic Flood of Noah, rather than
God creating fossils directly in the ground as part of a long geological
process. They interpret the sudden appearance of fossils and their
distribution as evidence for a rapid, catastrophic burial event
consistent with Noah\'s Flood, which they believe occurred thousands of
years ago.
