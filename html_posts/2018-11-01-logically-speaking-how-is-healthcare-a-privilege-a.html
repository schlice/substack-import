Hi [[Jaime

thanks for the A2A, not sure I can reasonably contribute more than what
you've already heard here.

But if you read all of these answers, you'll see the same theme:
**healthcare is neither a privilege nor a right.** It is an economic
transaction between a patient and a healthcare provider.

Healthcare can never be a right because it requires the efforts of
someone else (a doctor) to realize. If you have a right to healthcare,
then you can get it for free, because no one can force you to pay for
something to which you have a right. In the United States, I have a
right to buy a firearm. No one can force me to pay for the right to buy
a firearm. I have the right. Just as I have the right to free speech; I
can stand on the street corner and say whatever I choose; no one can
force me to pay for the right to speak. I have the right to not have
soldiers quartered in my home. No one can force me to pay to keep
soldiers out of my home.

However, someone must pay for healthcare. Even in countries where you
get "free" healthcare, *someone* is paying. It's probably you, through
your taxes. Therefore, healthcare is always a financial transaction.

And not a cheap one.

Doctors go to school for years to learn their practice, usually taking
out student loans to do so. They must buy expensive malpractice
insurance. They must follow onerous regulations regarding patient
privacy, medical records protections, etc. None of this comes cheap.
Whether you pay for this out of your paycheck (it's withdrawn every
paycheck by your company) and you only see a small copay or coinsurance,
or whether you pay for it out of pocket, you or your employer (usually
both) are indeed paying for your healthcare.

Therefore, healthcare is not a right, and it's not really a privilege
either. It is a business transaction. You go to the doctor, you pay
money (through one form or another), and you receive a service.

Now before the haters jump all over the comments, the United Nations
says that "Free access to healthcare is a human right."

Let's be clear about this: **everyone in this country has free access to
healthcare.**

That's right, every person, by being a person (aka a human right) can
walk into an emergency room anywhere in the United States and be
treated, irrespective of their ability to pay. Every person; man, woman,
child, citizen, non-citizen, illegal alien, **everyone**.

What's important to note is that the human right is to have "free access
to healthcare." That means "unimpeded" access to healthcare (no one here
will stop you from going to the emergency room). It does *not* mean to
have "access to free healthcare" or even "access to affordable
healthcare." If you don't pay, the hospital will do everything in its
power to try to recoup its costs from you. It will send your bills to
collection agencies, it will sue you to garnish your wages or force you
to sell your car or your house, etc. It will even look to see if you
qualify for government reimbursement for healthcare costs, and will
*sign you up for* *those programs* to try to get their money.
Eventually, it will give up and eat the lost revenue, but it tries
really hard to not do that, because it loses money that way.
