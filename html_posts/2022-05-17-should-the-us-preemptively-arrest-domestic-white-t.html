Yes! They should round them all up and charge them with "Potentially
Being Domestic Terrorists" which is totally a crime.

You know what? There's going to be so many of them, perhaps we can build
a place to house them all, because there won't be any room in the jails.

Those places look lovely, don't they? Those are the internment camps we
built during World War II, when we *preemptively* arrested all those of
Japanese ancestry.

No civil rights violations there, right?

There was a lot of sarcasm in that last section of my answer.

The real answer is that you can't preemptively arrest anyone in the
United States. You're not a criminal until you are. It's that simple.
American citizens have rights.

Now, if you're looking for an answer to why crazy people do crazy things
and what we do about that, then ask that question. But preemptively
arresting people is not the right answer in the United States.
