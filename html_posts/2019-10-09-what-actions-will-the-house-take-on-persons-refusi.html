**What actions will the House take on persons refusing to testify?**

Behind closed doors, they've been talking about having the
Sergeant-at-Arms detain people who violate subcommittee subpoenas. But
this seems a little far-fetched, even for them.

Ultimately, they will attempt to hold individuals who defy subpoenas in
contempt of Congress.

This really means nothing unless they attempt to enforce those
subpoenas, usually through the DOJ and the US Attorney's Office
(normally, the office in DC is the one used for this sort of
enforcement).

It's at this point that they will start to face some of the legal
challenges that this issue is certain to bring, starting with the fact
that the legitimacy of the subpoenas is questionable at best, and at
worst, is rife with legal deficiencies.

If the subpoenas are not legally enforceable because the underlying
investigation is unconstitutional, the US Attorney's Office will be
unable to pursue any enforcement of the subpoenas.

At the very least, issuance of subpoenas, being held in contempt of
Congress and attempted enforcement actions will bring the question of
the legality of the whole "subpoena about impeachment" issue to the
fore. And to the courts, where those questions of law will be decided.
