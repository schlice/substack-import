**Content:** [America.\
\
Almost universally, Americans *live* here, but have never really *seen*
it all, or even most of it. It\'s a sad state of affairs.\
\
I see it in my own life, too. I\'ve lived in Colorado Springs for almost
25 years, have lived at the foot of Pike\'s Peak for nearly the whole
time, and I have never been to the top. There\'s a road, and a Cog
Railway that can take you up. It\'s even paved. There\'s a Summit House
with really good donuts. But I\'ve never been there.\
\
It\'s a beautiful place, this \"America.\" We should visit it
sometime.]{.rendered_qtext}
