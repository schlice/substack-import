It's simple.

The only way we can ensure the protection of the human rights of the
people of Gaza is to **destroy Hamas.**

Hamas is the greatest threat to the protection of human rights in Gaza.

- Hamas digs up pipes used to deliver clean water to the people of Gaza
  and uses sections of that pipe to create rockets.
- Hamas takes aid destined for the people of Gaza and uses it to feed
  their own troops.
- Hamas steals medical supplies from international sources bound for the
  people of Gaza and gives it to their terrorists. We know because we've
  found the international medical supplies on the dead bodies of
  terrorists.
- Hamas forcibly puts rocket launchers in Gazan homes.
- Hamas builds military command centers underneath hospitals.
- Hamas uses Gazan civilians as human shields.

The *only way* to ensure the protection of the human rights of the
people of Gaza is to **destroy Hamas.**
