**Has anyone done a root cause analysis on mass shootings?**

No, because each shooting is different, it would be pointless to RCA all
mass shootings.

If the shooters all belonged to a country, a faction, or a group, then
RCA might be warranted. But shooters are all individual citizens, and
they all have different motivations.

You might be able to RCA each individual shooting, which Federal, state,
and local law enforcement do for each individual incident. You can
probably look up the results of that RCA by searching for details for
the individual incident you're curious about.

But there is no one cause for all mass shootings.
