First, I don\'t know what you mean by \"banning\" Apple. You mean
banning them from selling anything in the United States? I can\'t see
that happening.

***If*** Apple refuses to comply with the order or states that they
physically cannot bypass security without wiping the phone, and ***if***
the court finds that Apple can do such a thing (I have no idea how the
court would find thusly, but hey, it\'s my hypothetical), they could
find Apple in contempt of court and fine the company. There could be
other legal consequences.

However, I suspect that Apple will state that regardless of what other
execs may have said, it is technically infeasible to do what it is that
the government is asking, and they will have to leave it there.

It\'s unfortunate that Tim Cook had to stir up such a brouhaha over
nothing, but I think it will just come down to Apple saying, \"we can\'t
do it.\"
