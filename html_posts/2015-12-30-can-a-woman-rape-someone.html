Depending on the jurisdiction, as some jurisdictions still have
antiquated laws which specify that the aggressor in a rape is male. A
woman attacking a man would be considered \"sexual assault\" in such a
jurisdiction.

Most jurisdictions have moved past this, and categorized rape based on
the unwanted sexual act, not the gender of the aggressor.

Additionally, male arousal is a biological function, not a conscious
decision. Many men can will against it, but it's not easy.

Knowing that arousal as a subconscious biological response to stimuli,
it is most certainly not considered consent.
