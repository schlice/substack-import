**Who told you that you suffer from an autoimmune disease MS?**

So my journey to determine that I had an autoimmune disease went this
way:

I had a bout of optic neuritis. My **ophthalmologist** (wow, I spelled
that right the first time), who did a study on this in the 80s, told me
than in 50% of patients, idiopathic optic neuritis has no cause, and in
the other 50%, it is caused by MS. He then told me I should return to my
**primary care physician** to request an MRI of the brain to check for
signs of MS.

I did this, and my doctor called me back and told me I should find a
good **neurologist** because my MRI (as read by the **radiologist**)
showed all the signs of someone with MS.

I made an appointment with the MS center and saw a **neurologist** who
confirmed that my history, my test results, and my physical neurological
exam all pointed to the fact that I have MS.

I know what you're thinking (plus, I read your profile). *In that whole
list of doctors, there's no immunologist (or more specifically,
rheumatologist, who deals with autoimmune conditions) in that list of
doctors. Why would a neurologist handle an autoimmune disorder???*

While it is true that MS is an autoimmune disease, **there is no
biomarker that a rheumatologist can look for in order to diagnose it**.
It can only be diagnosed through **physical exams and diagnostic tests,
such as an MRI. There is no blood test which can diagnose MS**. Since
the physical symptoms are all related specifically to the disease's
effects on the Central Nervous System (CNS), and the treatment focuses
around those symptoms, the most appropriate medical discipline to manage
multiple sclerosis is the **neurologist**.

So I had a quorum of medical professionals who each added to the body of
evidence needed to reach the diagnosis of MS: an ophthalmologist, a
primary care physician, a neurologist, and a radiologist.

More specifically, rheumatologists primarily deal with autoimmune
diseases which affect the musculoskeletal system directly, such as
rheumatoid arthritis, Lupus, and Sj”ßgren's syndrome. Immunologists,
while specializing in diseases affecting the immune system, don't
routinely handle MS, as they are more focused on allergies and immune
responses to them, including primary immunodeficiency disorders. MS is
an "immune-mediated inflammatory disease," which means that the primary
etiology of the disease is unknown, but we know its effects:
inflammation of nerve fibers. This primary symptom (which causes the
secondary symptoms which characterize the disease) are best treated by a
neurologist. MS is not an "immunodeficiency" which would be treated by
an immunologist. It is an autoimmune disease primarily affecting the
CNS. To that end, it does not squarely fall in the bucket of either the
rheumatologist or the immunologist.
