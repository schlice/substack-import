*The opposition regularly calls explicitly and implicitly for the
military to remove Sanders.*

The military works for the president, as he is the commander in chief.
Military members learn quickly that you can respect the *office* without
respecting the *person*. Calls for stupid things happen all the time
from Congress (i.e. calls to impeach Trump with zero evidence). People
just expect it now..

*Airports are closed, highways are blocked, and bridges are barricaded.
Amid this turmoil the calls for the military to restore order increase*.

Again, it\'s not going to have any effect on the military. The military
works for the people, as all military leaders are civilians. At the head
of every military chain is not a general, but a civilian. This ensures
that the military will always answer to the people. *But what if the
people want to remove the president by force?* Again, the military will
follow the Constitution even more closely than the politicians, and will
not actively violate it. All military members are empowered to disobey
an order which violates the Constitution. The military is very aware of
the Posse Comitatus Act, the Insurrection Act, and the Habeas Corpus
clause, which together prevent the military from interfering in civilian
law enforcement. Unless you have a wholesale rejection of the
Constitution (which is extremely unlikely), the military won\'t actively
violate it.

The way this is handled is through the state militia, also known as the
National Guard. If the fully constituted forces of the National Guard
can\'t handle an uprising, the governor can call for assistance from the
military. Their rules of engagement would make them accountable to the
governor only to quell an insurrection and restore order, and then they
are done.

What makes the US different from anywhere else is the premise of
individual accountability. No longer can you say, "I was just following
orders." That dog won\'t hunt any more. You are accountable for your own
actions and you suffer your own consequences, more so than anywhere
else.

It\'s a culture thing. If you're not from here, you wouldn\'t
understand.
