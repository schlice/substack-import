Well you know, as with all things God (oh sorry, I mean Trump) does,
there is an ultimate purpose that you or I cannot see or comprehend. So
there is a reason God (oh sorry, I did it again, I mean Trump) made it
rain on the Daytona 500.

Now, I have it on good authority (but I'm not telling you where) that if
he didn't stop the race, there was going to be a massive crash and a
driver was going to be killed, so he was actually saving that driver's
life. But don't tell anyone I told you.

***NOTE: For the low-information readers, this entire answer was
sarcasm. Millions of MAGA faithful. I just love this stuff!***

***SECOND NOTE: If you don't know what sarcasm is, and you actually
believe that Trump is God, or if you actually believe that millions of
people believe Trump is God, throw away your cell phone and your
computer right now, you don't belong on the Internet. You can have a
flip phone from the 90s, but that's it.***
