The reason why you don't like the phrase is because you know definitions
of words. You can understand that people don't have *individual truths*.

What you're seeing is the assault by today's society on the concept of
truth. The ideas of "pluralism" and "tolerance" are a direct result of
that assault.

Truth is universal. Truth is undeniable. Truth is unchanging. Absolute
truth exists, and we can know it.

There is no such thing as "my truth" and "your truth." There is only
***one truth.*** The Law of Noncontradiction says very clearly that
something is either true, or it is not true. There is no third choice.

Here's a few other facts about truth:

- Truth is *discovered*, not *invented*. Gravity existed before the
  apple fell on Newton's head.
- Truth is *transcultural and timeless*. It is true for all people at
  all times in all places. 1+1=2 for all people everywhere, and has been
  true for all of history.
- Truth is *unchanging*, **even though our beliefs about truth may
  change**. The orbits of the planets did not change after we began to
  believe that the sun was the center of the solar system instead of the
  earth. The orbits did not change, only our *belief* about the orbits
  changed.
  - And as a corollary to that last point, belief does not change facts,
    regardless of how sincere you are in your belief. I may sincerely
    believe that the earth is the center of the universe, but that just
    makes me sincerely mistaken.

TL;DR: Contrary *beliefs* are possible, but contrary *truths* are not.
We can *believe* that everything is true, but that doesn't *make*
everything true. We can *believe* that people have their own individual
truths, but that doesn't *make* all of them true.

So "speak your belief." Don't "speak your truth," because there is no
such thing as "your truth."

Original question:

I can't stand the phrase "speak my truth", can you give suggestions for
anything else we can say for that concept?
