**Is it a HIPAA violation to have a video camera in a private treatment
room? There are video cameras in every private room and the main gyms.
This is a physical, speech, & occupational therapist office.**

As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."

First of all, there are certain areas known as "common sense private
areas" where cameras can never be installed. These include areas like
locker rooms, bathrooms, changing rooms, and any other area where people
have a reasonable expectation of privacy.

Medical facilities need to understand that video cameras *may* be
permitted, so long as doctors get permission to record their patients,
patients have the option to "opt-out" of recording, and any recording is
treated exactly as any other protected health information (PHI) that the
doctor's office maintains. Basically, any video/audio recordings inside
private rooms must be disclosed, the patient must "opt-in" to such
recordings, and if they do, the recordings must be treated like any
other PHI that the doctor's office maintains. The patient must be given
the opportunity to review any recordings and request corrections. All
HIPAA rules must be followed when dealing with video, just like with
other protected medical records.

There may also be state law which governs whether or not cameras can be
installed in private offices, and those vary by state.

Even the cameras in the main gyms may record PHI, so the recordings must
be treated similarly regardless of where they are. If there is a chance
that they could record PHI, HIPAA rules apply to the recordings.
