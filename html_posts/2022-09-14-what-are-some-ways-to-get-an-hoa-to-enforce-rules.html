Short answer: you don't. The HOA is free to enforce some rules and not
enforce others. So long as they enforce equally, they can *not* enforce
a particular rule and that's perfectly legal. Most Covenants contain a
statement that says that the Association ***may*** enforce the
provisions of the covenants. That word "may" is a legal term which does
not require action. That word would be "shall." The word "may" means
that the Board has enforcement discretion. Check your Governing
Documents to see what your Board needs to do in any one case.

Our docs also state that an owner may "bring an action for specific
performance, declaratory decree or injunction." This means that you can
sue the Board in order to force them to enforce the provisions.

So the only way you can "force" the Board to enforce the rules is to sue
the Board. Otherwise, in most cases, the Board is under no obligation to
enforce any one specific rule. However, this is all dependent solely on
what your HOA's Governing Documents say, as well as prevailing state
law, so you must always check those to see what your Board must do and
what they are not legally compelled to do.
