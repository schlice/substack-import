This is an involved answer, so let me take it a piece at a time.

**Who are the voting members in a Lake Association?**

That depends on the particular association. A Lake Association is simply
a group of people who work together for a common goal, in this case, the
preservation and enjoyment of a lake. There are various types of lake
associations:

- *HOAs*. Some lake associations are centered around the homeowners who
  surround the lake. These groups tend to be focused on property value
  more than preservation of the lake.
- *Watershed Groups.* These groups usually include governmental
  agencies, along with private industries, drinking water agencies, and
  wastewater facilities. These types of groups tend to focus on
  governmental compliance.
- *"Friends" Groups.* These groups tend to be fairly diverse,
  grassroots, and smaller than the other types of lake associations.
  They usually focus on education and conservation.

As you can see, the membership in lake associations tends to be all over
the map, depending on the type of lake association you have.

How the association conducts voting, and who is eligible to vote, is a
matter of public record, and can be found in the association's Bylaws.

**Are all the households entitled to be in the lake association eligible
or only the paid, currently participating members?**

How any one type of lake association is organized, and what benefits
each entity gets, is all dependent on the association itself. You will
have to refer back to the Governing Documents of the association to get
specific answers as to how your particular lake association is run.
