No, because Jesus (God) did raise Himself (Jesus) from the dead. That's
precisely what happened. Jesus is God. God is God. The Holy Spirit is
God. But God the Father is not God the Son. God the Spirit is not God
the Father. God the Spirit is not God the Son. God the Father raised God
the Son from the dead. Are you confused yet?

Mixing terms for God won't damn you to hell. *Misunderstanding the
Trinity* won't condemn you to hell. *Not believing that God paid the
penalty for our sin will.*

The simple fact of the matter is that God took the punishment on Himself
that we deserve. We are sinners. We deserve hell. There is no question
about it. And there is nothing we can do, ourselves, under our own
power, to buy our way into heaven. But instead of allowing us to take
the punishment for our sin, He took the punishment we deserve onto
Himself. His shed blood on the cross washes our sins clean. His
resurrection defeated death. He paved the way so we could go to Heaven,
and all we have to do is make the choice to believe in Him.
