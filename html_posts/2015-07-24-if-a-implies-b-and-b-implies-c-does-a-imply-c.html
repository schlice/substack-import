**Content:** [In logic, this is correct.\
\
A \--\> B\
B \--\> C\
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\
therefore, A \--\> C\
\
This is **valid logic**. For example:\
\
Joe has gray hair.\
Gray hair looks old.\
Therefore, Joe looks old.\
\
The inverse is **fallacious logic:**\
\
A \--\> C\
B \--\> C\
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\
therefore A \--\> B\
\
Example:\
\
Joe has gray hair.\
My dog has gray hair.\
Therefore, Joe is a dog.\

An example of fallacious logic on Quora:\

[[Since most pro-lifers tend to be pro-gun supporters, why don\'t they
use the same logic that, \"Guns don\'t kill people. People kill
people.\" to also \"Abortions don\'t kill people. People kill
people.\"?](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-people-who-consider-themselves-pro-life-not-support-gun-control/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container}]{.rendered_qtext}
