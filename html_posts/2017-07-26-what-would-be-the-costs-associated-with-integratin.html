There are some fairly significant costs, which cannot be overlooked.
Additionally, you must view all of these costs as necessary ***only***
if the cost can be justified against the mission and vision of the US
military, which is to be the greatest fighting force on the face of the
planet. Therefore, any expenditure must, in some way, further that goal.
In other words, it must increase troop readiness, efficiency, or
provide/enhance the tools or training they need to do their jobs.

Also, I can provide the source for all of these numbers, but to see how
they were determined would require a post of its own. The numbers used
were all from pro-LGBT sources. And while some estimates for the amount
of people who might seek surgery are lower, those estimates are based on
covering the cost individually; it is assumed that if the military
covered the cost, more eligible people would seek that surgery.

First, the military would be on the hook for gender reassignment
surgery, if a trans person chose to receive such surgery. They would
then be required to pay for hormone replacement therapy, as well as lost
time for recovery. Finally, there is the "real life experience" cost to
the military, which many dollar estimates fail to account for:

In short, this means that a trans person will have to spend a minimum of
one year in an off-duty status, away from the duty station, which also
means you have a military member in a non-deployable, non-functional
status for a year. Next to the actual surgery, this is a huge cost to
our military readiness.

It is estimated that such surgeries and all associated costs, for every
trans military troop that wanted them, incoming or existing, would use
**\$3.7 billion** over 10 years from the military's already tight
budget. In context, that money could buy a Navy destroyer, 22 F-35 Joint
Strike Fighter aircraft, 3,700 Tomahawk missiles, or 116 Chinook
helicopters.

In the latest round of defense funding requests, Congress requested an
extra \$80 billion. Shouldn't we at least question whether or not we
spend almost 5% of that money on gender reassignment surgeries and all
associated personnel and medical costs, when they do not further the
mission of the military?

And I forgot to add (and I'd better, before the trolls show up): I don't
care if you're trans. I don't care if you have gender reassignment
surgery. What you do in your own life is your own business. The
***ONLY*** thing I care about is whether or not I think the US military
should *pay* for your gender reassignment surgery, and whether or not
the cost of having a military member sidelined for a year while they
participate in their 12-month real-life experience leave is a benefit to
the US military; in other words, does it benefit troop readiness, does
it make for a stronger fighting force, does it make us fight better?

And here's another thing to consider (and again, I mean no offense
against trans people, but since the point was made while these numbers
were being computed, it's worth addressing): Since there is a portion of
the trans population who has not undergone gender reassignment surgery
because of the cost, is there then a non-significant number of trans
people who would join the military simply to have them pay for surgery?
To be fair, there are people who join the military without having
"serving their country" as their primary objective. Some join because
they want the education benefits. Some join because they think it will
"give" them discipline, when they have none in their life already. These
people are indeed the exception rather than the rule. It's not
insensitive to ask the question if it's right to add yet another
exception to that rule.
