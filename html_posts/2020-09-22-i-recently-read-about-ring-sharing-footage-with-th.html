**I recently read about Ring sharing footage with the police. Do Blink
cameras (owned by Amazon) also share footage with law enforcement?**

Ring started its "Neighbors" app to help combat crime in neighborhoods.
Ring also partnered with over 400 law enforcement agencies, allowing
them to request video clips from Ring users who have opted in to the
program. Ring users must consent to share the clips with law
enforcement; law enforcement does not have unfettered access to your
Ring camera or any clips without end user consent.

To the best of my knowledge, Blink (owned by Amazon) has not entered
into any partnerships with law enforcement, nor do they have a network
like the Ring "Neighbors" network.
