**If a staff member obtained evidence of their dismissal being wrongful
by illegally hacking the companies files, would the evidence be
admissible in court? If not why not punish the hacking crime separately
instead of forbidding the evidence?**

As long as the "staff member" is not the government, then usually the
evidence is admissible.

The "fruit of the poisonous tree" doctrine is an extension of the
Exclusionary Rule. This rule was established in *Mapp v. Ohio* in 1961.
Basically, the Exclusionary Rule prevents the government from using most
evidence gathered in violation of the Constitution. If evidence was
located that falls within the scope of the rule, and this evidence leads
the government to more evidence, which they would not have found
otherwise, this new evidence is excluded. This "new evidence" is called
"fruit of the poisonous tree."

There are certain situations in which the new evidence is not excluded:

- If the illegally obtained evidence could be obtained legally by some
  other means
- *Inevitable discovery,* if the evidence would have eventually been
  legally discovered (other than by obtaining a search warrant)
- *Attenuation of the taint*, if the "taint" (the illegal procurement of
  evidence) becomes so "attenuated" from the eventual discovery of that
  evidence that it serves no legitimate purpose to suppress it.

It is also well known that the exclusionary rule is only binding on the
government (i.e. the police and/or the prosecuting attorney). If the
police receive unsolicited evidence of a crime, but that evidence was
obtained illegally, the police are still allowed to use that evidence.

**TL;DR:** As long as the police or the government didn't request that
evidence, or request you hack anything to get it, it can usually be
used, even if it was illegally obtained.
