**Is it a good idea that the US Air Force and possibly other service
branches are looking to change or revolutionize how they train pilots?**

It's always a good idea that the services continually review their
training programs and update, modernize, or phase them out depending on
the needs of the service.

We also have to consider that the air mission will continue to evolve.
UAVs will continue to gain prominence, and we will need a different
breed of pilot to run them. We simply cannot effectively train pilots
the "same old way" when the platforms and the mission are changing
underneath them.

We are actually actively investigating new preliminary flight training
programs right now. These new programs incorporate VR headsets, allowing
student pilots to "chair fly" far more effectively. The Air Force
estimates that we can reduce about 60% of preliminary flight training
hours by using the headsets to replace that introductory instruction.
That's money saved on aircraft costs, better utilization of instructors,
and more fulfilling and relevant instruction for students.
