13 states have "trigger laws" which won't go into effect unless *Roe* is
actually overturned.

10 states already have laws banning abortions on their books, but since
*Roe* and its follow-on cases, those laws have been unenforceable. If
*Roe* remains, those laws will remain unenforceable.

In the short term, the case which spurred this on, *Dobbs,* will be
decided, and the Mississippi law banning abortions after 15 weeks will
be found to be unconstitutional under *Roe*.

The other states which have laws banning abortions after 15 weeks (like
Florida and Texas) will see those laws similarly overturned as
unconstitutional.

Original question:

If the Supreme Court decides to leave Roe v. Wade untouched, how will
that affect the states' new abortion laws?
