**Content:** [There will be increased costs based on the fact that the
entire department will have been \"called out\"; basically, all officers
are working 12-hour shifts non-stop, because not only do they have to
deal with the riots, they still have to perform their daily tasks of
patrol, working in the jail, etc. Calls for service still have to be
answered.]{.rendered_qtext}
