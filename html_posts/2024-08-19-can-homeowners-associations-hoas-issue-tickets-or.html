Apologies for some of the incorrect answers, but this question is
frequently misunderstood.

If your Governing Documents say that you cannot park on the public
street within the HOA's area of responsibility, you cannot park on the
street. If the HOA catches you, they can issue warning letters and fines
according to the procedures spelled out in their Governing Documents, in
just the same way that they address any violation of the rules. They can
proceed with additional enforcement actions if you refuse to pay your
fines.

What they cannot do is **tow or boot** cars which are parked in
violation of their Governing Documents.

Every neighborhood I lived in had such a rule.

In my neighborhood in Colorado, it was strictly enforced. Of course, we
knew who owned what cars, so it was easy to enforce. The majority of the
homeowners wanted the rule, as it kept the neighborhood not only safe
but neat and tidy.

My Florida neighborhood had much more narrow streets, but they also had
County-placed "No Parking" signs on one side of the street, because of
how narrow the streets were. So while we had the rule in our Governing
Documents, **we never enforced it**. Despite some people's confusion
over "selective enforcement," not enforcing a rule is not selective
enforcement. Selective enforcement is when I apply a rule to one person
but not apply the same rule to someone else for the same infraction. If
we as a Board decide to not enforce a rule in our Governing Documents,
we have that authority. If the voters don't like it, they can elect
someone else who will enforce that rule, but we never had an issue. We
allowed single side of the street parking, referred any parking issues
on the No Parking side of the street to the County sheriff's office, and
everything worked out well.

It's important to note the difference between public streets in a HOA,
and ***private*** streets inside of a gated HOA. When you have a gated
HOA, the streets are owned by the HOA. The HOA can ticket drivers, they
can issue fines, and they can tow and/or boot cars which are parked in
violation of the rules.
