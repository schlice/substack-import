**Content:** [A2A\
\
As with most systems created by people, the actual judicial system
itself has few flaws in its construction. \"On paper,\" therefore, the
system should work nearly flawlessly.\
\
The *execution* of the system is always flawed, because the system is
made up of more than just laws that dictate its construction. Because
there are *people* as part of the system, the system is, inherently,
flawed.]{.rendered_qtext}
