This is one of those times that Google is your friend. A quick perusal
of Google brings up this gem of an article from the History Channel:

> The idea that a just and fair government must divide power between
> various branches did not originate at the Constitutional Convention,
> but has deep philosophical and historical roots.
>
> In his analysis of the government of Ancient Rome, the Greek statesman
> and historian Polybius identified it as a "mixed" regime with three
> branches: monarchy (the consul, or chief magistrate), aristocracy (the
> Senate) and democracy (the people). These concepts greatly influenced
> later ideas about separation of powers being crucial to a
> well-functioning government.
>
> Centuries later, the Enlightenment philosopher Baron de Montesquieu
> wrote of despotism as the primary threat in any government. In his
> famous work "The Spirit of the Laws," Montesquieu argued that the best
> way to prevent this was through a separation of powers, in which
> different bodies of government exercised legislative, executive and
> judicial power, with all these bodies subject to the rule of law.
>
> Building on the ideas of Polybius, Montesquieu, William Blackstone,
> John Locke and other philosophers and political scientists over the
> centuries, the framers of the U.S. Constitution divided the powers and
> responsibilities of the new federal government among three branches:
> the legislative branch, the executive branch and the judicial branch.
>
> In addition to this separation of powers, the framers built a system
> of checks and balances designed to guard against tyranny by ensuring
> that no branch would grab too much power.
>
> "If men were angels, no government would be necessary," James Madison
> wrote in the Federalist Papers, of the necessity for checks and
> balances. "In framing a government which is to be administered by men
> over men, the great difficulty is this: You must first enable the
> government to control the governed; and in the next place, oblige it
> to control itself."[\[1\]](#jHnJg){#cite-jHnJg .citation_link}
