**Content:** [The \"legal gun owner\" you speak of (the straw purchaser)
is not a legal gun owner.\
\
Yes, technically at the time he makes the purchase, it\'s a legal
purchase. But he\'s doing so for the express purpose of reselling those
guns illegally, so his initial purchase can then be ruled illegal as
well. That, however, is an issue for the courts to deal with.\
\
By the way, there are lots of legal purchases that turn into illegal
guns. What if you buy parts and then assemble them and sell that
now-assembled gun illegally? You didn\'t buy a gun, you bought parts.
You then assembled a gun and illegally sold it.\
\
So to answer your question, yes, at one point, all illegal guns started
their lives as legal purchases by someone who chose to illegally resell
that gun. A great majority of those purchases don\'t originate in this
country, either. We can\'t control those. It\'s up to CBP to do a better
job at finding illegal gun parts as they are shipped into the country.\
\
But you then made the fallacious logical leap that \"legal gun owners\"
are responsible for all illegal guns, which is a logical conclusion that
you cannot draw. As I said, a straw purchaser is not a legal gun owner.
A legal gun owner buys guns that he will use legally. Straw purchasers,
while making legal purchases, intend to use their guns illegally
(illegal sales), so they are not \"legal gun owners.\" So your logic is
incorrect.]{.rendered_qtext}
