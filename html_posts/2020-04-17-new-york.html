**New York\'s governor just signed an executive order requiring everyone
to wear a face covering. Why did this come so late?**

*What leads you to believe that this is late?*

The state was already under a mandatory stay-at-home order, so mandatory
face coverings were largely unnecessary, as most non-essential
businesses were closed anyway. The governor is now trying to set the
conditions under which he can start advising people to go back to work
and re-open the state. He has decided that everyone wearing face
coverings in public is a start. It's such a good start, that he's doing
it now for everyone. If we can't slow the spread with social distancing
only, we'll help slow the spread by mandating face coverings.
