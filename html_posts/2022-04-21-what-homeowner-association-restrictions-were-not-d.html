Here's a good one:

In Florida, if you buy a home which is part of a Homeowner's
Association, the **buyer** is responsible for ensuring that the home
meets all of the HOA's ongoing architectural approvals, and if it does
not, the **buyer** becomes responsible for anything unapproved by the
HOA when they take ownership.

I have always thought this was a patently ridiculous idea. The HOA is
under no obligation to tell a prospective buyer what is wrong with a
given property, and there isn't a mechanism for a buyer to get an
inspection of a home by the HOA before they buy it. But they become
liable for it once they buy it. The buyer, for his part, would have to
learn the entire Architectural Approval guidelines before they buy, and
that just seems unreasonable to me.
