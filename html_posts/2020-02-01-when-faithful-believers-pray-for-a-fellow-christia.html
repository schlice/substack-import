So in essence, you are asking if prayer is even worth it, because
sometimes we don\'t get what we asked for, is that it?

Have you ever asked for something as a child that you didn\'t get?
Perhaps a special toy, or a certain food. Why didn\'t you get that
thing? In most cases, it was because your parent determined that you
would ultimately be better off without it, or maybe because they were
saving that money for something else, or maybe because it wasn\'t as
great as you thought it was. In any case, someone with more knowledge,
wisdom and foresight, made a decision on your behalf, despite your
insistence that you really wanted it and that it would definitely
enhance your life.

While an imperfect analogy, it\'s close enough for our purposes.

We do not know what God has planned for us. We do not know what God has
planned for any of us. We don\'t know how His choices fit into His plan.
We may never know during this lifetime. Only when we see Him face to
face will we ever get a small glimpse of how all the pieces for
together. But now? We simply don\'t know.

What we do know for sure is that He has promised that our lives will be
used to further His kingdom and to bring others in as well. He has
promised that we will be with Him. And we know that he has always kept
His promises, despite our inability to see the big picture.

So we may ask for healing, but we do so by saying *if it is your will,
heal this person.* And that\'s the key. It may not be His will that this
person is healed.

Prayer is not like a vending machine, where you put the money in and you
get your desired product. Prayer is a pleading of the heart, a heart He
already knows. He knows your pain, and he feels it as acutely as you do.

But He has plans for you. He has plans for all of us. Faith, therefore,
is our ability to trust that He has a plan, and that He will keep His
promises.
