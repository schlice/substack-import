*If* he is convicted of indecent exposure (which is seems likely that he
will be), he will be required to register on the sex offender registry.

*Will* he be? That\'s up to the court to decide. Where I live, indecent
exposure involves exposure of the genitals **with the intent** \"to
arouse or to satisfy the sexual desires of anyone.\" The \"anyone\"
could be himself, a known viewer, or an unknown viewer. Our law is
written with an intent clause. Here, it would be up to the prosecution
to prove that there was intent to cause sexual arousal.

However, the defendant is in Arizona. There, indecent exposure is listed
as: \"Intentionally exposing your private parts (genitals or anus, or a
female exposing the areola or nipple of her breast) and another person
is present. The defendant must be reckless about the fact that the other
person may be offended.\"

This young man\'s conduct clearly meets this standard. The fact remains
that no one caught the offensive picture and it was published. He was
reckless in allowing the picture to be taken and to be used. He made no
effort to inform anyone of his prank and allowed the picture to be used,
which was reckless. Under Arizona law, this would be considered indecent
exposure.
