"Screen tests," of the variety indicated by the article, are very
uncommon today. Not only is there video in the back of the car in many
jurisdictions, but officers in almost all jurisdictions are required to
seat belt rear seat occupants in. Performing a screen test would be an
indication that the officer failed to follow procedure and properly seat
belt his passenger. Arriving at the jail with injuries like that are a
big red flag that the officer didn\'t follow correct transport
procedure.

So unless he is looking to get himself in trouble, that\'s not going to
happen.
