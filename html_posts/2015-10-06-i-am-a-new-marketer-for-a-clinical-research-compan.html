**Content:** [I can speak to the Multiple Sclerosis side.\
\
Our regional Multiple Sclerosis center publicizes research trials all
the time, mostly the ones they are doing themselves, but some are from
outside researchers. You might consider reaching out to some of those.\
\
Also, your absolute best bet is to reach out to the [[National MS
Society](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=26e11d&url=http://www.nationalmssociety.org/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container} as their chapters
can publicize information about upcoming drug trials to their clients.
They can also direct you to other locations where you can continue to
spread the word about your trial.]{.rendered_qtext}
