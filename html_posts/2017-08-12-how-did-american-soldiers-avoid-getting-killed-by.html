Moving slowly and methodically, carefully sweeping for IEDs, and taking
the occasional hits in the vehicles designed to take the hits.

I would strongly suggest looking up a TV show which ran on G4 called
"Bomb Patrol: Afghanistan". I'm sure you can find reruns or possibly
full episodes online. The description for the show reads:

> *This documentary series, narrated by actor Josh Duhamel, follows an
> eight-man unit from the U.S. Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal,
> otherwise known as EOD, during the unit\'s five-month campaign in
> Afghanistan. The EOD is the world\'s premier combat force for
> countering improvised explosive devices, weapons of mass destruction
> and other types of weaponry. The program highlights all aspects of the
> unit\'s deployment \-- from the life-or-death missions to humorous,
> lighthearted moments shared by the
> brothers-in-arms.*[\[1\]](#ptvGX){#cite-ptvGX .citation_link}
