**What should you do if a girl falsely accuses you of rape and
everything is against you in today\'s era (Me Too effect)?**

*You fight like Hell.*

You mount a vigorous defense. You saturate the local media and the
social media with evidence of your innocence. You get hundreds of
character witnesses to testify to your upstanding character. You
assemble a crack legal team to aid you in your defense. You set up a
GoFundMe to help fund your legal expenses.

But proving that you *didn't* do something is very difficult. You can't
prove a negative. You can only show what you did do.

And then you hope for the best.

We're headed down a very dangerous path.
