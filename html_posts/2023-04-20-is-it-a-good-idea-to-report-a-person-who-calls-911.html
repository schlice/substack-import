The nice thing about such a person is that they *self-report*.

When you call 911, the police will indeed find out why you called. And
if you make frequent calls with no emergency, you could be charged with
misuse of the 911 system.

In Florida, Misuse of the 911 System is a 1st degree Misdemeanor,
meaning up to one year in jail and up to a \$1,000 fine for the first
four offenses. One example of a Florida Misdemeanor Misuse of 911 case
was a 29-year old Tampa man who called 911 asking the operator for sex.
According to the police report, a man called 911 because he ran out of
minutes on his phone plan, and 911 was the only free number he could
call. He then proceeded to ask the operator about her clothing and her
body parts, making obscene remarks about the operator and about
masturbation. 15 minutes later, the police arrived at his house and
arrested him for misuse of 911. Due to his criminal history, he was
taken to jail and held on a \$1,500 bond.

At the fifth offense, the crime is increased to a 3rd degree Felony,
carrying a jail term of up to five years and a fine of up to \$5,000.
One example of a Florida Felony Misuse of 911 case is a man who called
the Manatee County Sheriff's Office 18 times over a period of two
months. His calls were all made to accuse a Deputy Sheriff who lived in
his neighborhood of allegedly making out with a prostitute who lived
across the street from him. Since the number of calls exceeded four, he
was charged with Felony Misuse of 911 and taken to jail.
