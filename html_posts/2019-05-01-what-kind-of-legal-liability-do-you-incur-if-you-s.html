**What kind of legal liability do you incur if you shoot an active
shooter stopping a massacre?**

There is a saying in the pro-gun world. "Every bullet you fire has a
lawyer attached to it." So to broadly answer your question, every bullet
you fire puts you at risk of facing legal action.

Interestingly, you face *less* scrutiny as a civilian than you would as
a police officer. Police officers who fire in the line of duty are
subject to more investigations than civilians.

You could potentially face both criminal charges, as well as civil
charges.

Criminally, you could be charged with murder or any of its lesser
included offenses, such as manslaughter, or criminally negligent
homicide. You would argue (if you were even charged with a criminal
offense) that you acted in self-defense (defense of others is also
self-defense).

Civilly, the family of the shooter can sue for wrongful death. While
they can prove that your actions were the proximate cause of the death,
your affirmative defense would be the same (that you acted in
self-defense to save your own life and the lives of others).
