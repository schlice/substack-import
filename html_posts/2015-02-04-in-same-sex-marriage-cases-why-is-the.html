**Content:** [Because whether or not one state recognizes a gay marriage
from another state is not at issue, unless it is.\
\
The 14th Amendment, or the \"due process\" or \"equal protection\"
clause, is most often cited in marriage cases because the plaintiff is
challenging the marriage laws within a state, saying that according to
the 14th Amendment, the law must be applied equally to all groups of
citizens. It forbids **states** from denying life, liberty, or property
to anyone without due process of law, or denying to any person within
its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. Because of its direct
application to the states, the 14th Amendment is cited in more
Constitutional challenges than any other Amendment in the Constitution.\
\
If the case was that State A did not recognize the legal marriage in
State B, then the case would turn on the \"full faith and credit\"
clause.]{.rendered_qtext}
