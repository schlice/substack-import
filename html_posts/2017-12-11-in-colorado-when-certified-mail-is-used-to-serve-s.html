**In Colorado, when certified mail is used to serve someone with a
traffic ticket, do they have to sign for it to be considered served?
What laws and/or case law govern this matter?**

The only "traffic tickets" which can be served through certified mail
are red light camera violations. Initially, these will come through
regular mail, with an included option on how to waive your rights and
pay the fine.

But here's the trick:

***Before you are served, it's not a violation. And if you don't get a
certified letter, you're still not served.***

There are three ways you can be officially served:

- The citation is handed to you by a police officer or process server
- The citation is left at your home with someone who is 18 years of age
  or older,
- The citation is mailed to you as a certified letter, return receipt
  requested.

Colorado Revised Statute 42-4-110.5 requires that, in the case of a
traffic violation detected by an "automatic vehicle identification
system" (like a traffic camera), the city must "serve the penalty
assessment notice or summons and complaint for the alleged violation on
the defendant no later than ninety days after the alleged violation
occurred." [[There have been
reports](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=22959a&url=http://kdvr.com/2017/09/13/drivers-can-legally-avoid-paying-red-light-camera-citations-in-colorado/){.external_link

at 6 am in some cases, so be aware of that.

The second notice could come as a certified letter.

If you don't sign for the letter within 90 days of the alleged offense,
the fine is no longer valid. **But if you do sign for the letter, you've
been served,** and you are expected to pay. Failing to pay would subject
you to civil punishments, not criminal (i.e. it will never add points to
your driving record). You could get a negative hit on your credit, and
your delinquent payment would be sent to a collection agency.
