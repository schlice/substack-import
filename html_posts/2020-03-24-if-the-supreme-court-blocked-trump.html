**If the Supreme Court blocked Trump\'s Muslim travel ban, would that
have prevented him from having a Coronavirus travel ban?**

Even if they would have blocked his ban on travel from those
majority-Muslim countries, this travel ban is different because it is
health-related, not related to the inability of those majority-Muslim
countries to get us background information on people who wish to enter
the United States in a timely manner.
