This is a classic thought experiment, but most of these answers rest on
a flaw of understanding God's omnipotence.

Most people understand God's omnipotence as "God can do anything." But
actually, omnipotence does not refer to what God can or can't do.
*Omnipotence is a measure of power.*

Power is the ability to effect change, to make something happen. God,
being omnipotent, has unlimited power. But we know that there are some
things which God cannot do. For example, the Bible tells us that God
cannot deny His own nature (cf Hebrews 6:18; 2 Timothy 2:13; Titus 1:2).
The reason He cannot do these things is because of His nature, and the
nature of the universe He created. In other words, **God cannot do
things which, in this universe, are impossible to do,** like creating a
two-sided triangle. This is because true impossibility is not based on
the amount of power used, but on what is actually possible to do. The
truly impossible is not something which can be accomplished by simply
adding more power. *Impossibility,* therefore, means the same thing
whether or not God is involved.

So is it possible for God to create a rock so heavy that even He cannot
lift it? Considering that God has unlimited power, God has unlimited
lifting force. So is it possible, in this universe, for a rock to exist
which is of sufficient (infinite) mass such that God's unlimited lifting
force cannot move it?

The answer is no, but not because God is not omnipotent, but because
such a rock cannot be created. You cannot have an infinitely large rock
in our universe, because material objects cannot be infinite. Our
universe (where matter, time, and space are) is finite, so you cannot
have an infinitely-sized rock in a finite universe.

Therefore, the question is really asking whether or not God can make a
**contradiction**, which He cannot.
