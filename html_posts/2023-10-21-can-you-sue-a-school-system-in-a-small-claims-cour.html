In the United States, you can sue anyone for anything. The question
becomes whether or not you might succeed in your suit.

You can sue a school district for emotional distress. You can sue if the
school district was responsible for victimizing students or staff. You
can also sue if the school district was at fault or did nothing to
prevent emotional and physical injuries.

In most states, you can file a lawsuit against a private school within
two years from the injury\'s date. You can file a lawsuit against a
public school within three years.

Check with a personal injury attorney in your area to assess your
situation to see if you qualify for emotional distress compensation.
