From a cursory review of the law, you have four years to commence a
malicious prosecution claim.

See [[Fl Stat 95.11
(3)(o)](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=55d9f9&url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode%3DDisplay_Statute%26URL%3D0000-0099/0095/Sections/0095.11.html){.external_link

However, there may be other circumstances which may affect your rights.
You need to contact a licensed attorney in your area as soon as you can
to ensure your rights are protected.
