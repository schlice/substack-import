**What do we do after the corrupt conservative controlled Supreme Court
overturns Roe v. Wade?**

Let's pretend for a moment that you aren't using silly adjectives to
describe the court.

If the court overturns Roe, this simply means that abortion is no longer
a Constitutionally-protected right. That's all it means. It means that
they've finally come to their senses and figured out that there is no
"right to privacy" anywhere in the Constitution unless you pass an
Amendment to make it so.

It means that states are not prevented from outlawing abortion within
their state, if the people in that state choose to do so.

So what do you do? Work within your state to pass solid abortion
protection measures. Maybe work to amend your state Constitution to
explicitly allow abortion on demand from conception to birth.

Heck, maybe you even work to pass an Amendment to the Constitution that
grants women the right to abortion, or grants all Americans the right to
privacy which would then make the previous SCOTUS reasoning valid. If
you feel that you have enough support among the states to get it done,
that's probably the ultimate.
