**Content:** [There is actually a **very big difference** between the
Air National Guard and the Air Force Reserve. The difference is not in
the job they do, since they both fly, fight, and win. The difference is
who they work for.\
\
The Air Force Reserve is the Reserve branch for the United States Air
Force. They work for the **Commander-in-Chief**. These reservists are in
different mission categories which allow them to \"drill\" one weekend a
month, and a few weeks over the summer with their active units. There
are some Reserve units that are full-time, which does make things
confusing.\
\
The Air National Guard is actually not a part of the active US Air
Force. The National Guard (all branches) works for the **Governor** of
the state in which they serve. The Air National Guard defends the
residents of that state.\
\
When I was in the USAFR, I was an Individual Mobility Augmentee (IMA),
which means that I filled in for an active-duty billet when that person
was deployed. If the person for whom I was covering were to be deployed,
I would be brought onto temporary active duty to fill that slot full
time until that person returned. This is done in critical-manned billets
that have to have a person filling that slot at all times. I still
trained with my unit, but I would have been brought to active duty had
my billet needed backfill.]{.rendered_qtext}
