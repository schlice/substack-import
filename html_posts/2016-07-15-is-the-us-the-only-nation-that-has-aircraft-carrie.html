Short answer: no.

Detail: The following countries have CATOBAR (Catapult-Assisted Take Off
But Arrested Recovery) aircraft carriers which have offset runways for
both landing and launching simultaneously:

**United States\
Brazil\
France**

Three other countries run STOBAR (Short Take Off But Arrested
Recovery)-style aircraft carriers, and while they cannot launch
simultaneously as some of the flight path overlaps, they can alternate
launch/recovery:

**China\
India\
Russia**[\[1\]](#VxqRb){#cite-VxqRb .citation_link}

Several other countries also have VTOL (Vertical Take Off and Landing)
and STOVL (Short Take Off, Vertical Landing) carriers in service as
well, but since the question asked about simultaneous launches and
landings, I did not include them. Check the Wikipedia link for the full
list of countries and their aircraft carrier types.
