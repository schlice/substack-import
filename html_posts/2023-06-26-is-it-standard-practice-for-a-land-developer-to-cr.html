Generally, no. But it varies by state. What a developer is able to write
into the Declaration of Covenants is absolutely and ultimately
controlled by state law.

In our Covenants in our neighborhood in Florida, the developer remains a
Class B voting member of the Association until such time as the
conditions in state law are met.

Among those conditions in state law is that the developer loses his
membership three months after 90% of the lots have been conveyed to
members.
