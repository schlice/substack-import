**Do all black lives matter? While on the outside BLM appears to be a
social justice organization for the African-American, they also support
the choice to abort African-American babies! Are they not important
black lives?**

*(Prepare yourself for the unpopular, but correct, answer)*

This is the problem when you have an organization whose name is also a
slogan, an idea. You can *conflate* the organization with the slogan.

Like the disingenuous question asked of Johnathan Isaac during one of
the first NBA games played in the Disney World bubble, when he did not
kneel or wear a BLM T-shirt: "We noticed you didn't kneel or wear a BLM
shirt. Do black lives matter?"

He answered, "Absolutely I believe Black lives matter. Kneeling while
wearing a Black Lives Matter T-shirt doesn't go hand in hand with
supporting Black lives. \[...\] I don't think kneeling or putting on a
T-shirt for me personally is the answer. I feel like for me Black lives
are supported through the gospel. All lives are supported through the
gospel. We all have things that we do wrong. Sometimes it gets into a
place of pointing fingers. We all fall short of God's glory. Whoever
will humble themselves and seek God and repent of their sins, we can see
our mistakes and people's mistakes and evil in a different light. Racism
isn't the only thing that plagues our society, our nation, our world."

You can believe in the *slogan* that "Black lives matter" **while
simultaneously believing that the** ***organization*** **Black Lives
Matter does not care about Black lives at all.**

You might think you're supporting an organization that believes in
social justice for Blacks, and on the outside, they do appear that way.
**But you would be wrong.** Black Lives Matter, the organization, has
one overriding goal: the destruction of America. And they'll be the
first ones to tell you.

This is an organization which actually supports:

Of course Black lives matter. All lives matter to me, and of course to
God who created them. No one's life does not matter. But Black Lives
Matter doesn't care about Black lives. It only cares about one thing:
destroying America and re-making it into a Marxist paradise.

*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.
Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a
civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not
misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously. My mental well-being
isn\'t worth your harassing, inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I
wrote, tough shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is
un-cited opinion masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m
wrong, write your own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site,
not a debate site. If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually,
you\'re wrong,\" don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment.
Put anything vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be
followed by a block and a mute, and a BNBR report. I will do this
immediately and with no compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*
