Christians and Muslims are both human. They both live on Earth. They
have rights as human beings.

Oh, did you mean relating in terms of religion? Well, they both believe
that their religion is right and the other guy's religion is wrong. They
each believe that they will receive salvation and the other guy will
not. So they can both relate in that way. They both teach the existence
of angels and demons.

But in terms of their *religions*, they are pretty much diametrically
opposed.

Christianity believes things that Islam does not. For example,
Christianity believes that Christ died and was resurrected three days
later. Islam believes that Christ never died. Islam believes that Christ
was a prophet (a good one), and not deity. But as C.S. Lewis points out,
if Christ was not deity, then he was a really *bad* prophet, because he
claimed to be God. If he wasn't what he claimed to be, then he was
either crazy, or a liar. Hardly a good prophet.

We should all accept and respect people who have different beliefs than
we do. But we should not accept the insane notion that all religious
beliefs are true. Because contradictory religious beliefs exist, and
mutually exclusive beliefs cannot all be true, we should not pretend
that they are.

In fact, it could be dangerous to do so. If Christianity is true, then
it's dangerous to your eternal destiny to not be Christian. Similarly,
if Islam is true, then it's dangerous to your eternal destiny to not be
Muslim.
