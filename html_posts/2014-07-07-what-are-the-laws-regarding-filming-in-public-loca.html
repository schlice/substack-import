**Content:** [With little variation, if you are in a public place,
anything you see is fair game. If someone doesn\'t want to be videoed,
or have their picture taken, they shouldn\'t be out in public. There is
no \"reasonable expectation of privacy\" in a public place. Someone can
tell you to stop, but if you are in public and the subject you are
recording is also in public, you\'re okay. The basic rule of thumb to
follow in public is \"if you can see it, you can shoot it.\"\
\
If you are in a business that is open to the public, however, the rules
change slightly. Unless it is clearly posted that you cannot take
pictures within the business, you are also allowed to video whatever you
like, but the owner of the business (or an employee) is allowed to tell
you to stop and if you fail to comply, he can ask you to leave. As soon
as he does, that public place is no longer \"public\" to you, and you
must vacate immediately or risk being tossed out by law enforcement for
trespassing.\
\
If someone has a \"reasonable expectation of privacy,\" they cannot be
videoed without their consent. If you are on private property, taking
photos is considered trespassing. While most government buildings are
fine, courthouses are off-limits for photography, as well as military
bases.\
\
Generally, when someone is shooting a film in a public place, the people
on camera will sign forms authorizing the film studio to use their
likeness in that film. This is something completely different: you can
certainly video someone in public, but you cannot use anyone\'s
recognizable likeness for commercial gain without their consent. There
are some allowances for \"artistic use\" and news organizations covered
by the 1st Amendment, but generally if you sell the film, you owe the
people in the film a portion of the profit.\
