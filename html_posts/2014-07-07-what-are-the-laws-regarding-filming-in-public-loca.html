<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [With little variation, if you are in a public place,<br>anything you see is fair game. If someone doesn\'t want to be videoed,<br>or have their picture taken, they shouldn\'t be out in public. There is<br>no \"reasonable expectation of privacy\" in a public place. Someone can<br>tell you to stop, but if you are in public and the subject you are<br>recording is also in public, you\'re okay. The basic rule of thumb to<br>follow in public is \"if you can see it, you can shoot it.\"\<br>\<br>If you are in a business that is open to the public, however, the rules<br>change slightly. Unless it is clearly posted that you cannot take<br>pictures within the business, you are also allowed to video whatever you<br>like, but the owner of the business (or an employee) is allowed to tell<br>you to stop and if you fail to comply, he can ask you to leave. As soon<br>as he does, that public place is no longer \"public\" to you, and you<br>must vacate immediately or risk being tossed out by law enforcement for<br>trespassing.\<br>\<br>If someone has a \"reasonable expectation of privacy,\" they cannot be<br>videoed without their consent. If you are on private property, taking<br>photos is considered trespassing. While most government buildings are<br>fine, courthouses are off-limits for photography, as well as military<br>bases.\<br>\<br>Generally, when someone is shooting a film in a public place, the people<br>on camera will sign forms authorizing the film studio to use their<br>likeness in that film. This is something completely different: you can<br>certainly video someone in public, but you cannot use anyone\'s<br>recognizable likeness for commercial gain without their consent. There<br>are some allowances for \"artistic use\" and news organizations covered<br>by the 1st Amendment, but generally if you sell the film, you owe the<br>people in the film a portion of the profit.\<br>\<br>\<br>\<br>*LEGAL NOTICE: This answer is not a substitute for professional legal<br>advice, nor is it a solicitation to offer legal advice. If you ignore<br>this warning and convey confidential information in a private message or<br>comment, there is no duty to keep that information confidential or<br>forego representation adverse to your interests. SEEK THE ADVICE OF A<br>LICENSED ATTORNEY in the appropriate jurisdiction before taking any<br>action that may affect your rights. If you believe you have a claim<br>against someone, consult an attorney immediately, otherwise there is a<br>risk that the time allotted to bring your claim may expire.
