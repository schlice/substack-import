He has *a right* to not talk to his daughter again.

*But he bases his decision on fear-mongering rather than science, and
that is incredibly foolish.* He ignores her individuality and her right
to choose for her own body what is best, instead imposing his own
morality over hers. This is incredibly insensitive and foolish. In other
words, the father is a complete moron.

The CDC doesn't help if you ask them, because they use the 18--29 age
group range as the "reference range." This is what happens when your
"scientific study" doesn't have a "control group" to study against.

This isn't "science." It's "educated guesswork." But you can at least
see that the risk scales upward the older you get.

In short, it is *exceedingly unlikely* that a normal, healthy 20-year
old would even be hospitalized, much less die, from COVID infection
(barring any comorbidities, of course). And knowing that there are risks
for 20-year olds taking the vaccine that older adults do not face also
should **rightly** weigh on the mind of the 20-year old and should
influence their decision about whether or not to vaccinate.

**TL;DR: He can do whatever he wants with his daughter, but he is
terribly foolish to do so. The science does not agree with his
decision.**

Original question:

A father insulted and decided to stay away forever from his 20-year-old
daughter who decided not to get vaccinated against covid-19 because he
says he prefers not to find out when his daughter dies from covid-19. Is
the father right?

*This is a contentious and emotionally-charged topic. I have taken the
(unusual for me) step of leaving comments open.*

*Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a
civil manner. But do not misunderstand, I take this step very
cautiously, and I have no tolerance for harassing or inane behavior.*

*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is
grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,
downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora
is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you are simply
commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" don\'t be surprised
if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything vaguely harassing in
there, and your deletion will be followed by a block/mute, and a BNBR
report. I will do this immediately and with no compunction. You have
been warned. Be nice.*
