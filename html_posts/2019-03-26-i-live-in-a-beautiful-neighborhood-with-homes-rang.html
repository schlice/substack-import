**I live in a beautiful neighborhood with homes ranging in price from
\$500k to over million. The owners of one home have neglected to
maintain their home and it's an eyesore. We have an HOA. What can we
do?**

That is squarely in the ballpark of the HOA.

The only thing you can do: contact your HOA and let them handle it.

If your HOA does not address the exterior maintenance of homes, there's
nothing you can do. Only an HOA would have control over the external
appearance of someone else's home. Without them, you don't have any
other recourse.
