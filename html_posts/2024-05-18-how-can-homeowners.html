The problem is that the HOA is the one *imposing* the onerous
restrictions and fees.

The only way to prevent this is to **get involved**. Run for a Board
seat. If you don't want to be a Director on the Board, just stay in
contact with the Board and give them the "pulse" of the neighborhood.
Let them know what people think about proposed rule changes and/or fees.
Back it up with data if you have it.

The rub, of course, is that most people love to complain about their HOA
and their Board, and no one wants to do anything about it.

Every time I was on a Board, my Board email was connected with my phone.
I'd respond **same-day** to any homeowner who had questions or comments,
because I was committed to the neighborhood and the homeowners. I wanted
to do what was right by them, so they could always reach me.

I know it's not like that everywhere, but in general, HOAs do try to do
right by the neighborhood, as they are homeowners as well.
