**Content:** [The article talks about a piece of malware that was
developed by the FBI to track users of the dark net who are doing such
things as distributing kiddie porn. It would be really hard to
\"accidentally\" be there, as no ad servers link to illegal systems. The
people who operate dark net servers don\'t advertise their services on
Google. You can\'t click a search link or an ad and accidentally end up
looking at kiddie porn. The people who do see that stuff actually intend
to do so, and it would be really hard to accidentally do so.\
\
The real concern is the breadth and depth of the FBI\'s hacking
operation. They went so far as to modify their malware to take advantage
of a security hole in the Tor browser bundle, which most people use to
browse with Tor.\
\
The FBI used the software to identify these users and then they
monitored them for quite some time, almost a year according to the
article. If you were a casual link-clicker and you clicked on something
you didn\'t mean to, the FBI would pretty quickly figure out that they
were wasting their time watching you.]{.rendered_qtext}
