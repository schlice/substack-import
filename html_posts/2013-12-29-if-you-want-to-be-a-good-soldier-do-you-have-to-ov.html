<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Mark Twain said, \"Courage is resistance to fear, mastery<br>of fear, not absence of fear.\"\<br>\<br>No, you don\'t have to overcome your fear of death. Fear is good, it<br>makes you sharp, it heightens your senses. You do have to learn to<br>control your fear, use it to your advantage.\<br>\<br>Fear of death is controlled by coming to grips with the fact that you<br>may have to give your life for your country. You prepare as best as you<br>can; you make wills and continuity plans for what would happen to your<br>family should you return from the war zone in a box rather than in a<br>seat. You make peace with the fact that what you are doing is noble and<br>just and it is worth dying for. There\'s no easy way to do that. It<br>takes time and personal introspection, before you go to<br>war.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
