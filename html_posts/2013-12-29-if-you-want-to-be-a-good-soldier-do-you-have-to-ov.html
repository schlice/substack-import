**Content:** [Mark Twain said, \"Courage is resistance to fear, mastery
of fear, not absence of fear.\"\
\
No, you don\'t have to overcome your fear of death. Fear is good, it
makes you sharp, it heightens your senses. You do have to learn to
control your fear, use it to your advantage.\
\
Fear of death is controlled by coming to grips with the fact that you
may have to give your life for your country. You prepare as best as you
can; you make wills and continuity plans for what would happen to your
family should you return from the war zone in a box rather than in a
seat. You make peace with the fact that what you are doing is noble and
just and it is worth dying for. There\'s no easy way to do that. It
takes time and personal introspection, before you go to
war.]{.rendered_qtext}
