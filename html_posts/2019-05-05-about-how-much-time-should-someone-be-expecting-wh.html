**About how much time should someone be expecting when they go to court
for being charged with possession of a weapon + ammunition while being a
felon?**

The answer, as with any legal answer, is "it depends."

Each state has different sentencing guidelines, and they're built in to
every statute in every state. In general, most states will sentence
anywhere from two to ten years for felon in possession. However, because
the defendant is a prior felon, punishments tend to be on the higher
side than other similar crimes. Some states will "enhance" a punishment
at final conviction, other states will deny probation. Still other
states will enhance a punishment if the defendant not only possessed a
gun, but attempted (or succeeded) in using the gun in some potentially
dangerous way.
