**What are some useful hacks for someone with multiple sclerosis?**

The answer is "it depends."

For me, who sometimes has bouts of "forgetfulness," having my
"electronic brain" with me is a big help. Remembering lists of things to
do, important phone numbers, and calendar entries are just a few of the
things that I use my phone for.

I also have a smart watch. It helps show me notifications of the
reminders I routinely set.

I also get fatigued easily, so I have to make sure that I get most of my
activities done in the morning or in the middle of the day. When evening
comes, I'm relatively useless.

There are hacks for most of the little MS niggles. Just need to know
which niggle you want to focus on.
