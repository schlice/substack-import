**Content:** [This is a great question, and the assignment of rights to
the states and to the people was done in the Bill of Rights, the
amendments to the Constitution.\
\
The Constitution itself does not enumerate rights. It defines the limits
of government. The tenth amendment specifically reaffirms this by saying
that any powers not expressly enumerated to the federal government being
to the states, or to the people.\
\
The use of the term \"the states\" indicates that a right is granted to
state and local government, and not to the federal government. This part
of the amendment has been used a number of times when the federal
government has tried to force states to enforce federal law.\
\
The term \"the people\" was used three times in the Bill of Rights and
it indicates an individual right given to each and every person in the
country individually. For example, the Second Amendment says that \"the
right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\" The
courts reaffirmed this as an individual right, not a right gained by
participating in a group activity.]{.rendered_qtext}
