Jesus talked about this in the Sermon on the Mount:

> If your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it
> away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your
> whole body to be thrown into hell. And if your right hand causes you
> to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose
> one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell. ---
> Matthew 5:29--30 NIV

Jesus was talking specifically in this passage about committing the sin
of adultery, but he described it by using hyperbole, of course. He
wasn't advocating self-mutilation. He was trying to get the point across
that sin is *that important* to get a handle on that it would be better
to lose a body part than to have your whole body cast into hell.

Think about that. God wants *so badly* for us to avoid sin that he'd
hyperbolically state that you should cut off the offensive part of your
body if it causes you to sin.

Understanding the force behind what Jesus said, if your friend was
causing you to sin, wouldn't the guidance be to "cut out" that friend
from your life? And in all truth, if you have a "friend" who turns you
away from God, is that really a great example of a "friend?" Perhaps
it's *you* who should be bringing your "friend" to God, not your
"friend" bringing you away from God.

Food for thought.
