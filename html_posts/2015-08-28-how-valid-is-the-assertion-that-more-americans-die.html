**Content:** [The numbers are true, but the numbers are misleading. 9/11
was the largest terrorist attack on US shores, and only around 2900
died.\
\
In 2011, about 8500 died from gun homicides. But that same year, over
15,000 died from alcohol-induced liver disease. Over 16,000 were killed
by a drunk driver. When you look at all alcohol-related deaths (not
caused by accident or homicide), it\'s over 25,000.\
\
Care to bet how many of those 8500 homicides involved alcohol in some
way?\
\
Yet I bet you that you\'re not thinking of banning alcohol. Hmm, I
wonder why that is.]{.rendered_qtext}
