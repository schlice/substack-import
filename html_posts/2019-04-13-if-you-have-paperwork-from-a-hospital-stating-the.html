**If you have paperwork from a hospital stating the medication they gave
you can a probation officer violate you for a positive drug test for the
same thing they gave you in the hospital?**

Generally no. I can't speak for every state everywhere, but generally
the law reads "possession of a controlled substance without a
prescription." The parole agreement stipulates whether or not it is
"possession of any controlled substance" or "possession of a controlled
substance without a prescription."

There may be some probation agreements which stipulate that the parolee
may not have any controlled substances, even those prescribed by a
doctor. This is especially true when the parolee is an addict. Addicts
should know that any controlled substance can trigger their addiction,
and should avoid prescription narcotics anyway.

If in doubt, the parolee should ask his or her PO before they violate.
If it does violate parole, this may give the parolee an opportunity to
go back to the doctor and request a different (non-controlled)
medication.
