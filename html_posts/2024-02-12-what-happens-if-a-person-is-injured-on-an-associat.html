The "Private Property" signs alert people that permission is required
before entering. HOA members and their guests, under normal
circumstances, have ongoing permission to access HOA property without
additional permissions.

If a person is injured on Association property, the Association
maintains general liability insurance which would pay if the Association
was found to be liable for any portion, or all of, the injury. The
insurance adjustors handle the liability investigation.
