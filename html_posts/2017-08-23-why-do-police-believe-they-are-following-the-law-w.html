There is actually only one question here:

> *Why do police they believe they are following the law, when they are
> enforcing state laws that violate the constitution?*

Police enforce state law. If a law is part of state law, the police
enforce it. The question presumes that police are allowed to selectively
enforce the law based on their view of the law's constitutionality, and
this is not the case. The police are required to enforce the law as it
is written until a court invalidates the law.

In actuality, a law may violate the Constitution, and be fully
enforceable, but it is only invalidated when the courts say that it
violates the Constitution.

In other words, a city or a state can enact a law which is in violation
of the Constitution. That law is valid until a court says that it is
unconstitutional. This means that someone must be charged under the law,
and that person must challenge the charge on the grounds that the law
violates the Constitution. If the courts find that the law does indeed
violate the Constitution, the law becomes unenforceable.
