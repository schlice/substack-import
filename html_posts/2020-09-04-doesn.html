**Doesn\'t \"From my cold, dead hands\" sound a lot better than \"I lost
it at a boating accident\"? Why the latter?**

One or the other of those two phrases would be uttered if some
government agent knocked on your door and ordered you to turn over all
of your firearms because somehow either the Constitution was invalidated
or the 2nd Amendment was repealed.

You could either shout, "You'll get my guns when you pry them from my
cold, dead hands!" and they might take you up on your offer.

Or, you could say, "Oh, sorry, I had my entire gun collection out with
me on a deep-sea fishing trip (while simultaneously ignoring why you
would have your entire gun collection on a deep-sea fishing vessel) when
a rogue wave suddenly washed them all overboard."

Presumably, the 4th and 5th Amendments were still a thing in this
hypothetical example and the police still needed a warrant to search
your house. In order to get a warrant, they would somehow need to
possess information proving that you had committed a crime, which in
this wild hypothetical would mean that gun possession had
unconstitutionally become illegal (*ex post facto*), and they had actual
evidence that you had said firearms in your possession. While they might
be (illegally) able to obtain purchase records to show that at one time
you bought them, there is no requirement to register firearms, so there
is no requirement to report them lost to anyone.

So unless you committed a crime, there likely isn't a warrant to search
your house, so no one is getting your firearms. So the second phrase is
better because you are legally safe. And you don't die.
