There are several reasons why your phone may not have received the
Wireless Emergency Alert.

1.  You were not connected to a cell tower which was capable of
    transmitting the WEA signal.
2.  Your phone is not capable of receiving a WEA signal. Some older
    handsets are not capable of receiving WEA signals.

In either case, you should call your carrier's Customer Service number
(usually 611 from your phone) and inform them that you did not receive
the WEA signal, and let them assist you with troubleshooting. Let them
know where your exact physical location was from approximately 2:15 PM
EDT to 3:15 PM EDT today (3 Oct 2018) so they can research the cell
tower to which you were connected. They should also have this
information themselves, but it helps the process move a little quicker
if they can pinpoint the tower(s) to which you were connected.
