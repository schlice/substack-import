**Why did a federal judge blocks Mississippi\'s new abortion law?**

The particular federal judge they *chose* (in a process called "court
shopping") is very pro-abortion. He heard arguments that the law would
destroy the abortion industry (it will) and decided that while the
constitutionality of the law is under review, the law should not go into
effect.

That's fine. The purpose wasn't to block abortions. The purpose was to
challenge the constitutionality of *Roe v. Wade.*
