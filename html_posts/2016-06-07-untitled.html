I did address that, since most departments have policies about what you
can and can't do in uniform.

For example, the military says that you are certainly allowed to attend
political meetings and rallies, but you cannot do so in uniform, because
the *perception* would be one of military sponsorship of that activity.

The problem with police officers is that they are *always* police
officers, 24x7, and they *never* do not have their authority as police
officers, whether or not they are "on duty." The only real way to
determine, therefore, whether or not an officer is "on duty" is the
presence of the uniform. The uniform signifies the office and that the
officer is acting under authority of the office.

As I said, most major departments have addressed this in policy. Small
town departments may not address this, since everyone already knows who
the police officer is, uniform or not.
