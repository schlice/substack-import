The prison system in the United States is indeed rehabilitative, but it
is also a form of punishment. Restricting your freedom in a free society
is one of the most profound punishments you can receive.

Some people, however, don't mind.

As a matter of fact, during my senior level Criminal Justice class, I
spoke to a few inmates in our medium-security prison in the mid 90's who
were able to tell me exactly what crime they were planning on
committing, at exactly what age, so that they would be sent back to
medium-security for the remainder of their days. Basically, since they
didn't find medium-security prison all that objectionable, they decided
that it would be their retirement plan. Get arrested, get thrown in
medium-security, and live comfortably the rest of your days, at the
expense of the taxpayer.

If they succeeded, they should be cooling their senior-citizen heels in
there right now.

If you can do the time, the crime becomes nothing more than a means to
an end.
