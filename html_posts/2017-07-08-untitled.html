Not everywhere, or free climbing wouldn\'t be a thing. There are no
state laws which require you to wear safety gear.

> *They likely also sign waivers and pay extra insurance premiums too.*

Again, not everywhere. And the difference, again, is that there are no
state laws which require you to carry "rock climbers insurance" and if
you\'re caught without it you lose your rock climbing license. So the
analogy still does not hold.

Probably, but usually only if the obesity has no medically identifiable
cause. If there is a cause, then the cause is treated, and the obesity
is considered a secondary response to the underlying condition.

Otherwise, obesity is considered a lifestyle condition. If it wasn\'t,
elective stomach stapling surgery wouldn\'t work.
