**How intrusive is an HOA allowed to be? Can they tell me how to
landscape my backyard?**

HOAs can be as intrusive as their Covenants and Rules & Regulations
allow them to be.

**In general**, HOAs deal with the outside of your house. Things like
how your yard looks, what products you can use to landscape, what your
landscaping looks like, what colors and products you can use on the
outside of your house, etc.

It is very infrequently that an HOA controls the inside of your house.
The only time I have seen an HOA be that intrusive is when it deals with
garages. I have seen an HOA state that you cannot use garages as storage
units and that cars must be stored in garages before they get parked on
driveways (it was a pretty restrictive HOA).

So can they tell you how to landscape your backyard? Absolutely.
