**Can an HOA require a homeowner to decorate for the holidays?**

Unless that Association also requires homeowners to be part of the group
for the holiday required, no.

For example, if your association only allows Jews to buy houses in your
area, then the HOA could also require homeowners to decorate for
Hanukkah.

However, since housing cannot be conditioned on religion, this would be
illegal, so therefore, an HOA can similarly not force a homeowner to
decorate for the holidays.
