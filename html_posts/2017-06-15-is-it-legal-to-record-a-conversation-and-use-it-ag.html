Massachusetts is a "two-party" state. This means that both parties to
the conversation must be aware that the conversation is being recorded,
or it may not be used as evidence (in other words, no "secret"
recordings are allowed). Some two-party states require that the
recordings have a "recording tone," which is essentially a beep every 15
seconds indicating that the conversation is being recorded. You will
often hear this tone if you call 911, as their calls are always
recorded. In Massachusetts, the recording tone should be sufficient to
inform all parties that the recording is not "secret," but to be safe,
if you are recording, you should always announce to all parties that the
call is being recorded. If a party to a conversation does not want to be
recorded, it is up to that party to leave the conversation. By the way,
this applies to any recording in which audio is captured; this includes
video recordings with audio, unless you are recording the police
performing their duties in public. This is separately protected under
the First Amendment.

In the rest of the US, some states are two-party like Massachusetts and
require the recording tone, some two-party states do not require the
tone, and others are "one-party," which means that at least one party in
the conversation must be aware that it is being recorded. One-party
states do not require recording tones.

Check with the laws in your state before recording a conversation and
expecting to be able to use it as evidence.
