Short answer: everything which has not been granted to the government or
denied to the states.

We'll do this as a math problem for better understanding. This actually
may be more confusing to some, but I'm trying here.

1.  Enumerate all the powers granted to the government in the
    Constitution.
2.  Add to the answer to step 1 any power expressly forbidden by the
    Constitution to be a state power.
3.  Subtract the answer to step 2 from ***ANYTHING YOU COULD CONSIDER TO
    BE A POWER.***

What you have remaining are the powers left to the states respectively,
or to the people.

The Tenth Amendment has been characterized as a "trusim" rather than a
power granted or denied. It reaffirms the understanding of the people
who wrote the Constitution that any power not expressly granted to the
government or denied to the states belongs to the states, or to the
people. In other words, "All is retained which has not been
surrendered." (United States v. Darby, 312 U.S. 100, 124 (1941))

*The actual text of the Tenth Amendment: The powers not delegated to the
United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States,
are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.*
