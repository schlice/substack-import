**Trump has stated that he will run for President in 2024. Do you think
his cult will stand behind him for 4 years and then rise to the occasion
again?**

There is a small cohort of people who love Trump for Trump. They will
support him in 2024, regardless of who else runs alongside him.

Those people are the minority of Republicans.

If the Republican Party puts up a strong candidate alongside him (and
there are a few who have a shot --- Tom Cotton, Mike Pompeo, Nikki
Haley, etc), he won't have a snowball's chance.

Trump was a reaction to 8 years of Obama, and putting him up against
someone who was as unlikable a candidate as Hillary Clinton ensured his
victory. After experiencing the left's constant anti-Trump campaign for
four years, and then putting him up against someone who is just likable
enough, even if not energetic or enthusiastic (like Biden), and he
loses. That should tell you something. With any luck, it tells the GOP
something.

But don't misinterpret. Simply because there is a cohort of
"all-Trump-all-the-time" Republicans does not mean that all Republicans
think this way. Far from it.
