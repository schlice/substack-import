Before you can answer why we get sick and die, we have to answer what it
is about us that is made in God's image.

Even atheists know that God has no physical form. He has no body. They
can't see Him, they can't detect Him, so they don't believe in Him. So
how can humans be made in the image of God if He has no body?

We just described God. Is there anything in humans that has no physical
form, that is separate from our bodies, which might be said to "live on"
after we die?

It's our *soul*.

Our soul is made in the image of God. Not our bodies.

So now that we know this, we can talk about these perfect bodies which
God created for us. They never know pain. They never get sick. They
never die.

Well, that's how they were designed, anyway. Until sin invaded the
world. Once that happened, our bodies became *fallen*. They became
*mortal*. Women would know the pain of childbirth. Men would get old,
get sick, and die. They would scratch at the hard ground to plant their
food, and their life would be filled with struggle.

We live in a fallen world, in fallen, mortal bodies, because of sin. But
we're not out to save our bodies. We're out to save our *souls*. God's
plan for our world was already revealed to the apostle John and has been
recorded in the book of Revelation. It describes the end of the world
and the fact that believers will be resurrected to live with God
forever. That is our hope.
