**What can I do when a Homeowner\'s Association pops up in my
neighborhood? I purchased my home years ago and I specifically wanted
somewhere that a HOA didn\'t exist. Is my only option to move? The rules
have already been making an impact.**

The first thing you have to do is check that massive stack of paper you
signed when you bought your house. Make sure that there is no covenants
in it. Covenants that you signed when you bought your house would
indicate that there was actually an HOA in place.

**As long as you did not sign anything when you bought your house that
joins you to an HOA, and you did not sign anything while you owned your
house that added you to an HOA, then you are not part of an HOA.** The
only time you don't have to be part of an HOA is when it is formed
*after* you have purchased your home.

As long as you are 100% sure that you signed nothing to indicate that
you are part of the HOA, then you are fine. Ignore the rules. Ignore the
letters they send telling you they're going to sue you. If they do sue,
simply tell them you are not part of the HOA, and make it up to them to
prove that you are. They won't. If they say that 75% of the homeowners
can make rules that affect 100% of homeowners, they are wrong, and the
court will invalidate any rule or portion of the covenants that says so.
See my bolded statement above. If you were not part of an HOA **when you
bought your home** and the neighborhood decides to create one, you are
under no obligation to join it unless you choose to do so.

If you do sell your house, then the *next* buyer can join the HOA.ยน

But not you.

If you still feel uncomfortable ignoring the letters and the threats
from the HOA, I would suggest retaining an attorney. You would be
looking for a real estate attorney in your local area who specializes in
homeowner's association laws.

Good luck!

ยน Understand that there is a difference between a **mandatory** and a
**voluntary** HOA. In order for the Association to be **mandatory**, in
most cases you must have 100% participation from all the homeowners.
Some states do not require 100% agreement to create a mandatory HOA;
check your state laws to be sure. If you do not have the state-required
level of participation, the Association cannot be mandatory; it can only
be **voluntary**. A voluntary HOA cannot place liens on homes and cannot
force compliance with rules. It also cannot force any members to join.
It's more like a voluntary community club than an association. So for
instance, your voluntary HOA could fund improvements on a walking trail,
or fund cleanup of a lakeshore. You can choose to join the HOA or not;
it won't affect your access to the walking trail or the lake. Voluntary
HOAs are also sometimes called *affinity groups.*

A voluntary HOA can become mandatory, with the state-required
participation of current homeowners. **Of course, your mileage may vary.
Some states (i.e. Georgia) do not permit voluntary HOAs to become
mandatory HOAs. Check your state laws before taking any action.**

You cannot have a mixed association; you're either 100% mandatory or you
are voluntary; you cannot have both.

New construction HOAs are set up by the developer before any of the lots
are sold, so they are mandatory, as the developer has spoken for all
lots.
