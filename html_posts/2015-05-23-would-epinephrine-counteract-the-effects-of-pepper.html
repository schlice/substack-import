**Content:** [Probably not. Epinepherine is a hormone, not an
antihistamine. It\'s used for treating anaphylaxis, not histamines.\
\
You might consider something like Benadryl (an antihistamine) if you
wanted to reduce the swelling and some of the mucous production from the
mucous membranes. An NSAID like Motrin would also be beneficial.\
\
There are topically-applied products that can remove the oil from your
skin; ambulance crews carry these products to treat people sprayed with
pepper spray.\
\
But there isn\'t any oral or injectable medication that will completely
counteract pepper spray.]{.rendered_qtext}
