**Content:** [Cliff\'s answer is correct, generally \"defense of self\"
and \"defense of others\" are interchangeable, as long as all of the
criteria for \"defense of self\" are met. In other words, if you were
\"the other,\" would you have a right to use deadly force, and if the
answer is yes, you have the same right to use deadly force in defense of
another.\
\
States will take a very narrow view of this statute, as Cliff said, to
prevent vigilantism, but in this case, I think the state will focus more
on the fact that he was a former officer (and probably carries a silver
\"retired\" shield) than the fact that he was acting in \"defense of
others.\"]{.rendered_qtext}
