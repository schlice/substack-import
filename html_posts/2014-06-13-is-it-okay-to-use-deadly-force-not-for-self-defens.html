<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Cliff\'s answer is correct, generally \"defense of self\"<br>and \"defense of others\" are interchangeable, as long as all of the<br>criteria for \"defense of self\" are met. In other words, if you were<br>\"the other,\" would you have a right to use deadly force, and if the<br>answer is yes, you have the same right to use deadly force in defense of<br>another.\<br>\<br>States will take a very narrow view of this statute, as Cliff said, to<br>prevent vigilantism, but in this case, I think the state will focus more<br>on the fact that he was a former officer (and probably carries a silver<br>\"retired\" shield) than the fact that he was acting in \"defense of<br>others.\"]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
