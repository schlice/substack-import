Two questions here, I'll take them one at a time:

> Why does God not give the sort of evidence for his existence that
> atheists are looking for?

First of all, *what is the evidence atheists are looking for?* Should
God float down from heaven on a massive cloud and zap all the bad people
and instantly end all war and suffering? Would that be the evidence they
would need to believe in God?

Probably. But there is one primary reason why God will not do this:

Free will.

God has given us free will, and he wants us to choose him freely,
without coercion. If he were to float down on a cloud as I stated, *his
presence would be so overpowering that it would override our free will*.
We would have **no choice** but to believe in him. And he doesn't want
to do that to us.\
\
The simple fact is that God has given us enough evidence in this world
to convince anyone who is willing to believe, but has left just enough
ambiguity so as to not compel the unwilling. For love must be given
freely, it cannot be coerced.

Ask an atheist who is willing to have an honest conversation the
following question: *If I could present evidence which would reasonably
answer all of your questions and doubts about Christianity ---
reasonable to such a degree that it seems likely that Christianity is
true* ***beyond a reasonable doubt*** *--- would you become a
Christian?*

If the answer is still no, then the problem is not one of evidence.
There is a difference between *proving* a proposition and *accepting*
the truth of that proposition. I can provide all of the evidence you
need to prove the truth, but it is up to you to accept that truth. In
the case of the atheist who still will not become Christian, the problem
is not one of evidence. The problem is volitional or emotional, not
merely intellectual. In other words, no amount of evidence would
convince such an atheist, because evidence is not what's in their way
--- they are.

Original question:

Why does God not give the sort of evidence for his existence that
atheists are looking for? Wouldn't that just shut them up or would they
just ignore that evidence and continue not believing?
