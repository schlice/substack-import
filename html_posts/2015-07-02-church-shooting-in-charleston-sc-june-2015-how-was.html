**Content:** [As most everyone else said, the local arrest records
showed that Roof had a misdemeanor drug charge, not a felony. He was
still legally allowed to purchase a firearm. He was arrested in a mall
in South Carolina for being in possession of Suboxone, which is a drug
for heroin addiction treatment. He was under indictment for that charge
at the time. However, that drug charge was a misdemeanor, not a felony,
and would not have prevented Roof from purchasing a gun under Federal
law.]{.rendered_qtext}
