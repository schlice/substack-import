**Content:** [You cannot sue a company because their UI is difficult to
use.\
\
First off, you voluntarily use their software. No one forces you to use
the software.\
\
Second, your discomfort is not an actionable offense, especially when
you affirmatively choose to actually use their software, and thus
consent to inflicting your discomfort upon yourself.\
\
Your legal remedy in such a case is to choose with your wallet. Don\'t
use their service. Use a competitor\'s service with a better UI. And if
a competitor\'s service with a better UI does not exist, I think you
just found yourself a business opportunity.]{.rendered_qtext}
