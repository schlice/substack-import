The generally-accepted term for viewpoints like this would be considered
a form of **eugenics**. Eugenics is "the study of how to arrange
reproduction within a human population to increase the occurrence of
heritable characteristics regarded as desirable." And while being a
Democrat is not a "heritable characteristic," being Black is.

The people who initially put the abortion industry together were
eugenicists. Margaret Sanger, the founder of what would become Planned
Parenthood, was a known eugenicist, even though modern-day Planned
Parenthood disavows this history.

But before I get too far into the weeds, I need to get this part out:

**Killing babies because they could become Democrats is abhorrent, even
for people on Quora.**

**Killing babies because they are Black is** ***even more abhorrent*.**
I can't even believe that in 2023 I have to type that sentence.

However, it's hard to ignore the correlations. More Planned Parenthood
locations are found in poor, predominantly-Black neighborhoods than
elsewhere in cities and towns. Consequently, in places like New York
City, more Black babies are aborted than born. Literally, the most
dangerous place in NYC to be a Black baby is in the womb.

But is it *correlation* or *causation?* Are Planned Parenthood locations
near Black communities because that's where they are needed, or are
Planned Parenthood locations placed *specifically* into Black
communities to make it easier for them to access and use, thus reducing
their population by their own choice? You convince women that killing
babies is "empowering" and you let them cull their own population.

This is the basis of eugenics.

The Republican platform is decidedly pro-life. Republicans strictly
oppose "elective abortions." There are a scant few reasons Republicans
as a whole would ever support abortion, and those might be cases of rape
or incest. If it's a "one-or-the-other" medical situation, this is also
not an "elective abortion." Saving a mother's life is a red herring, as
lifesaving measures which inadvertently cause death to the baby are not
abortions.

**Republicans would never support abortion on the off-chance that a baby
might become a Democrat. Republicans would never support abortions
because a baby is Black.**

Those are simply non-starters.
