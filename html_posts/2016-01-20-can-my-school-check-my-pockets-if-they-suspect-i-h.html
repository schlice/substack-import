Schools are funny places when it comes to the law. You actually don\'t
have the same set of rights in a school that you have outside of a
school, because the school is required to maintain an orderly and safe
environment for all students.

If the school has a \"No Phones Allowed\" rule and that rule allows them
to physically search you for a phone, then they can do it. You\'ll have
to check the Student Handbook to see the actual rule.

You could also ask them to show you the rule.

If you don\'t think you were treated fairly or justly, have your parents
contact the principal and set up a meeting.
