*Loving* and *Obergefell* were both legally sound decisions.

*Roe* was built on shaky ground from the outset. It was based on the
legally-tenuous *Griswold v. Connecticut* decision, and it was just a
bad decision all around.

*Loving* and *Obergefell* are not in danger of being overturned just
because *Roe* is.
