The actual purchase of a car is very easy, if you agree to the price and
you are willing to buy dealer upsell items. There are some tax forms to
sign, a few dealer forms, and these take about 30 minutes if it\'s done
correctly and quickly.

What takes time:

- Haggling over price
- Dealer upselling

When you are negotiating your price with the sales team, there is a
great deal of back-and-forth that goes on. Generally, a floor salesman
does not have the authority to cement the actual numbers; a sales
manager must make that call. The \"numbers\" we are talking about
include the sale price of the car, the amount you will be paid for any
trade-in you wish to present, etc.

Once you actually cement a number (or a series of numbers) in place,
your car moves into \"prep\" where it is prepared for you to drive home,
and you move on to a \"finance manager.\" In this office, you will sign
the majority of the legal papers you need to sign in order to buy the
car. These include sales tax documentation, a bill of sale, temporary
number plates, etc. Additionally, this is where the dealer will attempt
to \"upsell\" you additional items like extended warranties and
dealer-included maintenance services. This is another process which
takes time. The finance manager has the ability to get even better loan
rates than you can get yourself, and they will often do this so that
they can sell you a maintenance package at what \"appears\" to be a
lower monthly payment, because they offered you a better loan rate than
you could get yourself. This is the beauty of the upsell, but again,
this takes more time.

Once you are done in the finance office, the only thing left is
\"delivery,\" where your car is presented to you. If it is new, a dealer
will go over many of the features of the car with you. Once delivery is
complete, the car is yours!
