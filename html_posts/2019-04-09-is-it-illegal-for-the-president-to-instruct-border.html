**Is it illegal for the President to instruct Border Patrol Agents to
break the law?**

No, it's not illegal to tell someone to break the law.

In fact, go rob a bank. Right now, go rob a bank.

See? I just told you to break the law. Was that illegal for me to do?
No, certainly not.

But would it still be illegal for you to rob a bank? Indeed it would,
even if I told you to do it.

If you read the article (and not just the headline), you'd see that the
President was expressing his frustration with the problems at our
southern border. While he'd "like" for agents to just unilaterally close
the border and change immigration policy, they know they can't do that.
They know they have to follow the law, which they continue to do.

Trump expresses the things that we all think. But not even he can order
someone to break the law.

We in the military know this as well. You are under no obligation to
obey an illegal order. If my commander told me to go into that village
and kill everyone, including the women and children, I could rightly
refuse to follow that order, and I wouldn't be insubordinate in doing
so.

There's no penalty for the officer issuing the illegal order. But
there's also no penalty for me in not following it.
