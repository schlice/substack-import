Short answer: no.

Longer answer: Your car is a **lethal weapon**. It can kill people.
Before you can run someone over, you have to prove that there was a
threat to your life or the lives of the people in your car. Most
definitely, if the protestors start smashing your car windows with rocks
or tools, by all means defend yourself and your family with whatever
means you have at your disposal (which in this case simply means lifting
your foot off the brake).

What ***should*** be happening is police should be getting tougher on
protestsors who block roadways. This is ***patently illegal***. You
cannot block a roadway and call it a protest. In fact, you must have a
permit to hold a protest on a public street so the road can be closed
and traffic re-routed. Additionally, if the police tell you to leave,
you must leave or you can be arrested for this alone.

This is not happening because right now, police chiefs are *afraid*. I
get that. But when do we stop being afraid and when do we wake up to the
fact that these are not protestors, they are **bullies**? I'd say call
in the Fire Department and let them practice putting out fires on these
protestors. A few seconds of being blasted by the truck-mounted water
cannon will clear them from the highway pretty quickly. It won't hurt
them, and if they get hurt and try to sue, they're going to have a hard
time explaining why they were standing in the middle of a highway,
illegally, attempting to protest without a permit.
