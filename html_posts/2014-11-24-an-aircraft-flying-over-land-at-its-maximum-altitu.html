title: '"An aircraft flying over land at its maximum altitude passes over a cliff
  where the land drops away several thousand feet, effectively increasing the altitude.
  Given the aircraft was at its maximum altitude, what would the effect be?"'

There are several altimeters in an aircraft, but they measure two
different heights:\
\
AGL: Above Ground Level, the distance above the ground. When an aircraft
is on the ground, this is zero.\
\
ASL: Above Sea Level: This is the standard that all aircraft use when
flying, as there must be a consistent baseline for all aircraft to
follow. Most aircraft use a \"pressure altimeter\" which uses barometric
pressure to calculate altitude. When ascending through 18,000 feet ASL,
aircraft set their altimeters to the universal standard 29.92 inHg. When
descending through 18,000 feet, aircraft are advised of the local
barometric pressure to which to set the altimeter. Aircraft will also
use GPS as a source of altitude, but it is not the primary altimeter.
The pressure altimeter is more accurate, as long as it is set based on
local conditions. When an aircraft is on the ground, this altimeter will
read the height of the aircraft above sea level.\
\
For instance, my favorite airfield (the airstrip at USAFA) is at 6565\'
above sea level. When the altimeter is set correctly, it reads 6565 when
on the ground. It\'s one of the settings you have to make when prepping
your aircraft to fly.]{.rendered_qtext}
