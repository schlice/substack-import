**Because income inequality should not be a thing.**

And here's the next big doozie of a line:

**Income inequality is good.**

*WHAT???????????!?!?!?!?!?!?!!??????*

Yep. I'll say it again. Income inequality is a good thing.

If you are at all curious, take literally four and a half minutes of
your life and watch this short video; you might learn something:

My boss, Michael Dell, is highlighted in this video. Please watch
carefully, it's literally less than five minutes. Before you post that
negative, disparaging comment about me, please watch the video. And yes,
#IWork4Dell.

(EDIT) So let me address these comments.

1.  Nothing about income inequality has anything whatsoever to do with
    poverty. If you look at poverty and your answer is "we have poverty
    because we have income inequality" then you probably failed
    Economics in college. Income inequality does not drive poverty.
2.  The rich do not keep the poor poor. As it said in the video, the
    door to the 1% club is always open, and new members are always
    welcome. You have to get yourself there. In this country, we still
    have what we call **opportunity**. There are over a million jobs
    that go unfilled in this country every year. None of them require a
    4-year degree, but almost all of them require some sort of
    vocational education. The jobs are there. It's up to the individual
    to get the education to take the jobs.
3.  In a free nation, you are welcome to give as much money as you want
    to the poor. In a free nation, you cannot force me to do the same.
    either through taxes or welfare programs (which are just taxes which
    specifically benefit the poor). Now don't misunderstand, this
    doesn't mean that welfare is a bad thing in and of itself. But in
    this country, we expect you to take advantage of the vast
    opportunities in vocational training laid out before you to make
    yourself useful. And if you say, "the vocational opportunities are
    not vast enough," maybe you should stop taking money from the rich
    and simply giving it to the poor and instead take money from the
    rich and improve vocational education for the poor so they can
    improve themselves.
4.  Laws do not make the rich, rich. Laws do not keep the rich, rich. I
    will concede, however, that tax law is heavily tilted in favor of
    the rich, but in a progressive tax system, your biggest customers
    get the lions share of the benefits. And when the top tier pays more
    than half of the tax revenue, they get the majority of the benefits.
