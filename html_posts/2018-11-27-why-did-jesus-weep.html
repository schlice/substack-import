**Why did Jesus cry in the Bible?**

Ah yes, the shortest sentence in the Bible:

"Jesus wept." (John 11:35) Upon seeing Mary and Martha's grieving over
Lazarus' death, He was moved to tears Himself.

However, Jesus came to Bethany in order to raise Lazarus from the dead.
He did not heal Lazarus remotely, in the same way He healed the
centurion's servant in Matthew 8:13. He delayed coming to Bethany
knowing that Lazarus would die before He arrived, so that He could raise
him upon His arrival.

Therefore, if Jesus knew that He was coming to Bethany in order to raise
Lazarus from the dead, shouldn't He have been triumphant? Shouldn't He
have been hopeful? Shouldn't He have been glad that He was about to
showcase the Father's power in all its glory?

Instead, he saw the sorrow, and he cried. Why?

One reason is because He took no comfort in the sorrow of others. He
knew what He had come to do, but He did not enjoy inflicting emotional
trauma on anyone, and it hurt Him to see them all hurting. He was truly
compassionate.

It could also be that He was "flashing forward," seeing the tomb of
Lazarus and knowing that His own death was only days away. He knew that
raising Lazarus would be the impetus that the Pharisees needed to
finally have Him arrested. Being fully human, we know Jesus experienced
everything a human does, so it's not inconceivable that Jesus would have
been fearful at that very moment.
