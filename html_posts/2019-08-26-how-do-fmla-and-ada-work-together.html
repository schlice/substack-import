**How do FMLA and ADA work together?**

Generally, you will find these two working together when it comes to
disability discrimination and wrongful termination lawsuits.

I'll give you a perfect example right here in my own back yard: **Hayes
v. SkyWest Airlines (2017),** which was heard by a Federal jury in
Denver.

The basics of the story:

> John Hayes worked as a trainer for SkyWest at Denver International
> Airport from 2006 to 2014. Prior to his health issues, Hayes had an
> excellent work record and was by all accounts a great employee.
>
> In 2013, Hayes was diagnosed with kidney disease. He had to start
> receiving regular dialysis treatment, for which he used his FMLA
> leave. In August 2014, Hayes' doctor cleared him to return to work.
> His only restriction prohibited him from lifting anything over 30
> pounds.
>
> Since he was a supervisor and never lifted things in the past, the
> accommodation should not have been an issue. Initially, SkyWest
> approved the restriction and Hayes resumed his position as a trainer.
> Within a week, however, SkyWest informed him that it would not honor
> his accommodation. SkyWest barred him from returning to work unless
> Hayes could lift over 30 pounds. Hayes requested SkyWest transfer him
> to a different position. SkyWest refused. Hayes then applied for six
> other positions within the company but wasn't offered any, thereby
> ending his employment with SkyWest.
>
> Hayes initially filed an internal complaint with SkyWest for
> discrimination and then with the EEOC. He then filed a lawsuit against
> his former employer, alleging violations of the ADA and FMLA. SkyWest
> sought to explain John's dismissal with seemingly contradictory
> arguments. First, they asserted that he was part of a mass layoff in
> 2014 involving over 600 employees. But SkyWest had offered those
> employees out-of-state transfers or year-long furloughs. SkyWest also
> argued that John's termination was necessary because he suffered a
> "medical incident" while at work. The incident in question was a bout
> of dizziness that John experienced shortly after returning to work in
> August 2014. John's doctor confirmed that occasional dizziness was a
> common issue for dialysis patients and would not impact his ability to
> fulfill his job duties.
>
> The jury did not find SkyWest's arguments convincing. It awarded John
> a judgment consisting of \$450,000.00 in actual damages, plus \$2
> million in punitive damages. SkyWest's apparent financial incentive to
> get rid of John Hayes was likely a factor contributing to the verdict.
> SkyWest self-funds its health insurance. It would save a lot of money
> if it fired John, rather than insuring him.[\[1\]](#JDOmw){#cite-JDOmw
