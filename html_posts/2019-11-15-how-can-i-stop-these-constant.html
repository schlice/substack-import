**How can I stop these constant \"Amber Alert\" text messages on my
phone?**

Every phone is different, and there can be more than one way to stop
these messages.

In Android, the Messages app is where you disable AMBER alerts. Just
look in the Settings under Emergency Alert Settings, where you can
enable or disable each category of emergency alert.
