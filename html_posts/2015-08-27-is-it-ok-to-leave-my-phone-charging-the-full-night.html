**Content:** [For the most part, batteries aren\'t as susceptible to
memory effect as they used to be. I\'ve killed many a Ni-Cd battery with
memory effect.\
\
Most of today\'s cell phones use Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion) batteries, while
some may be switching to Lithium-Polymer (Li-Po or LiPo) batteries.
These are very good at deterring memory effect, with the notable side
effect that they are not great at recovering from completely drained
cells. Much like the old Lead-Acid batteries we used in cars, Li-Ion
batteries do not like to be completely drained. It decreases their
useful life (i.e. the number of charge/discharge cycles the battery can
sustain). It\'s not a tremendous reduction, but it is a reduction
nonetheless.]{.rendered_qtext}
