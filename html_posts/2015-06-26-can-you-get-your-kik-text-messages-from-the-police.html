**Content:** [No. You\'d get them from the district attorney\'s office,
and only if your Kik texts were involved in a police investigation in
which the police seized your texts directly from Kik, with a judge\'s
warrant, and turned them over to the DA. You could then retrieve the
same information from the DA\'s office as part of the discovery phase of
the trial, so that you can use it to plan your defense.\
\
Otherwise, the police have less access to your Kik texts than you do.\
\
The police can\'t get your Kik texts, as I already mentioned, unless
they have a warrant]{.rendered_qtext}
