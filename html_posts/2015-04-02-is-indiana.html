**Content:** [There are businesses that think that it\'s okay to
discriminate against a class of people because of their own religious
beliefs.\
\
This is patently illegal, and no state law will ever legalize it.\
\
The law only allows a business to claim a religious exemption from
government programs. It has nothing to do with individual actions.\
\
It has everything to do with the government placing restrictions on a
business that violate the business owners\' religious beliefs.\
\
It has nothing to do with legalizing discrimination (although I\'m sure
that some business owners wanted it to do that).\
\
The Federal law was successfully used to defend Hobby Lobby from
provisions in the Affordable Care Act which violated the business
owners\' religious beliefs, and they were granted an exemption from
those provisions.\
\
There was some question that Indiana\'s RFRA might be a law that
legalizes discrimination because of some words in the law which were
slightly different from the Federal statute. It is very clear from what
the legislature and the governor said that this is not the spirit of the
law. These laws have existed for over 20 years, and it\'s very unlikely
that such an interpretation of this law would ever be made.\
\
If such a thing were to happen, I would hope that the entire state (if
not the entire country) came down on the governor and made sure that he
repealed the law (which he pledged to do if it was
misused).]{.rendered_qtext}
