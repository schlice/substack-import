The answer is "it depends."

However, if you signed a document indicating that the old HOA is
dissolving, the HOA is gone. You are no longer under an HOA. You would
have to sign a new document to form a new HOA.

An HOA is a legal entity. You can only create a mandatory HOA with 100%
of the homeowners agreeing to it. It is done by the developer because
they own 100% of the properties, so it makes it easy for them to do it.
But trying to create a new mandatory HOA would require 100% of the
homeowners to agree to it, or it's not mandatory.

The benefit of a "new" HOA after the old one dissolves is that you have
to agree to form it. If you do not, the HOA cannot be mandatory but
voluntary. You join if you want, you leave when you want.
