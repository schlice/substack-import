- Visit your local Force Support Squadron on base (formerly known as MWR
  --- morale, welfare, and recreation). They can help you find *all
  sorts* of things to do with your free time.
- Get a part-time job on base. There are lots of facilities that employ
  part-time off-duty airmen to work.
- You could, as you suggested, work on your degree, or work on an
  advanced degree.
