"all those in Quora who swear by freedom"

If you're referring to the pro-life people on Quora, we all, down to the
last person, swear by freedom.

But that means freedom for *everyone*. **Including the fetus**.

You are assuming that **bodily autonomy is unlimited**, and it is not.
Like every right we have, it is limited. Bodily autonomy is a right, up
until it impacts another right. That's its limit.

All of our rights are this way. You have the freedom to speak until your
speech starts to hurt others. You have the freedom to own and carry a
gun until that right starts to hurt others. And you have bodily autonomy
until that right starts to hurt others.

So if you claim to support rights equally, then you must claim that
**all rights are equal**, and the baby's right to live does not go away
just because the mother has bodily autonomy.
