**How do I get my Samsung Galaxy Note 4 to disable waking the screen
when I receive notifications from apps? I want the light to turn on, but
not the whole screen.**

There are several ways you can prevent the screen from turning on when
you receive notifications. Try them all out and see what works best for
you. Note that I'm not going to give you all the breadcrumbs through
Settings because the breadcrumbs are different depending on Android
version. You should be able to search Settings to find what you're
looking for. Or search Google for the feature and your Android version
and you'll find the breadcrumb trail to get you there.

1.  The setting you're really looking for is called *Ambient Display*
    settings and it's usually under Settings \> Display. You can turn
    that off, and then Android won't wake the display when you get a
    notification.
2.  You can modify how notifications for each app appear under Settings
    \> Notifications. You can enable/disable notifications for a
    specific app, or make them appear "silently" which means they will
    still show up in the notifications list, but they won't pop a
    notification onto the screen.
3.  More obscure would be to change how Gmail presents you with
    notifications (i.e. use the Priority Inbox) or how Email presents
    you with notifications (i.e. use the VIP setting), but these are a
    little more difficult to configure, and they are highly dependent on
    how you use email, and they do nothing for other alerts like
    Snapchat or SMS texts.
