The "sabbath" is the seventh day of the week. In a week that begins on
Sunday as the first day of the week, the sabbath would be Saturday. The
Bible is replete with examples, starting from Genesis, where God labored
for six days and rested on the seventh, and the Ten Commandments
commands us to do the same.

Both Jesus and the apostles observed the sabbath, and it wasn't until
long after Jesus and the apostles had left that anything began to
change.

The earliest authentic recognition of worshipping on Sunday began in
Italy, in the middle of the second century AD. For much of that time
then, Christians would rest on the Sabbath, and worship on Sunday, "the
Lord's Day." In other words, they observed ***both*** days.

It wasn't until Emperor Constantine that this practice was changed. On
March 7, 321 AD, Constantine issued the first civil Sunday law, which
commanded all those in the Roman Empire (except farmers) to rest on
Sunday. This, combined with five other pieces of legislation concerning
Sunday, became the very first legal precedent for resting and
worshipping on Sunday.

Then, in the 4th Century AD, the Council of Laodicea recommended to
Christians that they honor Sunday by abstaining from work on that day,
and prohibited them from abstaining from work on the Sabbath. This
officially marked the end of rest on the Sabbath and a transition to
resting and worshipping on Sunday.

But *why did they do this?*

The clear intent of the Council was to distinguish Christianity from
Judaism, and they strongly cautioned Christians to avoid "Judaizing" the
Sabbath. Jews worship on the seventh day, the Sabbath. Christians
worship on the eighth day of Creation, the Lord\'s Day, to commemorate
the day of the Resurrection. Basically, the logic says that if Christ
has fulfilled the law, we no longer need to keep the old laws. This is
why Christians do not celebrate the Passover, nor are they required by
their religion to be circumcised, etc. But when, then, do Christians
worship, if the law about keeping the Sabbath no longer has to be kept?
The answer is The Lord's Day, commemorating the day of Resurrection.
This is confirmed by Athanasius (who was a contemporary of the council
and probably took part), saying:

> The Sabbath was the end of the first creation, the Lord's day was the
> beginning of the second, in which he renewed and restored the old in
> the same way as he prescribed that they should formerly observe the
> Sabbath as a memorial of the end of the first things, so we honor the
> Lord's day as being the memorial of the new creation --- *On Sabbath
> and Circumcision* 3 \[A.D. 345\].
