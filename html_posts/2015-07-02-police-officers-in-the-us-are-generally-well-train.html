**Content:** [I missed the part in the police officer\'s job description
that says \"Gets killed when necessary.\" Police are there to stop
threats before they happen, not wait for them to happen and then try to
stop them.\
\
Sadly, a jurisdiction implemented a rule like this less than a month
ago. When a criminal is using a deadly weapon (a car), police officers
are **not allowed** to shoot at it. So criminals, take note: if you want
to kill a cop in Denver, use a car. They won\'t shoot at you if they\'re
following policy.\
\
*(NOTE: that last sentence was facetious and only meant as an
illustrative example; I am not advocating for anyone killing anyone.)*\
\
The thought behind the policy change is that they want officers to \"get
out of the way\" instead of shooting. And it was made after Denver
police killed a teenage car thief who was driving her car down an alley
(where they would not have been able to get out of the way) at the
officers. No charges were filed against the officers, who were (rightly)
in fear for their lives as a deadly weapon was being aimed at them.\
\
So let\'s think about this. Vehicle: routinely moves at 50 mph. Person:
routinely moves at 8 mph. Vehicle: around 3,000 lbs. Person: around 200
lbs. Any thoughts on which one will win?\
\
This policy change only happened last month, and thankfully no officers
have yet been killed because of it, but I sadly predict that day
coming.]{.rendered_qtext}
