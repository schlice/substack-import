**Do people with multiple sclerosis have ambivalence in sentiments or
even lack of sentiments?**

It sounds like you're asking whether or not MS can change your mood.

While the disease itself doesn't normally cause changes in mood, or mood
swings, the medications we take to control MS absolutely can.

Injectable medications are known to cause depression.

Being diagnosed with a lifelong incurable disease is also known to cause
depression.

Perhaps a little bit of compassion for those newly diagnosed or for
those struggling with their diagnosis is in order.
