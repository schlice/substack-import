**Is it legal for military forces to be used on US citizens?**

Under most circumstances, no. As others have mentioned, the Posse
Comitatus Act forbids it.

But there is one circumstance in which they can be engaged. If the fully
constituted forces of a state National Guard can\'t quell an
Insurrection, the governor can appeal to the President, and he can
activate the military under the Insurrection Act.
