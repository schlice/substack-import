There are two things that can help you: **treatment** and **medication**

I wholeheartedly recommend ***both*** of these options. Together. Not
alone.

The problem in the United States is, for the most part, that the people
who provide each one of those services are not one and the same.
Medication is provided by *psychiatrists,* medical doctors (MDs) who can
prescribe those medications. Treatment is usually provided by
*counselors* (licensed professional counselors - LPCs) or
*psychologists* (Ph.Ds). Most psychiatrists do not provide counseling
services, and most counselors and psychologists can't write
prescriptions.

Ideally, you'd want to find a pair or a team of these professionals who
work together. Often, if you talk to one, they can refer you to the
other with whom they can work to provide the missing piece of your
treatment.

You could also talk to your PCP (primary care provider - your regular
doctor) and see if there is any counselors he or she recommends. Then,
ask your doctor if they would act as your *prescribing physician* based
on the advice from the counselor. Note that your doctor and the
counselor would have to have a decent working relationship already
before they will do this. I suppose I was fortunate: my doctor
recommended a psychologist to me and agreed to work directly with him to
write any prescriptions I might need.

Find either a psychiatrist or a counselor/psychologist you like, and ask
them if they can recommend the other. That way, you are fully covered.

Medication alone is ineffective without treatment. Counseling is not as
effective as counseling and medication.

Get both.
