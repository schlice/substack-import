The correct answer is "it depends."

It depends on a few things:

1.  Who is doing the recording
2.  What is being recorded (audio, video, or both)
3.  Where you are located

For bullet 1, if you are the homeowner, you are generally legally
allowed to place cameras in common areas inside your own home and record
any activities that go on inside your home. Note that you are generally
prohibited from placing cameras in locations inside your home in which
there is an expectation of privacy, such as a bedroom or bathroom.

For bullet 2, you are generally allowed to record people in your own
home. Some states have some old phone-based laws which governed the
recording of audio between two callers which governed things like
notification (which parties had to know that the call was being
recorded), and some legal professionals believe these laws are still
applicable to audio recordings made by surveillance cameras, and they
may very well be. The law still needs to be modernized to catch up to
the technology.

For bullet 3, laws in some states vary with regard to what you can
record and when, and what sort of notification must be made before
someone enters an area which is under surveillance.
