This is all based on opinion, and I don't know you or your atheist
family member, and your family dynamic may have called for such an
action.

But just on a generic reading of this question, I'd have to question
that choice.

Did Jesus kick sinners out of his table? No, he dined with tax
collectors and prostitutes, the types of sinners that no one else would
associate with.

So if we are to be more like Jesus, we should be *welcoming* our family
members who are sinners rather than *shunning* them.

Original question:

Is it wrong that I kicked out my atheist family member during Easter
dinner because they wouldn\'t pray before eating?
