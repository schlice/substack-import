They are Constitutional when Congress *delegates* its tariff authority
to the President by passing laws to do so.

There are six statutory provisions (laws) currently in place that permit
the president and the executive branch to levy tariffs, along with
governing how those tariffs can be used. Three provisions require
federal agency investigations before a tariff can be imposed. The other
three provisions do not require an investigation before actions are
taken.

The three which require federal investigations before tariffs can be
imposed:

- Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. It authorizes the
  president to ask the Secretary of Commerce to determine if goods are
  being imported in a manner that threatens national security. The
  secretary then reports back to the president if he has any affirmative
  findings. "Section 232 does not require the President to follow the
  Secretary's recommendations but permits him to take alternative
  actions or no action," according to the [[Congressional Research
  Service](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c69de8&url=https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R48435){.external_link

  qt-tooltip="congress.gov"}]{.qlink_container} (CRS). Under Section
  232, there is no maximum time limit on the president's tariff actions.
  President Trump has already used this provision during both of his
  administrations to impose tariffs on both steel and aluminum imports.
- Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974. The act allows the president to
  impose tariffs if the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) finds
  that an import surge is threatening a U.S. domestic industry. If the
  ITC makes an affirmative determination, the president can take action
  accordingly, including placing tariffs. Tariffs imposed under Section
  201 are not meant to be permanent, and the actions have a limit of
  four to eight years.
- Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 allows the United States Trade
  Representative (USTR) to authorize tariffs on foreign countries that
  restrict U.S. commerce in "unjustifiable," "unreasonable," or
  "discriminatory" ways. If the USTR confirms such behavior after an
  investigation, the president has the discretion to allow the USTR to
  impose tariffs for at least four years.

Of the three provisions that allow the president to act on his own to
impose tariffs without an investigation, only the first has ever been
used:

- The International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977. This act
  allows the president to declare an emergency under the National
  Emergency Act (NEA) and then use his economic authority to regulate or
  prohibit imports. The CRS says that President Trump was the first
  chief executive to use this act in February 2025, when he announced
  tariffs on Canada, China, and Mexico. The state of emergency declared
  by the president can be terminated at his request, or by a joint
  resolution of Congress.
- Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 allows the president to enact
  temporary tariffs to address "large and serious United States
  balance-of-payments deficits" or \"fundamental international payments
  problems."
- Section 338 of Tariff Act of 1930 authorizes the president to enact
  "tariffs on articles produced by, or imported on the vessels of,
  foreign countries that discriminate against U.S. commerce in certain
  ways."

Congress could potentially "claw back" some of its authority by passing
new or updated legislation which limits presidential tariffs powers, or
it could even choose to expand the president's authority in the same
way. However, the CRS says that based on precedents dating back to the
time of Chief Justice Marshall, case law "has given the President broad
latitude to exercise his tariff authorities." Therefore, it is unlikely
that any of the President's tariff actions would be found to be
unconstitutional.
