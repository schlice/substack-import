In the US, why should COVID-19 be treated any different than any
ailment? Why aren't you asking, "Who should be responsible for
emphysema's medical costs?" "Who should be responsible for influenza's
medical costs?"

Are you trying to insinuate that someone *deliberately* infected you
with COVID-19 and now you want to make them responsible for your medical
costs?

If not, then why should someone else be responsible for your medical
care?
