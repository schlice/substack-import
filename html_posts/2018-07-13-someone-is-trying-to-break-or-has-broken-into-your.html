**Someone is trying to break, or has broken into your home or car. You
caught them in the act. You tell them to get on the ground until the
police arrive, or you will shoot. They run. You fire. Do you go to jail
for manslaughter?**

No, you will probably be charged with murder. You fired on (and
presumably killed) someone who was objectively not a threat to you, with
forethought and malice.

You might be able to get the charge reduced to manslaughter if you can
successfully argue against malicious intent, but you're definitely
facing a murder charge.
