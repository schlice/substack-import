**How do I know and identify undercover personnel on a commercial
airline flight?**

The bright yellow vests and bright yellow baseball caps emblazoned with
"UNDERCOVER OFFICER" all over them.

Beyond that, there's really no way to know who is the Air Marshall on
the plane.

That's the whole point of being, you know, "undercover."
