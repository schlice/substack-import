If you are unable to get someone to testify, you can make a request to
the Clerk of the Court to issue a subpoena for that person to appear and
to testify.

A subpoena is a **court order** to testify. How the subpoena is served
is determined by whether the case is a Federal or State case, and also
whether it is a judicial or administrative subpoena.

Regardless, the subpoena is served, and the person serving the subpoena
files an Affidavit of Service with the court. You'll have to pay
administrative fees as well as travel reimbursement (where applicable).
The Affidavit of Service proves that, to the extent required by law, the
person was notified that they have been subpoenaed and must appear in
court to testify.

If the summoned person fails to appear, the judge can issue a bench
warrant for their arrest.
