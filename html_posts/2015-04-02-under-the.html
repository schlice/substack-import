**Content:** [The *ex post facto* clause of the Constitution says that
Congress can\'t write an ex post facto law (a law which has retroactive
effects, or a law which criminalizes, or increases penalties on, a crime
which has already been committed). Interestingly, this was also applied
directly to the states in the Contstitution as well, one of the only
times that the Constitution actually put a restriction on the states
before the 14th Amendment was passed. We define criminal acts as those
that violated the law **at the time in which the crime was committed**.
Therefore, we can\'t write an ex post facto criminal law and criminalize
an activity that was legal at the time it was committed, or add
qualifiers or modifiers that would change the criminality of an act that
was already committed.]{.rendered_qtext}
