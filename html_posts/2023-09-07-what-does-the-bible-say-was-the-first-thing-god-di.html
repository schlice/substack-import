The first thing that God did after creating everything was *to see that
it was good.*

> *God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. --- Genesis 1:31
> NIV*

.

> Why did He do this thing before anything else on Earth/at all?

When God said that His creation was good, He was affirming its original
design and intent. The creation was meant to reflect and display God\'s
good character, power, and nature. In its original state, the creation
met God\'s standards.

Ensuring that your hard work met your standards is a great example to
set for the rest of creation.
