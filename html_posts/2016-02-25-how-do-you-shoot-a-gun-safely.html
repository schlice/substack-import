It\'s actually quite simple to shoot a gun. Young or old, it\'s a simple
mechanical tool.

I\'m not quite sure what you mean by \"shooting safely.\" Are you asking
how do you shoot and only hit your intended target, or how do you shoot
without injuring yourself? In order to shoot and only hit your intended
target, you need practice. In order to shoot without injuring yourself,
follow the true definition of gun control: \"using both hands to hold
your gun.\" Remember, it\'s a controlled explosion going off in your
hands and is always a little startling, no matter how many times you do
it.
