Ah yes, free will. God did, in fact, give us free will. He allows us to
choose to either love Him or reject Him. Just ask any atheist. They'd
love to tell you exactly why they have chosen to reject Him. That's a
poignant example of our free will.

What those atheists have told me (and I only partially believe them) is
that *God just isn't forceful enough* in making His presence known to
them in order for them to believe. They are like Thomas on steroids.
Thomas said that he wouldn't believe Jesus rose from the dead until he
touched the nail holes in Jesus' hands and put his hand in Jesus' side
where the spear pierced Him. And when Jesus did come back the next time
the disciples were all gathered in the upper room, Thomas *did* touch
the holes, and he *did believe*.

The atheists' problem is that even though God has left abundant evidence
of His existence, He has also left just enough ambiguity so as to not
coerce the unwilling. For love can only be freely given; it can never be
coerced.

That's all well and good, but Jesus did say He is coming back, and the
angel said that Jesus would return *in the same way the disciples saw
Him leave*. Jesus was **assumed** into Heaven. That means, when He
returns, He will ***descend*** from Heaven. Imagine that being broadcast
on every social media channel and every major news outlet in existence,
with firsthand eyewitness accounts of Jesus descending from Heaven.

Will the atheists believe in Him at that point? Some will, but others
will say it's all Hollywood magic or some kind of secret government
levitation suit. But eventually, Jesus is going to do stuff on earth,
stuff that was foretold in Revelation. And at that point, ***free will
is out the door***.

You had your chance to believe freely. You had your chance to be like
Thomas, and touch the nail holes and believe, but you blew it.
Eventually, ***every knee will bow, and every tongue will confess that
Jesus is Lord*** (Philippians 2:10--11), even if they did so
*begrudgingly.*

But if they did begrudgingly bend the knee, probably even still deriding
Jesus while being forced to believe in His existence, ***woe to them.
Woe to those who were forced to believe. They will discover the hard way
that God is, in fact, real, and eternity is an awfully long time to have
made the wrong choice.*** Those people will not share in the same
eternity as those who "did not see and yet believed." They will shuffle
off to Hell knowing that Jesus is real, and they exercised their free
will poorly.

So this actually ***confirms*** that free will does exist, because it
proves that there are indeed consequences for our choices.
