**Content:** [This isn\'t a question we can yet answer. It\'s like
asking \"is it true that white lab coats causes cancer in laboratory
animals?\" It\'s not a question we can answer because it simply hasn\'t
been discovered yet.\
\
We don\'t yet know the cause of Multiple Sclerosis, althogh there are
some good ideas. We know that women get MS at a rate of two to three
times that of men, so we know that there is some hormonology involved.
To what extent, and how, that works, is still being investigated.\
\
There are other factors as well: ethnicity, geography of childhood,
genetics, and that all-important and as-of-yet undiscovered
environmental trigger (likely a virus) that all play into whether or not
someone will develop MS.]{.rendered_qtext}
