**Why does this conversation between Trump and the Ukranian President
constitute an impeachable offense, rather than just exercising his
constitutional authority to conduct foreign policy?**

It doesn't.

- The President did not ask for Ukraine to interfere with an election.
- The President did not ask for dirt on a political opponent.
- The President did not offer "quid pro quo" or money in return for
  doing anything.

What the President did do was to ask Ukraine to work with his Department
of Justice and his personal defense attorney to investigate some
inappropriate behavior surrounding the 2016 Presidential election. He is
literally doing what Congress has been doing with the Mueller probe for
two years, but now because Trump asked for it, somehow it's impeachable?

I say, if the Democrats think they have enough evidence to warrant
impeachment proceedings, bring it on. It will literally only guarantee a
Trump 2020 victory, and the Democrats may lose the House. People are
starting to see all of this impeachment talk as a waste of time and
taxpayer dollars when Congress could be passing laws.
