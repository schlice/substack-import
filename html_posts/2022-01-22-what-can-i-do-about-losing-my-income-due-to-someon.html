You said that this person who recognized you actually works at your
psychiatrist's office, where you are a patient.

If this is true, and that person told your co-workers that you are a
patient at his of her office, they have most likely violated HIPAA
privacy laws.

I would speak to an attorney in your local area who specializes in HIPAA
or medical practice. Sounds like you may have a case for a HIPAA
violation.
