Not even close.

First, in order to understand the Bible, we use the Bible to interpret
the Bible in a process called *exegesis*. We do this first by using
*context* of the verse, then of the chapter, then of the book, then the
whole Bible. **For text, without context, is just pretext.**

So let's broaden our scope to the immediate context:

> On the evening of that first day of the week, when the disciples were
> together, with the doors locked for fear of the Jewish leaders, Jesus
> came and stood among them and said, "Peace be with you!" After he said
> this, he showed them his hands and side. The disciples were overjoyed
> when they saw the Lord.
>
> Again Jesus said, "Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I am
> sending you." And with that he breathed on them and said, "Receive the
> Holy Spirit. If you forgive anyone's sins, their sins are forgiven; if
> you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven." --- John 20:19--23
> NIV

So what's the context here? Jesus has risen and He appears to the
disciples in the locked upper room. He tells them in verse 21, "**As the
Father sends me, I am sending you.**" *This context is important. We'll
get to why in just a minute.*

Then, He breathed on them, giving them the Holy Spirit. He tells them
(in the verse you are asking about), "If you forgive anyone's sins,
their sins are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not
forgiven."

So what did He mean by that? Did He mean that the disciples could judge
what was sin and what was not sin? Did He mean that, by extension, you
can judge for yourself what is sin and what is not sin? Did it mean that
the disciples could run out into the street tagging people like playing
Duck Duck Goose saying, "Forgiven, forgiven, forgiven, UNFORGIVEN!,
forgiven..."

NO! Verse 21 interprets verse 23. Remember that Jesus says, "As the
Father sends me, I am sending you." The disciples will forgive *just as*
Christ has forgiven. How has Christ forgiven? On the basis of His death
and resurrection, and to be received by faith. How should the disciples
forgive? On the basis of Christ\'s death and resurrection, and to be
received by faith. So as the disciples declare Christ and His
forgiveness in the power of the Spirit, the world\'s response to their
message will be its response to Christ (which, in turn, is its response
to the Father).

So no, the disciples didn't have the power to forgive sins. Only God
forgives sins. The disciples have the power to declare Christ and His
forgiveness in the power of the Spirit, *as all Christians are
commissioned to do*. The person hearing the disciples can respond in
faith and God can forgive their sins.
