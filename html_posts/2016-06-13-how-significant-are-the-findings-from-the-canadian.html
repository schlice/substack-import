This is a very radical therapy option. It's something that we have known
about for many years.

The findings are significant in the sense that it shows that autologous
hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) may potentially have some
benefit in patients with Multiple Sclerosis.

It is, however, only a Phase 1 study, which means that it was only
tested against a very small group of patients for safety. There are
significant safety concerns with a therapy like this, since it is so
very radical.

To clarify, in order to accomplish this therapy, the patient's immune
cells are harvested and then duplicated in a lab. Next, the patient's
entire immune system and bone marrow is destroyed using chemotherapy.
Finally, the patient's harvested and reproduced immune cells are
re-introduced to the patient to grow new bone marrow.

The patient is at great risk during the therapy, and an extended
hospital stay is required. Slow re-introduction to normal society is
also required, since the person will essentially have no immunities
following the treatment. Re-population of all previous immunities will
need to be done; essentially, all vaccinations that you would normally
receive as a baby will need to be performed again, from scratch.

Therefore, because of the significant risks in performing such a
procedure, it is only something that would currently be recommended for
someone who is not responding to any therapy we can currently provide.
Until the procedure can be refined and made to be more safe, it will
only be something we relegate to the most severe cases in which no other
therapy has been effective.
