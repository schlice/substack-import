**Could Trump take big money donors on Air Force One for a couple of
hours, if he covered the operating costs?**

Not for a joy-ride, but if passengers are traveling on AF1, they must
pay commercial-equivalent airfare for the trip. The RNC can certainly
pick up that tab if they choose, but that fare will not be paid for by
taxpayers.

He can't just put the plane in the air, circle it around for a while and
then land it. That would be a waste of money and wouldn't be tolerated
by internal or external watchdog groups.
