**Content:** [The chances are not very good.\

You can buy badges from any number of places. ID cards, however, are
much harder to fake. Unless you\'ve seen the agency\'s ID cards before,
you\'re not likely to be able to tell a fake from a real ID card.\

You can always call 911 and ask the dispatcher to assist you with
identifying the officer. It should only take a few minutes, and these
days a plainclothes officer or detective should allow you that luxury.
There is no set policy, usually, around doing this, but I would expect a
plainclothes officer would understand if someone is
wary.]{.rendered_qtext}
