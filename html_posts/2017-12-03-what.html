**What\'s President Trump doing about the illegals who abuse the system,
go home to their native countries and come back to the U.S. and start
the cycle anew?**

For starters, he's tough on immigration. Even without the wall in place,
illegals know that illegally entering a country run by a president tough
on immigration is no fun place to be. This is evidenced by the fact that
illegal immigration is way down since Trump took office, and he hasn't
even finished the wall yet!

Secondly, he's building a wall. I know people love to trot out the tired
tropes about a multi-billion dollar wall thwarted by a \$10 ladder, but
it's tough to get a semi truck full of drugs over a wall with a ladder.
It slows down illegal immigration immensely rather than leaving large
swaths of land available for people to cross at their leisure. You don't
have large groups of illegal immigrants moving freely across your border
when you have a wall. Evidence and history show that walls slow down
illegal immigration.

He's also directing ICE agents to enforce the law. He's increasing
border patrol funding, putting more agents on the front lines, and
directing the agency to do the job it's been Constitutionally directed
to do. He's working on getting chain migration repealed, and he is also
working on getting birth citizenship amended to state that it only
applies to parents who are citizens. You shouldn't be able to illegally
cross the border, drop a kid while on our side of the border, have that
kid become a citizen, and then have the rest of their home village
become citizens through chain migration. For reference, chain migration
is the process that is enabled when citizens and legal permanent
residents are allowed to sponsor non-nuclear family members into the
country. Reports have shown that [[more than 70 percent of immigrants
came from chain
migration](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cf70b7&url=http://dailycaller.com/2017/12/01/more-than-70-percent-of-immigrants-came-from-chain-migration/){.external_link
