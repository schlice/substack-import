Logically, in order to create time, God must exist outside of time. In
order to create space, God must exist outside of space. In order to
create matter and energy, God must exist outside of matter and energy.
Because those things cannot exist before they existed.

These things don't make sense to us, because our brains are incapable of
understanding how something can exist outside of matter and energy, time
and space. Even when we say that God existed before the universe, the
word "before" implies time, when time wasn't created until the Big Bang.
It makes no sense to us.

But logically speaking, it nevertheless must be true. Nothing exists
before it existed. Except for God, who is outside of time, and is
therefore *eternal*.

This is where the Christian has *faith*. Faith bridges the gap between
the **undeniable** and the **unknowable**. We will never be able to
understand how God can exist beyond matter and energy, time and space.
But faith is the force which allows us to move forward without complete
understanding. It's knowable beyond a *reasonable* doubt, not beyond
*all* doubt. Faith gets us to the answer, even when some doubt remains.

And this separates the wheat from the chaff. Only those *willing* to
have faith will actually believe. Those who are unwilling will not.
*Which is precisely what God wants*. He only wants the willing in His
new kingdom. When you have faith, when you believe beyond what you can
possibly ever know, it is your willingness to believe which will be
rewarded.
