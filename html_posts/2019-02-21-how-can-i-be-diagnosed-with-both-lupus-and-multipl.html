**How can I be diagnosed with both Lupus and Multiple sclerosis?**

Great question. While they are both autoimmune diseases, they both cause
distinct symptoms which are generally not seen in the other disease.
Signs and symptoms from both diseases may lead to a finding of both
lupus and MS.

CAUSE OF SYMPTOMS: In both diseases, the immune system attacks healthy,
normal body tissue. In Lupus, actual body tissues like skin, lungs,
heart and kidneys, are attacked. In MS, the myelin sheath surrounding
nerve fibers in the CNS is attacked.

SYMPTOMS: Lupus produces symptoms such as:

- Fatigue
- Fever
- Joint pain, stiffness and swelling
- Butterfly-shaped rash on the face that covers the cheeks and bridge of
  the nose or rashes elsewhere on the body
- Skin lesions that appear or worsen with sun exposure
  (photosensitivity)
- Fingers and toes that turn white or blue when exposed to cold or
  during stressful periods (Raynaud\'s phenomenon)
- Shortness of breath
- Chest pain
- Dry eyes
- Headaches, confusion and memory loss

MS produces symptoms such as:

- Bladder Dysfunction
- Bowel Dysfunction
- Changes in Cognitive Function, including problems with memory,
  attention, and problem-solving
- Dizziness and Vertigo
- Depression and other Emotional Changes
- Fatigue (also called MS lassitude)
- Difficulty in Walking and/or Balance or Coordination Problems
- Abnormal sensations such as Numbness or "pins and needles"
- Sexual Dysfunction
- Spasticity
- Vision Problems (Optic Neuritis)

Less common symptoms include:

- Headache
- Hearing Loss
- Itching
- Seizures
- Speech Disorders
- Dysphagia (Swallowing Problems)
- Tremor

DIAGNOSIS: MS diagnosis is usually made by using an MRI to scan the
brain and spinal cord, along with a neurological exam. The lesions
caused by the disease process are visible on an MRI. Lupus is diagnosed
with a combination of blood and urine tests, as well as the physical
examination findings, including the signs and symptoms.

TREATMENT: There is no medication available which specifically targets
the disease activity of lupus. A combination of NSAIDs, corticosteroids,
immunosuppressants and biologics may be used to ease lupus symptoms.
Approved MS therapy drugs slow down the progress of the disease, while
reducing the severity and duration of relapses. Secondary medications
may be used during relapses to help control the symptoms.
