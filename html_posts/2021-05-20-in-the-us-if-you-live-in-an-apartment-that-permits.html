A dog barking is a natural thing. Even in an apartment complex.

And as everyone is aware, most cities and localities have noise
ordinances which prohibit excessive noise between certain hours (usually
11 PM and 7 AM local time, but may be different where you live).

That all said, *what about the times during the rest of the day?*

It's expected that you'll hear things in apartment complexes, including
barking dogs.

But a dog barking *constantly*, for four to six hours a day, is a
*disturbance*.

Start by addressing the tenant directly. Usually dogs bark like this
when no one is home. Perhaps they are bored. Perhaps they are nervous.
Regardless, the tenant may not know what is happening at home while he
or she is gone. So step one is to talk to them, calmly and
neighbor-like. There are interventions which can be implemented to help
fix whatever is causing the dog to bark. The tenant can check in with
the dog using technology. There are automated dog toys which can help to
entertain a bored dog. There's plenty which can be done. Maybe the
tenant may want to consider doggy day-care. It's actually very
reasonably priced.

If you get no joy from that, call the landlord. The landlord should take
action to minimize the issue.

If they do not, feel free to call Animal Control or your local police
department, and file a complaint for disturbing the peace.

**In the U.S., if you live in an apartment that permits dogs, does that
mean that they\'re allowed to disturb you with their barking and
howling?**
