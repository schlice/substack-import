My vision recovered to the point where the ON was no longer a
significant factor after about 4 months. It generally takes anywhere
from 3 to 6 months for ON to resolve itself, but it can be shorter, or
even significantly longer.

Depending on the cause of the ON, symptoms can remain for a significant
period following the onset of the condition.
