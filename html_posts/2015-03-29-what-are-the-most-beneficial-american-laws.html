**Content:** [One of the most impactful pieces of legislation in our
time is the Americans with Disabilities Act. This massive law affected
many different aspects of our society, including the availability of
handicapped parking spaces, accessible bathroom facilities, ramps and
elevators, automatic doors, and related items.\
\
It also changed the way businesses hire employees, to allow for more
fairness in hiring the disabled. It changed what businesses are allowed
to ask when hiring an individual; they can only list the requirements of
the job and can ask the prospective employee whether or not they can
perform those essential job functions \"with or without reasonable
accommodations.\" If they answer yes, the prospective employee is
affirming that they physically and mentally meet the requirements of the
job.\
\
An employee does not have to disclose to his/her employer that he/she is
disabled. That information stays between the doctor, the patient, and
the insurance company. The employee will have to disclose if they seek
accommodations, but otherwise, they can keep their disability to
themselves. There is a presumption, of course, that the disability does
not preclude the individual from actually performing the job. The
requirements of the job should list what is required in order to ensure
that the disabled person can actually accomplish the requirements.\
\
This was one of the biggest advances for the disabled in recent years,
and has led to many more people with disabilities being valued in the
workplace not because of their disability, but in spite of it; for their
**ability**.\
\
Of course, with all of the upsides, there are downsides. The presumption
that disabled people are telling the truth about their disability leads
to some abuse of the system. If you claim to have a disability, you
can\'t be asked to provide proof that you actually have that disability.
If you bring a dog into a restaurant and claim that it is a service dog,
you don\'t have to show proof that the service dog is actually trained
to perform any specific function; you have to take the disabled
person\'s word for it. And there is very little that can be done if
someone abuses the system, claiming a disability and receiving
accommodations when they don\'t actually have a disability. One big
exception is in parking spaces and claiming to have a disability when
you don\'t. This can result in fines and suspension/revocation of your
license. But since in most business cases the accommodations provided
are not onerous, there\'s not much that the business can do to redress
those grievances against someone who lies about having a
disability.]{.rendered_qtext}
