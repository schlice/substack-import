**How would I go about changing mobile network and buying a new mobile
plan if I am under 18?**

There are few people under 18 who are paying their own way these days.
Few have a job that allows them to sign up with a carrier on their own
without their parents' assistance.

But if you do, good for you! You are an enterprising individual, and
you'll do well in whatever you decide to do.

If you can show the carrier that you make a steady income, you should be
able to sign up for a wireless plan on your own.

That said, however, in order to *enter into a contract* with a wireless
carrier, you have to be 18. If you are under 18 (between 13 and 17 for
most US carriers), you will need permission from your parent or guardian
to enter into a contract.
