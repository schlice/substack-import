**Content:** [No. The only persons who can park in a handicapped spot
are persons who have been issued a handicapped hang tag or license plate
by the DMV. Those are issued when a doctor has verified an issue which
limits mobility. It may not be a visible issue.\
\
Generally, having a baby does not impair one\'s mobility to such a
degree that they would qualify for a handicap tag, but that call is made
by the doctor. The mother must have a medical condition caused by
childbirth that so limits mobility that they qualify for handicap
parking.]{.rendered_qtext}
