title: "Is being gay a sin? I have heard people both strongly side with yes and strongly side with no. If it is a sin, why? Where in the Bible does it say that being gay is bad? I thought we were supposed to love everyone, so why does it matter the gender?"

As with similar questions on Quora, people are not being precise enough
with this question.

**Having homosexual temptations is not a sin.\
Allowing those temptations to turn into something else (either sinful
thoughts or sinful acts) is sin.**

This is no different for the homosexual than it is for the heterosexual.
Look at the example of King David in the Bible. He went out on his
rooftop terrace one night at the palace, and he saw a woman, Bathsheba,
taking a bath on an adjacent rooftop, *and she was beautiful*. David
lusted after her, and after he took her, he killed her husband to cover
up his crime. This is chronicled in 2 Samuel if you want to read it
yourself.

The mechanism of sin is virtually the same for everyone, and it looks
just like David: **I saw, I wanted, I took, I hid.** The old adage is
definitely appropriate here: *the eyes are the window to the soul.* What
the eyes see can invade your soul and influence your actions.

Seeing Bathsheba was an accident, a temptation. That alone was not sin.
David sinned **when he didn't look away**. When he kept looking at her
and allowing his juices to get flowing, he fell into desire, and
desiring something which is not ours to desire is the sin of *lust*.

The pattern is no different for us. I saw, I wanted, I took, I hid. The
seeing is an accident, designed to tempt you to sin (and it is designed,
but not by God), but is not actually sin. Allowing yourself to proceed
further into *desiring something that is against God's will* is the sin.

What I'm saying here is that there is a very bright-line delineation
between **temptation** and **sin**. Just having homosexual temptations
is not a sin, and is a function of our fallen nature. Allowing that
temptation to proceed to desire *is* the sin. Seeing the fork in the
road is not a sin. Allowing the mind to think about what it would be
like to go down the sinful path, *and then proceeding down the sinful
path*, is.

> I thought we were supposed to love everyone, so why does it matter the
> gender?

We are supposed to love everyone. We're not supposed to have sex with
everyone. I think that's a fairly straightforward distinction to make.
