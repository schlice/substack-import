The simple fact that the land is "public" does not make squatting legal.
The land is still owned by a local jurisdiction, then made available for
public use.

We had a problem recently with homeless camps until the city cracked
down on them, passing a citywide ordinance which states that overnight
camping may only take place in designated camping areas, and that public
land was not designated camping area. Special permits could be obtained
from the city for camping on public land, but homeless camps were not
one of the approved reasons you could obtain a permit.

And yes, violation of the law can result in arrest.
