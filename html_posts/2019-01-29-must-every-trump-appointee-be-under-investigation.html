**Must every Trump appointee be under investigation? Brett Kavanaugh
\'likely\' to be investigated for perjury.**

Brett Kavanaugh cannot be impeached for perjury, because he wasn't on
the Supreme Court during the time he supposedly perjured himself.

The Constitution says that Supreme Court justices "shall hold their
offices during good behavior" and this is taken to mean that behavior
***before*** they held their offices does not count towards their
impeachment. Only behavior *while they hold their offices* is
impeachable.

So unless someone is going to argue that Kavanaugh perjured himself
*while on the Court*, then Constitutionally he cannot be impeached for
perjuring himself before he was on the court. He wasn't actually *on the
court* until he was approved by the Senate and sworn in by the
President; therefore, his nomination hearings do not apply to perjury
charges.

Therefore, he can't be impeached for any alleged perjury during his
nomination hearings.

And yes, every Trump appointee must be investigated because Orange Man
