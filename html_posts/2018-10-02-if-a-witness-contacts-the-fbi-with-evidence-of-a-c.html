**If a witness contacts the FBI with evidence of a crime (like perjury
before the Congress), isn\'t the agency obligated to investigate,
regardless of the instructions they are given by the White House?**

No. The FBI can decide whether or not they choose to investigate any
alleged crime. In any case, if a crime is brought to the attention of
the FBI, either by a witness or a victim, the FBI will perform an
initial investigation to determine if a crime has been committed (i.e.
has the alleged incident actually met the essential elements of a
Federal crime), and who committed this crime. In the case of lying to
Congress, it must be Congress that refers the charge to the FBI, as they
are considered the "victim."

In the specific crime you are discussing (lying to Congress), there are
two separate crimes we can discuss: "knowingly and willfully giving
materially false statements to Congress" which does not need to be done
under oath, and a general "perjury (lying under oath)" charge.

The crime of lying to Congress is really difficult to prove. First, you
have to prove that the lie was "knowingly and willfully" given. This
means that the alleged liar knew the right answer, and intentionally
gave a false answer with intent to derail an investigation or to mislead
the Congress. Then, the "materiality" portion of the law kicks in. The
statement has to be materially important to Congress' work; it can't
just be an omission of fact which was "accidentally" given, or was a
"mistake" in fact, in any ancillary statement. It actually has to be
part of what Congress was primarily investigating through the testimony.

If the FBI reviews the claim and finds that it can't easily establish
any of the essential elements of the crime, they are not going to bother
to investigate.

Just because it is difficult to prove doesn't mean that it hasn't been
done before. John Poindexter was sentenced to prison for lying to
Congress when he testified about key details of the Iran-Contra affair.
He was later pardoned.
