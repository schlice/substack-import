<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [We had a traveling groomer who worked out of an RV. He had
a gas that he would use for my troublemaker cat. When that cat was
breathing that gas, he\'d sleep. We could trim his nails and brush the
knots out of his fur which he wouldn\'t let us do when he was awake.
He\'d wake up, be more mad with us than usual, and go on about his
life.\
\
This cat got groomed more than my dog.\
\
But it\'s what we had to do.]{.rendered_qtext}
