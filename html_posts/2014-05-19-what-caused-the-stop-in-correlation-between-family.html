The shape and the face of the workforce will always change with demand.
That is the simple truth of a free market economy. The skills that are
in the highest demand will always receive the highest salaries. This is
true in an individual company as well as in an economy in general.\
\
I can only assume that the definition of fairness in this context
relates to the fact that some previously-valued job is no longer so. If
that is the case, I will tell you the same thing I tell my kids: life is
not fair. You don\'t really want fairness, I tell them. When they ask
why, I say that if one of them gets in trouble and I have to punish him,
then in order to be \"fair\" I have to punish everyone. You share the
victories, but you also share the defeats. That\'s about when they
realize that no one really wants fair. What they really want is equity,
not equality. Equality means fairness of outcome. Equity means fairness
of opportunity.\
\
This country and our economic system were founded on fairness of
opportunity (everyone has the same opportunity to excel). The tenor of
the question seems to indicate that the asker would prefer fairness of
outcome (everyone ends up with the same outcome, regardless of
performance). On the pendulum of capitalism vs socialism, capitalism is
fairness of opportunity and socialism is fairness of
outcome.]{.rendered_qtext}
