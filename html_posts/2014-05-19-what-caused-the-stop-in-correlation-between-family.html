<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Piggybacking on Ty\'s answer.\<br>\<br>The shape and the face of the workforce will always change with demand.<br>That is the simple truth of a free market economy. The skills that are<br>in the highest demand will always receive the highest salaries. This is<br>true in an individual company as well as in an economy in general.\<br>\<br>I can only assume that the definition of fairness in this context<br>relates to the fact that some previously-valued job is no longer so. If<br>that is the case, I will tell you the same thing I tell my kids: life is<br>not fair. You don\'t really want fairness, I tell them. When they ask<br>why, I say that if one of them gets in trouble and I have to punish him,<br>then in order to be \"fair\" I have to punish everyone. You share the<br>victories, but you also share the defeats. That\'s about when they<br>realize that no one really wants fair. What they really want is equity,<br>not equality. Equality means fairness of outcome. Equity means fairness<br>of opportunity.\<br>\<br>This country and our economic system were founded on fairness of<br>opportunity (everyone has the same opportunity to excel). The tenor of<br>the question seems to indicate that the asker would prefer fairness of<br>outcome (everyone ends up with the same outcome, regardless of<br>performance). On the pendulum of capitalism vs socialism, capitalism is<br>fairness of opportunity and socialism is fairness of<br>outcome.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
