This is an interesting question, because without evidence (or probable
cause to believe that the person arrested actually committed the assault
alleged), then the arrest would be thrown out.

Is it *illegal* to make such an arrest? Technically, it is not illegal
for a police officer to make such an arrest *assuming he was acting in
good faith with the information he had at hand.*

If the officer *knowingly* made an arrest without probable cause and not
acting in good faith, the arrest, while not a crime in and of itself,
would become the topic of a civil rights violation lawsuit, where such
causes of action as "false arrest" would be levied.

If the police were to arrest a person without probable cause, based on
mistaken identity, through police misconduct, through unlawful searches
and seizures, or through coerced false testimony, that officer and that
department could be sued for false arrest.
