We don't need a right to life in the Bill of Rights. We already declared
in the Declaration of Independence that we have an unalienable right to
life:

> We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created
> equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
> Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of
> Happiness

I know what you're thinking. If we have this right to life in the
Declaration of Independence and we acknowledge that it is *unalienable*
(which means that we cannot divest ourselves of this right even if we
choose to do so), how were we able to allow abortion?

Note that nothing in the Declaration of Independence discusses *when
life begins*.

*Roe v. Wade* unequivocally determined that life begins at birth. In
allowing abortions as it does, it declared that fetuses are not
guaranteed the right to life that other citizens are. This means that
until they are born, they do not possess "life" as it is defined in the
Declaration, and therefore are not endowed with that right until then.

Perhaps you should re-word your question to ask, "How would the US be
different if a declaration of when life begins was in the Bill of
Rights?" That question would pose an entirely different set of
circumstances, and would be an interesting thought experiment.

But repeating what we already have in the Declaration of Independence
would be redundant and unnecessary in the framework of the Bill of
Rights.
