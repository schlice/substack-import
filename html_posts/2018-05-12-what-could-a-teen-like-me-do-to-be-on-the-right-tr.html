**What could a teen like me do to be on the right track to join the Air
Force, specifically food and activity-wise?**

It's really simple: eat right and exercise. Stay away from junk food and
sugar, eat more meat and veg than carb, etc. Make sure you're
participating in some form of aerobic activity no less than three days a
week for at least 30 minutes each time. Try to throw a little strength
training in there on the opposite days.

Ideally, you'll want to build stamina, so some easy over-distance
jogging would not be terrible.

If you're doing the right things to take care of yourself now, the Air
Force will shape you into the Airman they want you to be, so don't worry
about that part too much. Just stay healthy, avoid the dumb mistakes
that teens sometimes make, and you'll be ready to go.

Good luck!
