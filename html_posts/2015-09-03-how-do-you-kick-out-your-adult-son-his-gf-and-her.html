**Content:** [You show them the mortgage document with your name on it,
and not theirs.\
\
As long as they don\'t own the house along with you, legally you are not
required to allow them to live there without a rental agreement. And you
may not be able to sublet your house depending on the neighborhood
zoning laws in place, so you may not even be legally allowed to rent
them a room.\
\
Legally, they are considered guests in your house, staying there at your
pleasure.\
\
I don\'t know why you are kicking them out, but if these people are
adults (your son and his girlfriend), then you are under no obligation
to house them in your home. That requirement ended when your son reached
the age of majority. His girlfriend and her child are not related to
anyone in your house, so they are literally guests as well, and have
been so from the moment you allowed them to stay.\
\
They stay as long as you allow them to stay. They leave when you tell
them to leave. It is your house, not theirs.\
\
The worst part of the situation is when you will have to call the police
to come out and \"escort\" them off of your property because they refuse
to leave. You can pretty much bet that will be the last time you see
them.]{.rendered_qtext}
