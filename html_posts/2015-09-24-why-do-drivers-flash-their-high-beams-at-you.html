**Content:** [To follow with the theme of \"flashing lights alert you to
a road hazard ahead,\" my USAFA grad colleagues will remember this from
their days at The Hill.\
\
The Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado, is also designated
as an animal refuge. As a consequence, the local fauna (specifically
mule deer) flourish on the 18,000 acre campus (second largest in the
United States). Deer strikes are the most common auto accident that
takes place on the Academy, more common than off-base. The base does an
annual hunt to try to control the population, but the population still
grows at a faster pace than off-base.\
\
Consequently, it is well known that if a driver flashes his lights at
you on Academy property, you are likely approaching deer in the road or
near the road.]{.rendered_qtext}
