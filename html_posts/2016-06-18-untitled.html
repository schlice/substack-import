Dan, more than CNN, more than Fox News, more than any other news source,
I can count on you to provide an answer that is reasoned, thoughtful,
and more likely than not, much closer to the actual answer. You know
that there's always three sides to every argument: his side, your side,
and the truth, which is usually somewhere in between. No one gets the
truth exactly right, because our perception is colored by the life
experiences we carry with us. In other words, we all see life through
our own glasses, colored by our life experiences. I have found that your
answers seem to land closer to the truth than anyone else's. Thanks
again for that.
