Short answer is no.

If there is no report to the police, the District Attorney has not made
a case against the person. If there is no case, the judge has no basis
to issue a bench warrant against which the person should appear in his
courtroom. If there is no reason for the person to be summoned to the
court, there is no reason for the judge to issue a warrant.
