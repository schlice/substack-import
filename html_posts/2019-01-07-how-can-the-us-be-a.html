**How can the US be a \"nation of laws\" rather than a tyranny of
men/women when it supposedly was lawfully constituted via a \"social
contract\" under which an offeree is bound regardless of whether the
offeree actually accepted the offer?**

What is the mechanism under which you accept the offer?

Have you ever seen this sign, or a sign like this?

:::: ui_qtext_image_outer

By your mere presence in the facility with this sign posted, you give
your consent to being recorded.

This is part of a larger doctrine called **implied consent.**

The "social contract" is another form of implied consent.

By living as a citizen in a "nation of laws," you give implied consent
to being subservient to those laws. By choosing, freely, to live as a
citizen of the nation, your consent to abide by the laws of that nation
is implied.

Before you turned 18, your parents gave your implied consent on your
behalf. By remaining a citizen of the state after your 18th birthday,
your own personal consent is implied.
