**If stopped by police, can someone invoke their right to remain silent
if asked to perform a sobriety test? After being taken to the station,
if you demand a lawyer when they insist on the breathalyzer, will that
be used against you?**

Two questions in one.

First question (paraphrased): can you refuse to perform a sobriety test?
The answer is **yes** you can.

However, what does that mean? The answer varies by state, but in most
states, the decision to not perform a FST (field sobriety test) will
have consequences. The officer will use the information he already has
to make a determination on whether or not you are impaired.

You can also refuse the portable breathalyzer. The outcome will be the
same: the officer will use his or her best judgement to determine
whether or not you are too impaired to drive.

However, while you can refuse the stationary breathalyzer at the police
station, the consequences are much different. You have essentially
already consented to the breathalyzer at the police station when you
signed for your license in what's called "implied consent." Therefore,
refusing the breath test means you are willingly giving up your driving
privilege, since you already agreed to the breath test as a condition of
getting your license. Refusing the breath test means your license can be
suspended. Most states will automatically suspend your license for 12
months for refusing to take a breath test (if you're a frequent flyer,
you may be suspended for longer).

Second question (also paraphrased): can you demand a lawyer when you are
required to give a blood/urine/breath sample at the police station?
Well, you can demand a lawyer, but you may not get one. Some states do
not allow you to request a lawyer at the time of your breath test, but
that may be changing. In 2014, the New York Court of Appeals ruled in
*People v. Gursey* that the refusal to allow access to a lawyer during
the breath test was a violation of the defendant's access to counsel.
The phone call to a lawyer could have taken place in minutes, and
shouldn't have been a tremendous burden on the state. People abuse that
privilege by asking for an attorney so that they have more time to
"sober up" before the breath test. In states that allow it, you are
generally allowed a phone consult with an attorney; you are not allowed
to wait for an attorney to arrive. Will it be used against you? Probably
not; you will either be allowed or not allowed to request to speak to an
attorney before your breath test, and if you are allowed, it will be a
quick phone consult. In most states, you may not have an attorney
present for the breath test.
