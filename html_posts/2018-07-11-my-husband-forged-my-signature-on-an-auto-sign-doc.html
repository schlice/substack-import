**My husband forged my signature on an auto sign document. Is it
legal?**

I'm going to assume that in your answer "auto sign" means some document
you needed to sign for your "auto" or your car. You probably meant to
say an "auto loan" document.

[[Definition of forgery from
FindLaw.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=de2e90&url=http://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-charges/forgery.html){.external_link

Notice the essential element of forgery as a crime (emphasis mine):

> In most jurisdictions, the crime of forgery is not charged unless the
> forgery is done **with intent to deceive or the attempt to commit
> fraud or larceny**. For instance, works of arts can be copied or

Therefore, legally speaking, ***if he actually had your permission, and
you consented to the signature***, the signature is legal.

But the legality turns on *intent*, which is very difficult to prove. So
if I was your husband, I'd have taken a picture of the document and sent
it to you and you would have replied saying "go ahead and sign for me"
so that I had a paper trail that I could prove that you consented to me
signing your name.

Now, you didn't say whether or not you consented to your signature being
used. ***If you did not consent to your signature being used***, it is
by definition a forgery, and the signature is void, and your husband
could be facing fraud charges. If it's a loan, he could be facing bank
fraud charges, and that's a Federal crime.
