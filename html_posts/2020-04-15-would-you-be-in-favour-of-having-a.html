**Would you be in favour of having a \"reluctant\" option on voting
ballots so that the stats show how many people reluctantly voted for a
candidate (such as Joe Biden, someone who is not popular but many would
reluctantly vote for him to get Trump out)?**

To what end? Does your vote count differently if you voted for someone
but your reasoning was different?

Are we going to decide that someone was unpopular and then go decide
whether or not we're going to count the votes of "reluctant" voters?

No. The answer is no. We have a hard enough time getting registered
voters to go vote. Adding more options is probably not adviseable.
