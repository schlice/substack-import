I disagree with the sentiment that "men should not hit women." This
sentiment implies that simply because women are the "fairer sex,"
meaning they are, on average, physically weaker than men, that men
should never hit women.

This is not a valid reason to not hit a woman.

I would modify the topic and make two separate topics:

- Why a man does not need to resort to violence to solve problems
- Chivalry is not dead; what does chivalry mean

You should note that none of this discussion has anything to do with
defending yourself. If someone is attacking you, defend yourself.
Doesn't matter if it's a man, a woman, or a mountain lion, if you're
being attacked, you defend yourself, period. No one of any sex has the
right to physically assault you, and you always have the right to defend
yourself against any attack.

That said, and outside of those circumstances, a true, strong man (in
both physique and character) should not need to use violence to solve
any problem. You should know and practice **de-escalation techniques**
to make a violent confrontation, less so. Learning how to listen is a
lifelong skill that will serve you well in both conflict resolution and
interpersonal communications.

I took a course in school called *Aikido and the Art of Conflict
Resolution*. It talked about the similarities between the martial art of
Aikido and the techniques used in conflict resolution. Aikido has at its
core the ability to "embrace" your attacker's energy, and instead of
using that energy *against* the attacker, you *redirect* your attacker's
energy away harmlessly. In conflict resolution, we do the same thing: we
"embrace" the issues of our opponent by active listening and
understanding their position, and then we "redirect" their energy into
something positive to help them with their issues. The class was very
enlightening, and I'm happy to report that some things you learn in
school actually do stick with you.

You should also teach your boys what it means to be chivalrous, and how
a man should treat a woman. You should teach your boys why we respect
women, and show them through practice what that means. It's never enough
to tell them how to do it. It's far more valuable to model that behavior
in your own life. In fact, you could get away with never telling them
how to do it or what it means, if you actually model it for them in your
own interactions with women, you will teach them far more than your
words will ever accomplish.

I raised three boys, and they are all young adults now. I can't say I
was perfect, but this was the template I used when teaching them how to
interact with the world, and with women.
