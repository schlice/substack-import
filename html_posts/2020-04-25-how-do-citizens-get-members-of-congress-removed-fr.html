**How do citizens get members of Congress removed from office?**

The ballot box.

Either every two (for the House) or every six (for the Senate) years,
your members of Congress are up for election. Vote them out. Replace
them with someone who actually represents your interests.

The Constitution does not allow for citizen removal of any person
elected to federal public office. It was considered in 1787 for
inclusion into the Constitution, but it did not appear in the final
document. Some states have stated their right to recall a member from
Congress, but it has never been tested by the Supreme Court, so its
constitutionality still stands in question.

Therefore, if you think this was an oversight, the way to fix it is a
Constitutional amendment. Good luck getting a supermajority of Congress
to Constitutionally authorize more oversight into their job performance.
