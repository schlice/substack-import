Expulsion decisions are never automatic. A school and its associated
school district will always review each and every case individually
before coming to a determination.

But if I venture a guess, I'd say that in more cases than not, a young
adult being adjudicated as a sex offender before graduating high school
might pose some safety issues for the other students. Of course, the
specific act which caused the student to be labeled as a sex offender
will have to be considered (i.e. some cities consider public urination
as a sex crime, especially if seen by another person under 18).

While not every situation would automatically result in expulsion, the
school would be *forced* to review and make a determination in order to
continue to provide a safe environment for students to learn.
