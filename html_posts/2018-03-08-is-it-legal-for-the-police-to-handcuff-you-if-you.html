**Is it legal for the police to handcuff you if you are not yet placed
under arrest or if there is no evidence to justify an arrest?**

Absolutely. There is a difference between being "detained" and being
"under arrest."

They will usually also say something along the lines of, "You are not
under arrest, I am merely **detaining** you for your safety and for mine
while I \<*go do x y and z over there and can't watch you\>*. Now sit
right here and don't move."

Handcuffs do not imply "arrest." They do imply "detention." Those two
words mean different things.

For example, while you're handcuffed and you can't leave, can the
officer ask you questions without Mirandizing you? The answer is **no**,
because it would be considered "custodial interrogation," and you would
need to be informed of your Miranda rights before being questioned.

So while you may be "detained," which simply means you are not free to
leave, you are not "under arrest," which means the officer has
reasonable suspicion to believe that you committed a crime, and you are
being detained for that crime.

**TL;DR: Courts have ruled that it is legal to handcuff you while you
are detained, even if you are not under arrest.**
