Depends on where this happened.

In Colorado, parole is an *additional* punishment, which is attached at
the end of a prison sentence. In addition, parole can also be early
release from prison, in which case [[Tim

answer is correct.

Colorado parole officers have the option of violating a person back to
prison in most cases, and in recent years, the rules about when parolees
must be violated back to prison have been loosened even further. But
this policy [[has led to greater
recidivism](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1df7b7&url=http://www.denverpost.com/parole/ci_24168872/colorado-parolees-some-fear-new-policies-put-public){.external_link

increased risk to public safety.
