**Will U.S. House ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal be
successful with plans to subpoena President Donald Trump\'s tax
returns?**

We don't know, because it's never been really tested.

There is a law ([[26 U.S. Code ยง
6103](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=36f48b&url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6103){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="cornell.edu"}]{.qlink_container}) which allows the Chairman
of the Ways and Means Committee to request tax returns from the
Secretary of the Treasury.

In the past, secretaries have complied with these requests. The
possibility exists, especially with Trump's general refusal to release
his tax returns, that Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin may refuse the
request.

If he does, Congress can hold him in contempt. They could then subpoena
the returns, and the whole case would end up in court.

If such a court case were to actually appear, whether or not the court
would enforce the subpoena would turn largely on whether or not the
request is for a legitimate purpose, or if it is just being used to
embarrass or harass the president. There is precedent for Congress to be
able to exercise its oversight authority with respect to the IRS, and
that alone is justification to request those returns. Additional
justification for release would be in relation to Special Counsel Robert
Mueller's investigation into Trump-Russia collusion. If his report
includes anything which would be found in a tax return, then the
legitimacy of the request would be nearly self-evident. Therefore, it's
likely that a court would uphold the subpoena, and the requested returns
would be released.

In any case, the request would have to be limited to any filings made
while Trump was in office (to gauge whether or not Trump's interaction
with the IRS was legal while he had authority as president).
