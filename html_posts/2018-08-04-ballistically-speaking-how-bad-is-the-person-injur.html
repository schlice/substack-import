**Ballistically speaking, how bad is the person injured when shot in the
center mass from an elephant rifle when compared to .308 caliber or
similar cartridges?**

The "elephant gun" shoots a .600 Nitro Express round specifically
designed for it.

This monster is a **900 grain** behemoth which, in its largest
configuration, a 120 grain loading of powder, produces a muzzle velocity
of 2,050 fps and an impact force of **8,400 ft-lb.**

The .308 Winchester also has multiple configurations, the largest of
which is the Lapua. The round is **185** **grain**, travels at a
slightly faster 2,510 fps, and has an impact force of a measly **2,588
ft-lb.**

When you impart over three times the force of a .308, you can imagine
the size of the wound cavity you would be creating. Yep, you guessed it,
it's more than three times as large.
