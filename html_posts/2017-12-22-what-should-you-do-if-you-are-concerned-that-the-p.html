If you are being stopped by a **marked** car, you should have much less
cause for concern than if you are being stopped by an **unmarked** car.

Marked cars display the name of the agency and usually have light bars
on the top of the car.

Unmarked cars are much more easily created by someone attempting to
impersonate a police officer. They are sometimes, but not always, simply
unpainted police vehicles, with lights mounted inside windows and under
grills:

In either case, you should call 911 if you don't recognize the vehicle
attempting to stop you. If you are being stopped by a marked vehicle,
call 911 while you stop. If you are being stopped by an unmarked
vehicle, while you are calling 911, drive slowly along the side of the
road with your flashers on.

Note that in most jurisdictions, there is no lawful reason for you to
avoid stopping when an officer attempts to stop you, so if you failed to
stop for a real officer, you could potentially face consequences for
that failure, but the idea is that you feel unsafe, and so you simply
throw yourself at the mercy of the officer, and ultimately, the courts
if you do get a ticket for failing to stop. Any time you fail to stop,
for whatever reason, you must bear this in mind.
