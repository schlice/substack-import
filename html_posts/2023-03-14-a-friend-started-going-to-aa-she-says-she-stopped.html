I am not an atheist, but have spent many years in the rooms of Nar Anon,
so I have personal experience. I have also attended NA, AA and Al Anon
meetings, so I have a good foundation of that which I speak.

I'll give you the TL;DR up front: **There should never be "god talk" at
an AA meeting. There should be "higher power" talk.**

Believing in a higher power is important in addiction treatment. In
fact, in most 12-step programs, it is Step 2: "Came to believe that a
power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity." But what,
exactly, is a power *greater than ourselves,* or a "higher power?"

A lot of people think that a "higher power" means God. And for many
people, it does. *But it doesn't have to be.* **At its heart, a higher
power is some power greater than yourself which controls the universe**.
It could be God. It could be Nature. It could be the universe itself. Or
it could be the "collective consciousness" of all the people in the
room. But whatever you choose should be personal and mean something
special to you. Following your higher power, whatever it is, can help
you stay sober.

How? When you believe in something greater than yourself, you can more
easily forgive yourself and start to change. Belief in a higher power
helps you to let go of all of the guilt and pain associated with your
addiction. Recovery might occasionally seem daunting to those who are
fighting their addictions. It can be scary to confront on your own. But
discovering a higher power might give you the courage necessary to move
forward. You\'re never alone if you have your higher power. Finally,
finding a higher power reduces your chance of relapse. When someone
quits using drugs or alcohol, they frequently require a new, positive
focus to take its place. That goal could be to commune with a higher
power to forge a new spiritual path.

**12-step programs are not religious, but they are spiritual.** Belief
in a higher power (whatever higher power you choose) is something that
addicts find critical in their pursuit of continuing sobriety.

Decry higher powers all you want; millions of addicts have found
serenity and continued sobriety by putting their trust in a higher
power.

(EDIT) An atheist in my comments pointed out that some won't even engage
in *spiritual* programs.

Interesting.

Okay, if as an atheist you even denounce the *spiritual* instead of just
the *religious*, the answer is that there are other **specifically
non-spiritual** recovery programs which were intentionally created for
people just like you:

- **SMART Recovery** - SMART (Self-Management And Recovery Training)
  Recovery uses cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and other
  evidence-based approaches to behavior change.
- **Secular Organizations for Sobriety (SOS)** - SOS believes people can
  stay sober based on personal integrity, values, and beliefs. The SOS
  sobriety approach is "sobriety priority." This means that anyone can
  stay sober if they make sobriety their number one life priority.
- **LifeRing Secular Recovery -** LifeRing supports participants in
  being the leader of their recovery, knowing their triggers and knowing
  what they need to overcome them. It focuses on strengthening the
  "sober self" and weakening the "addicted self."

\

Ultimately, only you can decide if you want to get sober. No one can do
it for you. There are spiritual and non-spiritual options to aid you in
your journey to recovery.

But no one can do it for you. Only you can find peace and sobriety. You
have to decide that you want to be sober. That's when the healing can
begin --- regardless of what path you take to that healing.
