As with almost every legal question on Quora, the answer is "it
depends." States all treat funeral processions differently. There is no
one standard across the country.

Twenty years ago, funeral processions would simply drive with their
headlights on. This was before DRLs (Daytime Running Lamps) became
standard, so it was easy to tell the entirety of the procession: they
were the only ones with headlights on during the day. Construction
workers on the roads would stop their work and doff their hard hats
while the procession passed; you rarely see that these days either, but
I digress...

These days, states vary in their requirements for funeral processions.
Some states have no provisions whatsoever for funeral processions, and
some state that funeral processions have no additional traffic rights
over any other vehicle. Some states may require the entire procession to
have flags mounted on their cars, or hang tags on their rear-view
mirrors, or drive with their hazard flashers running. Some states
prevent other vehicles from driving in to a funeral procession if it is
apparent that one is in progress. Some states require an "escort
vehicle" to accompany the procession. Arizona even allows the escort
vehicle to sport red and blue flashing lights and exceed the speed limit
by up to 15 miles per hour to catch back up to the front of the
procession to guide it through the next intersection. Literally, state
laws are all over the map on this, and each state regards funeral
processions differently.

Your funeral home will advise you of the rules for the procession. If
you're part of a procession, try to drive as close to the car in front
of you as is safe to do, and follow all of the state laws regarding
processions.

It kinda feels like I didn't answer the question. **Why** is this
allowed? Because the individual state has determined how they want to
treat a funeral procession. As you can see from the rest of my answer,
not all states agree on how to do that.
