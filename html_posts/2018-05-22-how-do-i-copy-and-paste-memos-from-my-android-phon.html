[[Furkan

spot on, Pushbullet is the easiest way to copy and paste between your
laptop and your phone. I love Pushbullet; its automation features are
awesome, and I can integrate it with IFTTT for even more automation.

You can also use other sync programs such as the ones you probably are
already using in Android, such as Google Drive. Save your memo to your
Google Drive and open it on your laptop. You probably don't even need to
install anything else.
