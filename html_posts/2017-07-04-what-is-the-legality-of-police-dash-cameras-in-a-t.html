First, most laws regarding two-party authorization are related to
*audio* recordings, not video-only recordings. These laws stem from the
old wiretapping laws from landline phone calls. Most civilian dash cams
will generally only record video, so this usually isn't an issue.

But even if it does record audio, in almost all jurisdictions I know of,
and in most cases (even though there are lots of exceptions), if you can
see it, you can record it. There is no expectation of privacy in public
places, so if you can see it out of your windscreen, you can record it
legally. Lots of exceptions here, like recording on private property,
recording places where reasonable expectations of privacy exist, etc.

Finally, being a driver means consenting to law enforcement activity,
which includes having your entire encounter recorded. You consented to
this when you signed your driver's license. In fact, dashcam recordings
(law enforcement and civilian) are almost universally admissible in
court, despite the wiretap laws. So thinking that you can get a dashcam
video thrown out because you were never informed that you were being
recorded and you never consented to it is not going to work.
