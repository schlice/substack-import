**Trump seems to want to use money ear marked for an emergency to build
the wall. Can this be voted down by the Senate?**

There is no money "earmarked for an emergency." If there were, it would
actually be easier for him to use that money. He declares a national
emergency (which he is well within his authority as President to do),
and the money becomes available.

The way this works is that in many of our Federal laws are these little
inbuilt "short-circuits" that allow the president to do certain things
that would normally have to go through Congressional approval during a
time of declared war or declared national emergency. Clearly, declared
war is out, as declarations of war can only be made by Congress. But the
president can declare a national emergency, and it's solely his job to
do so. [[It's been done many
times](https://www.quora.com/How-can-a-U-S-president-simply-declare-there-will-be-an-emergency-some-number-of-days-in-the-future-specifically-pending-the-outcome-of-a-funding-measure/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container},
probably more often than you know. It's governed by the National
Emergencies Act. The law outlines what the president needs to do in
order to declare a national emergency.

Once the national emergency is declared, all of these Federal laws with
their little inbuilt short-circuits become available. For instance, 10
USC § 2808 has the following in it (*emphasis* added):

> \[I\]n the event of a declaration of war *or the declaration by the
> President of a national emergency* in accordance with the National
> Emergencies Act (50 USC § 1601 et seq.) *that requires use of the
> armed forces*, the Secretary of Defense, without regard to any other
> provision of law, may undertake military construction projects, and
> may authorize the Secretaries of the military departments to undertake
> military construction projects, not otherwise authorized by law *that
> are necessary to support such use of the armed forces.* Such projects
> may be undertaken *only within the total amount of funds that have
> been appropriated for military construction*, including funds
> appropriated for family housing, that have not been obligated.

Now, if you read this carefully, you'll see that this applies when the
president declares a national emergency, and that emergency involves the
use of the military. The construction projects must support the mission
that the military is undertaking.

To that end, we have military stationed at the border, and we are
sending more. DHS has been requesting additional troops since January.
DHS needs the help doing things like installing more concertina wire.

Therefore, the military deployment, and their mission, could be laying
the groundwork for a legal basis to invoke 10 USC § 2808(a) to release
funds to construct a more permanent barrier like the one they're already
constructing.

To your question, this is outside of Congress' hands. Why? **Congress
already gave the President the authority to do this when they wrote the
law with a provision for national emergency**. Legally, if the President
meets the burden of evidence required by the law, he is well within his
right to declare a national emergency and then use DoD funds to secure
the border.

There are several reasons he can cite to declare a national emergency.
It's hard to make the case that illegal immigration constitutes a
national emergency, but that's not the only crisis which could easily
constitute a national emergency at the southern border. The most obvious
other crisis is the counterdrug effort.

[[10 U.S.C. §
284](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1dce3e&url=http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req%3D(title:10%2520section:284%2520edition:prelim)%2520OR%2520(granuleid:USC-prelim-title10-section284)%26f%3Dtreesort%26edition%3Dprelim%26num%3D0%26jumpTo%3Dtrue){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="house.gov"}]{.qlink_container} authorizes the Secretary of
Defense to "provide support for the counterdrug activities or activities
to counter transnational organized crime of any other department or
agency of the Federal Government or of any State, local, tribal, or
foreign law enforcement agency" for the purposes set forth in the
section if requested by another Federal agency or State, local, or
tribal governments in support of law enforcement efforts. We in NORAD
have been using this provision to assist the counterdrug mission for
decades. We have been using our southern resources (downward-looking
RADAR, incerceptor aircraft, etc) to assist the DEA in their drug
interdiction role.

The things the military is authorized to do under 10 USC § 284 include,
among other things, "\[c\]onstruction of roads and *fences* and
installation of lighting to block drug smuggling corridors across
international boundaries of the United States," as well as the "\[t\]he
establishment (including an unspecified minor military construction
project) and operation of bases of operations or training facilities for
the purpose of facilitating counterdrug activities or activities to
counter transnational organized crime of the Department of Defense or
any Federal, State, local, or tribal law enforcement agency within or
outside the United States" (emphasis added).

You will note that the President has been backing off of using the word
"wall" and has instead started (seemingly begrudgingly) calling it a
"border barrier" or a "fence" or "whatever you'd like to call it" (his
words, not mine). But again, is he being obsequious, or is he actually
laying the groundwork of being able to call this wall a "border fence"
and thus be able to fund it under the counterdrug mission included in 10
USC § 284?

We shall soon see.
