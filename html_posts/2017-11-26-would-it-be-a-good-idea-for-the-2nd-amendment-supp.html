**Would it be a good idea for the 2nd Amendment supporters to pass a law
shielding manufacturers of ALL products from liability for misuse of
products?**

First of all, I should probably point out the logical flaws here.

- 2nd Amendment supporters (which should be everyone in America because
  if you're American, you should support the Constitution) don't have
  any special relationship with the law beyond what any other American
  has.
- 2nd Amendment supporters don't pass laws. Congress does.

That said, if there was a rash of lawsuits that was designed to drive
companies out of business simply by suing them, when their products
actually functioned as designed, then yes, we should push for a national
law that defines product liability lawsuit statutes more strictly. In
other words, the product actually must malfunction, or be used contrary
to its design, in order to bring a product liability lawsuit.

But that's not the case.

It's only in the firearms industry that product liability lawsuits are
brought when the product functions normally. The entire point of these
lawsuits is not to address a faulty product, but a faulty use of the
product, which is not the purpose of a product liability lawsuit. The
entire point is to drive these companies out of business by constantly
having to defend against product liability lawsuits. When the goal of a
lawsuit is to destroy a company, You're Doing It Wrongâ„¢. You don't sue a
company so you can destroy it. You don't file a product liability
lawsuit when the product performs exactly as designed.

This is why the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act was passed in
the first place. Guns are indeed designed to kill, and they do so
effectively. Therefore, suing the gun manufacturer when the gun
functions exactly as it was designed, is an incorrect application of a
product liability lawsuit.
