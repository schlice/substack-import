**Content:** [If both Initiative 591 and 594 pass, the process put in
place by Initiative 594 would be illegal under Initiative 591.\
\
There would probably be a runoff election with a single ballot question
asking if the process in Initiative 594 should be legal, or if the
process in Initiative 591 should be legal. If 594 is found to be legal,
then Initiative 591 would be striken from the law and Initiative 594
would remain.]{.rendered_qtext}
