Let's start with morality and then move to justice.

You can answer the morality question all on your own, and you can do it
by answering just one question: **from where do we get our morality?**

For example, everyone just naturally knows that it's wrong to kill an
innocent person. We didn't have to be taught this, we just know it.
University of Texas at Austin professor J. Budziszewski writes,
"Everyone knows certain principles. There is no land where murder is
virtue and gratitude vice." C. S. Lewis, who has written profoundly on
this topic in his classic work *Mere Christianity* put it this way:
"Think of a country where people were admired for running away in
battle, or where a man felt proud of double-crossing all the people who
had been kindest to him. You might just as well try to imagine a country
where two and two made five."

In other words, a "shared morality" exists between people. So I ask
again: **from where do we get this shared morality?**

If you think we just naturally evolved, then this shared morality must
have come from evolution, the universe. But I fail to see how a
meaningless, purposeless, amoral universe could produce creatures (us)
who are full of shared morality and who strive for meaning and purpose
in their lives. That is a principle which makes no sense, and it
violates the Law of Causality, which says (among other things) that an
effect must resemble its cause.

If the universe (clearly) did not provide us with this shared morality,
the only other option is that we were created by Something other than
the universe, and that Something imbued us with a shared morality.

There are moral absolutes. And if you don't believe me, maybe we can
start treating *you* unfairly and we'll see how you like it. Your
reaction will reveal the Moral Law written on your heart.

\

Once you come to realize that a Moral Law exists, you understand that
the Moral Law is the unchanging basis for justice. Let me go back to C.
S. Lewis, who writes: "\[As an atheist\] my argument against God was
that the universe seemed so cruel and unjust. But how had I got this
idea of just and unjust? A man does not call a line crooked unless he
has some idea of a straight line. What was I comparing this universe
with when I called it unjust?"

In other words, we can only detect *injustice* because we have an
unwavering, unchanging understanding of what *justice* is. You can't
know what is evil unless you know what is good. And you can't know what
is good unless there is an unchanging standard of goodness which exists
outside of yourself. Without that objective standard, any objection to
evil is nothing more than your personal opinion.

\

Therefore, morality and justice are neither natural phenomenon, nor are
they human creations. They are gifts from our Creator who is the one
unchanging standard of both morality and justice. He is the standard we
emulate, even if we don't recognize that the standard even exists.
