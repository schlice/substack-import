**Content:** [Besides the difficulty noted by my other esteemed
colleagues on this answer, you have to remember we don\'t shoot to
\"contain the situation.\" **We shoot to stop the act**. We don\'t
\"shoot to kill\" although as was pointed out already, almost any shot
of any consequence can cause death, and often does. Understanding this,
when you shoot to stop the act, and that is your goal, what is the most
effective method by which you can do this? If you are responding to a DV
and facing a knife-wielding suspect who is high on heroin and crack and
is charging at you (and let\'s assume he is 285 lbs and has 3% body fat,
and let\'s assume that another police officer struck him across the nose
with his 4 D-Cell Mag-Light \"swinging for the fences\" and he didn\'t
even break his stride, but that\'s a story for another time)? Shooting
him in the arm or leg is just going to piss him off, and that\'s the
truth. He may eventually bleed out, but you won\'t stop him. **The most
effective way to shoot someone to achieve your goal of stopping the act
is in the center of mass.**\
\
You think it\'s okay to artificially attempt to weaken your own force
when you know that it\'s very likely going to result in the subject\'s
death anyway and you have less of a chance of doing what it is that you
are setting out to do (stop the act)? It\'s like getting behind the
wheel and saying you want to run someone over \"just a little bit.\"
There are other non-lethal force options available to officers these
days (hand-to-hand, baton, TASER, pepper spray, etc) which comprise a
\"continuum of force\" which ***ends*** with the firearm. If the officer
feels he can safely stop the act and control the situation with a lower
level of force, he will use it.\
\
TL;DR: Remember the key points:\

- Guns are designed to kill, and they do so very effectively and
  efficiently. Modern day ammunition is not designed to maim or cause
  additional trauma; it is designed to kill, efficiently.

<!-- -->

- When an officer shoots, it is to stop the act. They don\'t \"shoot to
  kill\" or even \"shoot not to kill.\" Guns are designed to kill, so if
  you\'re shooting, someone is likely going to die. Remember that.\
- There is a \"continuum of force\" which ***ends*** with the firearm.
  Officers will use the lowest level of force they can safely employ
  which will stop the act. The firearm, while at the end of the force
  continuum, is still on that continuum, and if none of the other force
  methods can be used safely and without increased danger to the officer
  or the public, the firearm will be used.
