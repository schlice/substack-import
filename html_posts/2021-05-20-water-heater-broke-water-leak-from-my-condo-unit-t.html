Get a lawyer. You're going to need one when the condo association sues
you.

If your local laws and your condo association's CC&R say that you are
not liable for the damage, you and your lawyer will have to use that as
your defense when the condo association sues you for the repair costs.

Your only other option is to pay for the repair out of pocket. So pay
for the lawyer, or pay for the repair, you choose.
