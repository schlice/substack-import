While it can be argued that they are not \"telecommunications
companies,\" but they are \"customer connection enablement company\"
which gives them wider latitude to connect customers in greater ways,
they are definitely not in the business of owning sports teams.

\"Advertising\" in sports and investing in stadium naming rights (which
is just another form of advertising) is just smart business sense.
Getting into the business of actually owning a team is a little too far
outside their business to be practicable.
