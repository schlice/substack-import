When studying the Bible, it is important to determine whether the verse
or passage at hand is descriptive or prescriptive. The difference is
this: a passage is *descriptive* if it is simply describing something
that happened, while a passage is *prescriptive* if it is specifically
teaching that something should happen. Simply put, is it a description
or a command? Is the passage *describing* something (it happened) or is
it *prescribing* something (it should happen)? The difference is
important. When a biblical passage is only describing something but is
interpreted as prescribing something, it can lead to errant thinking and
behavior.

And if we have difficulty determining whether a particular passage is
prescriptive or descriptive, it often helps us to look at the larger
context.

So let's zoom out to 2 Corinthians 11:**16--33**. In this section of the
chapter, Paul details the physical hardships he endured while serving
Christ. He describes sleepless nights, hunger, thirst, cold, and
exposure (nakedness), all of which were a direct result of his ministry.
Some of these struggles came from lack of resources, while others were
due to imprisonment or difficult travels. His suffering, though seen as
failure by some, was actually a testament to his dedication and service.
Paul\'s discussion of his weakness in this chapter will lead to his
conclusion in the next chapter that Christ is strongest in him when he
is weak.

> *So to keep me from becoming conceited because of the surpassing
> greatness of the revelations, a thorn was given me in the flesh, a
> messenger of Satan to harass me, to keep me from becoming conceited.
> Three times I pleaded with the Lord about this, that it should leave
> me. But he said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power
> is made perfect in weakness." Therefore I will boast all the more
> gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me.
> For the sake of Christ, then, I am content with weaknesses, insults,
> hardships, persecutions, and calamities. For when I am weak, then I am
> strong. \-- 2 Cor 12:7--10 ESV*

In other words, just because Paul describe it happening to him doesn't
make it *prescriptive* on us. That said, we can still learn from the
larger context of Paul's experience. We can learn that Christ is
strongest when we are weak.
