**What would it take to shut down the Fraternal Order of Police?**

While I have no idea why you'd want to do such a thing, the answer is
the same for any club or organization, not just the FOP.

*You need to have a majority of the Board of Directors and a majority of
the stakeholders agree that the organization is no longer meeting its
goals and objectives, and agreeing that the best course of action is to
disband the organization.*

There is no outside influence you can exert that will shut down an
organization as old and as large as the FOP. None. They will only shut
down when they choose to shut down.
