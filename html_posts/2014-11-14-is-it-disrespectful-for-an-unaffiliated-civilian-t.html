it\'s just as likely that the person displaying the \"thin blue line\"
decal is a cop as he is someone who simply supports the police, but in
almost any case, is just trying to get out of a speeding ticket.\
\
I see many cops today do this not on their own vehicles, but on the
vehicles of their spouses or family. They\'re not so much worried about
getting jammed up themselves, but would very much like other cops to
know that the person they are pulling over is the spouse of a cop.\
\
When I was growing up on Long Island, the state allowed the Nassau
County Police Department (for whom my father worked as a PO and later as
a Detective) to get plates where the three letters on the plate were
\"NCP\". My dad\'s plate was \"93-NCP\" and that plate was only
available to police officers. I can only assume (although I can\'t
remember) that the state allowed Suffolk County Police Department
officers to get \"SCP\" plates, NYPD officers to get \"NYP\" plates,
etc.\
\
In my experience, the plates never stopped him from being pulled over
for what he did while he was driving with me. So I don\'t really
understand the appeal. The fact that he likely knew the person pulling
him over, or worked with that person, probably was what got him out of
tickets.\
\
A more common practice for family members was for the officer to give
family members a photocopy of his ID card. My dad also gave me a
\"family badge,\" which was a miniature version of his full-size shield,
which was also supposed to help family members in the \"professional
courtesy\" department. Anyway, the photocopy actually did get me out of
a ticket once, when I was still partially living at home. I was
attending school at the Air Force Academy, but was home on leave,
visiting my girlfriend. I was headed home, and it was late (or early AM,
to be precise), and it was raining. I had borrowed my brother\'s car to
go see her, since I no longer had a car at home. I wasn\'t used to it,
and I was driving too fast for conditions when the light in front of me
changed. I slammed on the brakes (no ABS at this time), and slid into
the intersection. Fortunately, there was no one there, so I simply
turned right and continued on. Alas, this was a \"No Turn On Red\"
intersection, and I was immediately lit up from behind. I pulled over
and explained to the cop what had happened. I gave her my driver\'s
license, my military ID, and that copy of my dad\'s ID card. She glanced
through the documents while I was talking until she got to the ID card
copy, when she interrupted me:\
\
\"This your dad?\"\
\"Yep.\"\
\"Where does he work?\"\
\"First squad.\"\
\"Be careful on your way home.\"\
\
Today, I interpret this for what it is: the officer was exercising that
same professional courtesy to a family member especially when the charge
was not terribly egregious.]{.rendered_qtext}
