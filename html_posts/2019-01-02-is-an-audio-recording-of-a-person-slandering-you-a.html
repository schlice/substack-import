**Is an audio recording of a person slandering you admissible in a court
of law if you decide to sue them?**

The answer is "it depends."

It depends on how you got the recording, and in which state the
recording was made. In all states, at least one party to the
conversation needs to have known that the conversation was being
recorded. In some states, both parties to the conversation need to have
known that the conversation was being recorded (these are called
"two-party consent states"). So depending on how the recording was made
and whether or not your state is a two party consent state will
determine whether or not the recording can be introduced as evidence in
a civil proceeding.
