**Content:** [DISCLAIMER: SMOKING ANYTHING IS UNSAFE.\
DISCLAIMER: DON\'T DO DRUGS\
\
Now that we\'ve gotten the legalese out of the way, it\'s hard to say
specifically because statistics haven\'t been taken specifically about
smoking marijuana, and many drug users who smoke marijuana also smoke
cigarettes.\
\
Ultimately, you\'re never going to get anyone to say that smoking
marijuana is safer than smoking cigarettes. What studies have been done
to show the safety of marijuana smoke? Once the collective decision was
made to destroy the cigarette industry, it was easy to find studies to
vilify the cigarette. Now that marijuana has been legalized by certain
states, more studies are being done now. What we are finding is that the
effect on the developing brain (people younger than 25) is MUCH greater
than we originally thought. Marijuana essentially ARRESTS development of
the brain, and the longer the drug is used, the slower the brain
develops. The brain does return to normal development once the drug is
stopped, but this delay throws off the developmental cycle of the brain.
Forgive me but I don\'t have the citations for those studies as they are
very new and probably not fully peer-reviewed yet either.\
\
So you may not have the same lung issues, but the issues in the brain
are just as bad, if not worse.\
\
Not to mention the issues that the drug itself causes, which is an issue
for another answer.\
\
So you\'re basically trading a headache for a
toothache.]{.rendered_qtext}
