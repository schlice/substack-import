<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [DISCLAIMER: SMOKING ANYTHING IS UNSAFE.\<br>DISCLAIMER: DON\'T DO DRUGS\<br>\<br>Now that we\'ve gotten the legalese out of the way, it\'s hard to say<br>specifically because statistics haven\'t been taken specifically about<br>smoking marijuana, and many drug users who smoke marijuana also smoke<br>cigarettes.\<br>\<br>Ultimately, you\'re never going to get anyone to say that smoking<br>marijuana is safer than smoking cigarettes. What studies have been done<br>to show the safety of marijuana smoke? Once the collective decision was<br>made to destroy the cigarette industry, it was easy to find studies to<br>vilify the cigarette. Now that marijuana has been legalized by certain<br>states, more studies are being done now. What we are finding is that the<br>effect on the developing brain (people younger than 25) is MUCH greater<br>than we originally thought. Marijuana essentially ARRESTS development of<br>the brain, and the longer the drug is used, the slower the brain<br>develops. The brain does return to normal development once the drug is<br>stopped, but this delay throws off the developmental cycle of the brain.<br>Forgive me but I don\'t have the citations for those studies as they are<br>very new and probably not fully peer-reviewed yet either.\<br>\<br>So you may not have the same lung issues, but the issues in the brain<br>are just as bad, if not worse.\<br>\<br>Not to mention the issues that the drug itself causes, which is an issue<br>for another answer.\<br>\<br>So you\'re basically trading a headache for a<br>toothache.]<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
