You would definitely be asked to come back and talk to the detectives
regarding the recent robberies.

You would be asked about the details of those robberies.

The detectives would be looking for specific details that were not
revealed to the press, things that would only be known to the police and
the perpetrator.

They would also want to know why you are turning yourself in. Most
criminals try to **not** get caught, and statistically, most do not. So
you stand a better chance of never going to jail if you don't confess to
your involvement. So they would want to know your motivations.

The police are, understandably, cautious. There are "attention-seekers"
who are like children who do "naughty" things just to get attention from
their parents. For them, any attention is good. Even negative attention.
Also, you could be attempting to take the blame for someone else
(perhaps your child actually committed the robbery and you want to take
the fall for him so he doesn't have to go to jail). So you can
understand that the police would be skeptical of someone turning
themselves in unprovoked.

If, however, your story truly checks out, and the police are thoroughly
convinced that you are the perpetrator, they will eventually arrest you.
