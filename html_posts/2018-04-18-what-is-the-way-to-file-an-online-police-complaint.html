**What is the way to file an online police complaint on a man who cheats
a girl by engaging & leaves her before marriage?**

First of all, in the United States, breaking off an engagement is not a
crime. You don't need the police involved; they won't get involved
because, as I mentioned, it is not illegal to break off an engagement.

You can only file online complaints for routine items if your local
police department supports online reporting. For example, at my local
police department, I can report the following online:

**Theft Of:**

- Personal Belongings (*Where you or another person allowed the suspect
  to enter your property/residence.)*
- Car Parts
- License Plates
- Trailers with a VIN or license plate

**Other Crimes:**

- Damage to Your Property
- Vandalism to Your Property
- Property You Have Lost

**Businesses Only:**

- Gas Skips (No suspect information or license plate information)

Visit your local police department's website to see if they support
online reporting.

As for the breaking of the engagement, you might be able to file a
lawsuit and allege pain and suffering from the act, but I doubt you will
be successful. Marriage is a mutual agreement; just be glad that you
didn't actually marry the wrong person.
