Can they be sued? Sure. Anyone can be sued for anything. The question is
how likely is it that the aggrieved party will prevail.

Whether or not they prevail is dependent on many things. One of those
things is whether or not the trespassed party was responsible for
addressing any known hazards in the pool area. If there was a known
hazard that the trespassed party was responsible for addressing, that
person did not address that hazard, that person was then trespassed but
the hazard remained, and someone else was injured because of the known
hazard, the person responsible for the hazard can still be sued. They
don't need to be present at the time of the injury in order for their
negligence to be responsible for the conditions which resulted in it.

Of course, the trespassed party would claim, in that instance, that they
would have addressed the hazard had they not been trespassed. So they
will claim that it was the trespass that resulted in the hazard
remaining in place, not their negligence.

In such a case, the liability incurred by the trespassed person will be
reduced because of the fact that they were trespassed. It may not be
eliminated completely, but it will most definitely be reduced.

So can they be sued? Sure they can. Anyone can be sued for anything.
Whether or not the aggrieved party will prevail will depend greatly upon
the facts of the particular case. But you gotta admit, it's hard to
address a known hazard when you've been trespassed from a facility.
