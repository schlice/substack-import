**Content:** [Men are primarily visual creatures. Attraction, then,
starts with the eyes. Men look for what they perceive as beauty. Much of
what men perceive as beauty is based on societal norms, but part of that
perception is self-derived, and is based on many factors (the
environment in which they were raised, their ability to overcome
societal prejudices, etc). It is different for each man, which is the
source of the expression \"beauty is in the eye of the beholder.\"\
\
Once they have selected using the visual criteria, they move on to the
intellectual/emotional criteria (does she have similar interests to me,
does she pique my curiosity, do I want to get to know her better, is she
exciting, does she seem interested in me, etc).\
\
The more of these criteria that match what a man is looking for, the
quicker the man starts to fall in love.]{.rendered_qtext}
