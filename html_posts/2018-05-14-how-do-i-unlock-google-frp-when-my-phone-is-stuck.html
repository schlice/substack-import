**How do I unlock Google FRP when my phone is stuck with a Samsung
keypad and not a Gboard?**

Google's Factory Reset Protection does not require **Gboard** (the
Google keyboard) in order to unlock it. It requires the last owner of
the device to log in to their Google account in order to complete the
factory reset.

Additionally, the previous owner can go into their own Google profile on
the web and delete the device from their recently used devices. This
will also clear out the FRP if you are having difficulty doing this
on-device.
