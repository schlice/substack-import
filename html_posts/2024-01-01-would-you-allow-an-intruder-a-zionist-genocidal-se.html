Of course not.

But if you will allow me, let me re-write your question to ***actually
fit reality:***

**Would you allow an intruder (Arabs) to register their claim on your
property (the ancestral homeland of the Jews) simply because they
conquered the land once?**

There. Fixed it for you.

So let's break down your characterizations and see where they are
flawed:

1.  You characterized Israel as "a Zionist genocidal settler-colonial
    state." This characterization is wrong on multiple levels.
    1.  While some Israelis may be "Zionists," not everyone in or out of
        Israel is.
    2.  Israelis are definitely not "genocidal." The population of Gaza
        *grew tenfold* over the time that they had a separate
        Palestinian state. If they are genocidal, they're absolutely
        terrible at it. Plus, they have the technology to turn Palestine
        into the world's largest parking lot, and they haven't done it
        yet. So I really dispute the characterization of Israel as
        "genocidal."
    3.  It's difficult to characterize Israel as a "settler-colonial
        state" as the first recorded people in that region were Jews in
        2000 BC. So seeing as "they were there first," it's really hard
        to call them "colonialists."
2.  You claimed Palestinians have a right to the property. That's only
    partially true. Arabs once conquered the land now known as Palestine
    (note that they conquered the Jews and took the land, as any
    invading nation would do), *but then the Jews took it back* (also by
    conquering). But the difference: the Jews allowed the Arabs to stay.
    So by the rules of war, the nation conquering the land has the
    "right" to the property.
3.  You claimed that the only reason Israel exists is because of the
    Jewish Scriptures. But as I already noted in 1c above, the Jews were
    actually there first, despite what they have written in their Torah.
    So their claim is actually supported by history, not just a book.
