If non-residents of Alabama voted in an Alabama election, according to
state law, those votes would be illegal.

To Democrats, you do whatever you need to do to win, because the only
thing that matters to Democrats is power. And it makes sense to smear
the other guy in order to win, because that falls in line with "whatever
you need to do." Attacking the other guy directly instead of addressing
the issues is par for the course for Democrats. Bringing in voters from
other states to vote in a state election would similarly be "whatever
you need to do."
