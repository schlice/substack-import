1.  If Straight Talk supports it, then you can sign up (and pay) for it.
2.  If you load a modded Android build (like CyanogenMod) onto your
    phone, it will support the mobile hotspot
3.  You can use third-party software to provide Internet access to other
    devices. May not be Wi-Fi, but you can do it.
