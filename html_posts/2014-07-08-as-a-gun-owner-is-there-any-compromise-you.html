**Content:** [First, thanks for being honest about your question, and I
understand it and it makes sense. As you well know, we have already
given up many of our rights and we\'re quite tired of continuing to do
so. But as you also know, every Right we have comes with an associated
Responsibility, and we must be allowed to legislate common-sense rules
that enforce those responsibilities. Finally, as you also know, the
biggest problem we have with violence is not guns, but the mentally
unstable people that wield them. Some of the things we must do:\

- We must find a way to balance privacy concerns and still be able to
  determine reliably whether or not someone is mentally unstable. If
  that means that mental illness is documented in NICS, so be it. But
  this also means that a single prescription for Xanax doesn\'t label
  you as \"mentally ill.\" This will require a major sea-change in the
  mental health industry, something that is going to take more than
  \"concessions by the pro-gun advocates\" to advance.
- Similarly, we must do a better job with how we treat the mentally
  deficient in our society. Do you know where the biggest mental
  facilities are in this country? The three biggest mental institutions
  in this country are prisons. Essentially, our legal system currently
  treats the mentally ill as criminals, and usually the system doesn\'t
  even kick in until there is a legal charge against them. If this does
  not change, it doesn\'t matter whether or not we vaporize all weapons
  with a single button-push, senseless killings will continue.
- If we can accomplish these things, we must be able to repeal some of
  the more stupid laws passed in the name of \"gun control\" like
  magazine size bans and remove restrictions on law-abiding citizens
  around the country owning and possessing firearms. States like
  Illinois and New York which all but completely ban private firearm
  ownership in any meaningful way should have their Draconian laws
  repealed.
- Gun laws should be normalized across the country. This quagmire of
  legal red-tape between states is exactly why we created a federal
  government in the first place. Federal concealed carry laws would be a
  great place to start.
- Allow our \"armed forces\" to carry arms. Some of our most highly
  trained weapons experts in the world are disarmed while in the US. How
  stupid is that? Do you think the tragedy in Fort Hood would have
  happened if our armed forces were actually \"armed\"?
