**If your neighbor is breaking multiple HOA rules, should you report
them to the HOA?**

That's really up to you. It depends on how egregious the violations are,
and how much they personally impact you.

We all understand that following the rules is the right thing to do, and
we should all do it. But whether or not you personally make the report
to the HOA of someone violating the rules is a personal decision that
only you can make. Remember, they're still your neighbor; you have to
live with them. If they discover who reported them, it could make for a
tense living situation if they get fined because of your report.

Perhaps you can make your report anonymously; that may help.
