Of course you can! Anyone who enjoys history can read the Bible as a
historical document and be interested in what it says.

Also, God doesn't define a standard for what is interesting. God defines
a standard for what is *good*. So you can be not religious and still
find the Bible and religion interesting.

However, there is one question that is relevant. *Can you be good
without God?* And the answer is yes, you can be good without God, but
you cannot claim that you can **know for certain what is good** without
God. Yes, this means that *atheists borrow from the theistic in order to
claim that they know what is good.*

Why? Any knowledge of what is bad implies that you know the standard for
good. And if there is no overarching standard for good that applies to
*all people*, then you can't universally say that something is *good* or
something else is *bad*. It's only good **for you**. If there is no
standard of good, then it may be good for you, and it may be bad for
someone else, *but you're both technically right if there is no
standard.* Therefore, you can't truly know what is *good*, it's only
good *for you*.

That's why we also say that life only has meaning if you believe in God.
Sure, you can *create* your own meaning in life, and that's fine,
there's nothing wrong with doing so. But you can't say that what you
have found meaning in is applicable to everyone. For example, an atheist
could say that they find meaning in learning and finding beauty in
nature. But he can't reasonably expect anyone else to do the same.
Ultimately, everything that the atheist enjoys is just confined to
themselves. That's a really, really lonely existence. Being
self-referential is incredibly lonely for creatures who were created for
connection. Again, you can say that you are fulfilled in life and your
life has all kinds of meaning, but it's all smoke and mirrors. It's not
the true connection that you have been designed for. And without God,
that loneliness will extend *for all eternity*.

But it will be so much worse, because even the atheists benefit from
living in a world with God today. When they die rejecting God, they will
be thrust into a world *without God*, something they haven't experienced
yet. So it won't be a continuation of what we have today. It will be
utter loneliness. It won't be a party of unbelievers. They're not going
to meet Hitler in Hell or some such nonsense like that. It will be *just
that one atheist*. No God. No one else. For all eternity. Because that's
what you choose when you choose to separate yourself from God.
