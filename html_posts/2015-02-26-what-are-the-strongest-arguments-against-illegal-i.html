**Content:** [*NOTE: This answer specifically addresses people who have
entered and/or remained in the United States illegally; in other words,
\"illegal aliens.\" There are lots of categories of aliens, but only
those who have entered and/or remained in the country illegally are the
ones I am discussing in this answer.*\

[[Charlie
Fortin](https://www.quora.com/profile/Charlie-Fortin)]{.qlink_container}
put a succinct answer together which talks about the pay gap between
legal and illegal workers. But I think it\'s best to stick with [[Lucas
Karl
Hahn](https://www.quora.com/profile/Lucas-Karl-Hahn)]{.qlink_container}\'s
point: they are **[illegal]{.underline}**.\
\
Is there any other country in the world that you can go to, squat for a
few years, and get all the privileges that any citizen in that country
gets? Free healthcare? Free education? Housing assistance? These things
really are free for the illegal alien, because they don\'t pay for any
of them. They pay sales tax, but that\'s not what pays for education,
housing, and healthcare. Your Federal taxes pay for those things.\
\
By the way, switching from an income-based tax system to a
consumption-based tax system would completely close the illegal
\"loophole\". Check out

\
If the first thing you do as a new citizen of a new country is to
*violate the laws of that new country*, you and I have a problem.\
\
I think that it\'s a cop-out to say \"but the waits are too long,\" or
\"but I\'ll never get in,\" or \"I don\'t want to learn English.\" Those
are excuses. Hundreds of thousands of people become naturalized US
citizens each and every year, and they do it legally. How must they feel
that they\'ve put in the effort, waited the appropriate time, and done
what they needed to do to become US citizens and others simply cut a
hole in a fence and waltz in to the country without so much as a wave
hello, and by the stroke of an executive pen, they magically become
citizens. Not cool, bro, not cool.\

{EDIT} [[Josh
Smith](https://www.quora.com/profile/Josh-Smith-142)]{.qlink_container}
advised me that \"illegal alien\" is redundant, since DHS uses the term
\"alien\" to identify someone who is not a US national, not \"illegal
alien\":\

> **Alien** - Any person not a citizen or national of the United States

\
I have edited my post and have changed \"illegal alien\" to simply
\"alien.\" Thanks for keeping me honest, Josh.\
\
{EDIT 2} As [[Victor
Eijkhout](https://www.quora.com/profile/Victor-Eijkhout)]{.qlink_container}
points out, \"alien\" applies to many different categories of people in
the United States who are not citizens, including foreign nationals who
are legally present in the country on a work visa. Therefore, \"illegal
alien\" is a correct term to indicate someone who is not a citizen or
national of the United States, and is in this country illegally (i.e.
not in a documented legal status). I edited my answer again. Sheesh
people, make up your mind.
