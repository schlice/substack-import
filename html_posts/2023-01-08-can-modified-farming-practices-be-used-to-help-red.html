I would have hoped that [[Scott
Strough](https://www.quora.com/profile/Scott-Strough)]{.qlink_container}
would have answered this question, but I believe he tires of answering
the same question that he has already effectively answered:

[[Scott Strough\'s answer to How can we combat climate
change?](/How-can-we-combat-climate-change/answers/34310028)]{.qlink_container}

If you think that modified farming practices can't reverse climate
trends, please do yourself a favor and read Scott's answer.
