Short answer: in most jurisdictions, yes.

Longer answer: You are making a statement, under oath, which you
actually swear to (in the military, when taking a statement, we actually
make them raise their hand and swear). You are swearing that the
information you give on the report is the truth, to the best of your
knowledge. You also are acknowledging that false reporting is a crime,
and if you are making a false report, you will be prosecuted.

Your signature affirms that you understand and agree to those
provisions. Those provisions are verbally explained to you, you are
given the opportunity to answer any questions about those provisions
that you may have, you are asked if you agree with the provisions, and
when you confirm verbally that you do, you then sign the form stating
that you were explained your rights and you made the statement
voluntarily, without duress or coercion.

The officer taking the report will get your full name and your legal
address from your driver\'s license or some other identifying document
so they can follow up with you.
