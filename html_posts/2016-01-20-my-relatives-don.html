Don\'t talk to them any more. Don\'t associate with them. Don\'t call
them. Don\'t send them Christmas cards. You might say a final goodbye to
them all in a letter so that they don\'t think you fell off the face of
the planet, but there is no reason that you can\'t tell them that you
don\'t have the time or energy to have anyone in your life who doesn\'t
like you, for any reason.

Relatives are often given a \"pass\" because they are \"family.\" I had
a family member steal from me, and the prevailing opinion among the rest
of the family was that I should give them a pass because they are
family. I instead excluded them from my life and did all the right
things, which eventually led to a police investigation, enough evidence
proffered to bring two felony charges, but the DA at the time chose not
to pursue those charges. It\'s been over ten years and they are no
longer a part of my life. I have to think of my kids. What kind of
message does it send when my relatives steal from me and I continue
associating with them? It says that relatives can abuse you and there
are no consequences. I love them, but I don\'t want to associate with
them.
