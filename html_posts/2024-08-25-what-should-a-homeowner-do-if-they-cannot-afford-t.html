You didn\'t mention whether or not this is \$12,000 for you, or is it
\$12,000 per homeowner across the entire HOA. My answer is in relation
to a \$12,000 special assessment per homeowner across the entire HOA.

**Work out a payment plan.**

Go to your Board of Directors and work out a payment plan with them.
Because a \$12,000 special assessment actually comes out to be about
\$300 a month for 3 years. I would be surprised if the Board didn\'t
already have a payment plan in place for all of the homeowners. \$12,000
is not an amount of money that most people simply have on hand. I
presume that there is some sort of payment plan already in place.

But if they don\'t, and they expect you to front the \$12,000 up front,
you can probably get a loan for that amount, and pay it back over 3
years, but that doesn\'t sound fair to me. I would think the Board would
be open to creating a payment plan for you. Unless of course the
\$12,000 assessment is for you only because you did something which
violated the rules that cost the HOA \$12,000, in which case you may
have to fund the loan yourself. For example, let\'s say you left a
faucet running in the common area and it caused \$12,000 worth of
damage. You would have to repay that, and the HOA can take it from you
in a special assessment. But that would be for you alone. In that case,
you would probably have to take out a loan yourself to pay them back.
But if it\'s an assessment for every homeowner in the entire
neighborhood, the HOA should be taking out the loan.

If the Board doesn\'t give you a repayment plan, you may need to hire an
attorney in order to challenge the Board in not creating a payment plan
for the assessment. However, if you can\'t afford the assessment, how
are you going to afford an attorney? You do it be getting together with
your neighbors. I presume that if you have trouble raising the \$12,000,
some of your neighbors probably also have trouble raising \$12,000. So
perhaps you and your neighbors can go in together on a lawyer to
pressure the HOA to create a payment plan for all of the homeowners.
They can spread that special assessment out over a number of years, and
then the HOA can take on the loan for the full amount, and use your
monthly payments to pay back the loan.

In actuality, when a large expense comes up for the HOA, that\'s what
they do. The HOA takes out the loan, and then they use a special
assessment spread out over a number of years for all of the homeowners
in order to repay the loan.
