HSCT (hematopoietic stem cell therapy) is a very dangerous and risky
procedure. People seem to think that you can take a shot of stem cells
and it will magically cure you. The current therapy is not this at all.

HSCT works in this way:

- Stem cells from the patient are harvested, genetically modified and
  reproduced in a lab.
- The patient is given high-dose chemotherapy to destroy their immune
  system as well as their bone marrow, where immune cells are produced.
- Once all of their immune system (and bone marrow) is completely gone,
  the patient's lab-grown stem cells are re-injected into their body.
- The stem cells form new bone marrow, which produces new immune cells.

During this time, the patient is extremely susceptible to disease, as
they essentially have no immune system. After the bone marrow re-grows
and the immune system starts to work again, the patient has to get new
vaccines to combat all the childhood diseases again, as if they were
"reborn." This is part of what makes this procedure so dangerous: there
is literally no immune system during that time. The patient must be
isolated in a clean environment (ICU, isolation) because of the danger
they are in.

For now, this therapy is reserved for people who have not responded to
any traditional therapies, and whose health warrants such invasive and
dangerous intervention.
