**Content:** [It looks like you need to file for patent protection.\
\
You can patent your idea if it\'s a process, a machine, an article of
manufacture, a composition of matter, or an improvement of any of these.
Abstract ideas, natural phenomenon, and inventions deemed not useful are
not eligible to be patented.\
\
The US Patent and Trademark Office has a list of what can and cannot be
patented. That\'s where I would start.\

\
Once you have patented your idea, it is protected from being copied. You
can disclose your patented idea. You can turn over your patented idea to
someone else using whatever terms you choose (i.e. payment, requirement
that your name be used with the idea, etc). But before you do that, I
strongly suggest you consult with a patent and trademark attorney to
ensure that what you want to happen is really what will
happen.]{.rendered_qtext}
