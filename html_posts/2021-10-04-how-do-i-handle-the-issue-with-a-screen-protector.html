1.  Don't use one. I know you're worried about your screen scratching,
    but the Samsung phones with in-display fingerprint sensors use
    Gorilla Glass, which doesn't start scratching until they encounter
    something on the Mohs hardness scale at level 6 (with deeper groves
    at level 7)\*. Anyway, only put your phone in your pocket, and keep
    your pockets clean, and you should be just fine.
2.  Use a PIN or passcode instead. An 8-digit passcode is just as secure
    as your fingerprint.
3.  Set up face detection. While you can do this, it is notoriously
    unreliable, and it is far too insecure as it does not use 3D face
    mapping like Apple's FaceID or Google's dual infrared cameras making
    a 3D representation of your face. This means you can hold up a
    picture of yourself and it will unlock your phone. So while you
    *can* do this, I recommend that you do not.
