The First Amendment protects free speech and expression by preventing
the government from writing laws which restrict free speech and
expression.

We also have specific categories of speech which are ***not*** protected
by the First Amendment. For example, **the First Amendment does not
protect speech that is intended to incite or produce imminent lawless
action and is likely to incite or produce such action**. This is known
as the "Brandenburg Test". The Brandenburg test is a legal test for
incitement that states that the government can only punish someone for
speech that incites violence.

The U.S. Supreme Court first defined "fighting words" in *Chaplinsky v
New Hampshire* (1942) as words which \"by their very utterance, \[...\]
tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace\".

Speech which incites violence can only be punished if the government can
prove that:

- The speaker intended for unlawful violence to occur
- Unlawful violence is likely to occur
- The unlawful violence is imminent

The Supreme Court established the Brandenburg test in the 1969 case
Brandenburg v. Ohio. In the case, a Ku Klux Klan leader gave a speech at
a rally to his fellow Klansmen. After listing a number of derogatory
racial slurs, he then said that "it\'s possible that there might have to
be some vengeance \[sic\] taken".

The Brandenburg test states that **the First Amendment does not protect
speech that is \"directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless
action and is likely to incite or produce such action\"**. A law that
forbids speech that is intended to cause imminent violence or other
criminal activity will pass the Brandenburg test and be deemed
constitutional.

There are three prongs which must be tested:

- **The speaker must intend to incite violence**. If I say something
  that is so beyond the pale to some people that they spontaneously are
  spurred to unlawful action, it is not the fault of the speaker if he
  did not intend for lawless action to take place following his words.
- **Unlawful violence is likely to occur**. I can say that I think
  people should all get in boats and storm Europe, but this wouldn't be
  incitement of violence because it is unlikely that this will happen.
- **The unlawful violence is imminent**. I could say that people should
  all someday stand up to law enforcement and kill all those pigs, but
  that's legal because the unlawful violence is "someday," not "right
  now, go attack that cop over there". The unlawful violence must be
  imminent.

So we do have laws which protect against speech which incites violence.

You also mentioned when speech is offensive. I went back and re-read the
Constitution (it's not really all that long) and I can't find any right
to never be offended. So I'm pretty sure that the First Amendment does
not protect against offensive speech.

In fact, I'd say that *the whole reason we have a First Amendment is to
protect speech that other people won't like!* If your speech is kind and
caring, if your speech "ruffles no feathers," there is no need to
restrict it. If all speech was always amenable and agreeable, we would
never need a First Amendment.

I would argue that we need the First Amendment *to protect offensive
speech*. Sometimes, the things we say cause others to be offended.
Sometimes, we intend that reaction (which is quite evil, but that's not
the point). Most times, we don't intend that reaction. We simply intend
to make a point, but others may find that point offensive. If we are not
intending to be offensive, it is the hearer who has the problem, not the
speaker.

Regardless, the First Amendment has nothing to do with offense, because
you do not have a right to never be offended.
