**How can a homeowner fight an eminent domain proposition?**

First and foremost, if your property is affected, hire an eminent domain
lawyer. Not in a month, not in a week, now.

The 5th Amendment gives the government the power to take property.
However, like most provisions in the Constitution, it is not an
unlimited power. For example, the taking must be valid and legal. If it
is not, your eminent domain attorney can help you fight that.

If it is valid and legal, your lawyer will make sure you get full and
fair compensation for any property taken.

This is why it is critical that if you are affected by an eminent domain
action, you immediately retain an eminent domain attorney.
