To answer your specific question, he's the Commander in Chief. That
means he's the boss. And since there is no one else in the military's
food chain higher than him, I don't think there's anyone who can really
stop him from doing as he pleases with the military.

But probably what's more interesting is *why* he's doing it. I'm
surprised you haven't read Obama's manifesto. "Little Donny" has. That
manifesto would be *Rules for Radicals* by Saul Alinsky. Yes, Trump has
read it. And yes, he's totally using it against you. It's the book that
essentially defined the entire eight years of the Obama administration.
And Trump is using it.

He's using Twitter to enrage you. He's calling out the media in general
(and CNN in specific) and isolating them. He's using ridicule, which
Alinsky says is "the most powerful weapon of all." And it's working
(clearly).

The parade idea is no different. It is literally infuriating not only
everyone on the Left, but all of his enemies, worldwide. So I guess the
tactic continues to work.

I'm surprised you haven't read it. Because if you did, you'd see that
Trump's actions aren't unconsidered or brash or boorish. They're
straight out of the book.
