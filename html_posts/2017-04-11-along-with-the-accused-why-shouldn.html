In addition to all the great answers here, the police are not charged
with preventing crime. They enforce the law, which means they bring
violators to justice. In order to be brought to justice, you have to
violate the law first. The police do not prevent people from violating
the law; they simply bring those who do to appear before the court to
answer for what they did.

Many Supreme Court decisions have found that not only is it not the
police's job to prevent crime, the police also have no *specific duty*
to protect any one individual. For example, if you got carjacked and
someone in your party was shot, can you sue the police for failing to
protect you? Many have tried. The cases that got to the Supreme Court
have all shown that the police do not have a specific duty to protect
you; they have a general duty to protect the public at large. Unless
some specific arrangement was made beforehand (i.e. you were in police
custody, etc), the police do not have a duty to defend you.
