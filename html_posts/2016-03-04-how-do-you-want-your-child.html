Our school district will send automated messages via whatever method(s)
we choose: email, text message, and/or phone calls playing a
pre-recorded message. Based on the severity of the message, you can
choose how the message is delivered. For example, my routine messages
are only delivered by e-mail; urgent messages are delivered by all three
methods to ensure I don\'t miss them.

Ideally, if there was action required of the parents (something as
simple as school closing early because of weather, or as complex and
panic-inducing as schools closing early because of a bomb threat), the
school would already have a pick-up plan in place and parents would be
directed to that location.

Active shooter situations evolve much more quickly, but the response by
the school is the same: inform as much as possible, direct parents what
to do and what not to do.

For example, while the active shooter situation is ongoing:

\"This is a message from \<your_school_district\>. There is currently an
active incident at \<your_child\'s_school\> and we are evacuating
students at this time. Please DO NOT COME TO THE SCHOOL since we need to
minimize traffic to allow local law enforcement response. We will
contact you again shortly with a pick-up location.\"

Then, when the pick-up location has been determined:

\"This is a message from \<your_school_district\>. The students at
\<your_child\'s_school\> are being evacuated to \<evacuation_location\>.
Please report to this location now to pick up your child. Please do not
leave without ensuring that your child is accounted for.\"
