No.

The definition of murder is to unlawfully take a life. You could also
say that murder is the taking of a life without justification.

Thus, taking a life *with justification* is not murder. It is
**homicide** (the killing of a human), but it is *justified homicide*
(which we call "justifiable homicide," or the taking of a life with
justification).

Murder is specifically taking a life without justification.
