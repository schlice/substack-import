**Content:** [As far as the near-term goes, likely nothing.\
\
VMware was spun off from EMC, but EMC retained 81% of their stake in the
company, which was part of the prize that Dell was going for. Part of
the purchase deal for EMC was buying out all those VMware shares, and
providing tracking stocks to current EMC shareholders to compensate for
the loss of the indirect ownership of VMware.\
\
Dell intends to keep VMware a publicly traded company. EMC, on the other
hand, will lose its public trading status and become part of Dell, which
is privately held.\
\
Long term? I can\'t see why VMware wouldn\'t fit nicely into Dell\'s
goal to move out of the PC space and into the Enterprise space, which is
the whole objective of the EMC purchase anyway. But I\'m truly just
speculating here.]{.rendered_qtext}
