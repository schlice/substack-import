**Does it take a majority in both houses of Congress to impeach a
President?**

No.

It takes a **simple majority in the House of Representatives** to
impeach a President.

It takes a **supermajority in the Senate** to *then* remove the
President from office.

The Senate is a check against partisan impeachments in the House. You
would think that this would be enough to dissuade a rogue House from
filing a biased, one-sided, partisan impeachment, but when you want to
use impeachment as an election ploy instead of to combat high crimes and
misdemeanors, facts don't matter.
