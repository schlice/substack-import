**In 2013 25,000 federal workers successfully sued for damages because
they were forced to work without pay. Will 2018-19 workers do the same?
Do they have a similar case?**

*If* a government worker was **forced** to work without pay (i.e. they
were in a *non-essential* job and they were told that they had to work
or they'd lose their job, or they were in an *essential job* and were
told that they had to work without pay), then they should again sue for
damages, and will again likely win.
