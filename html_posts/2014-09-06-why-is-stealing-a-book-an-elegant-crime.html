<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Your logic is very Machiavellian: the ends justify the<br>means. The acquisition of knowledge being a moral good justifies your<br>theft of the book, a moral wrong.\<br>\<br>While the acquisition of knowledge is a moral good, it does not justify<br>the theft of someone else\'s property, a moral wrong. It will take more<br>critical thinking to determine a way to get the knowledge from the book<br>in a way that does not constitute theft. For example, borrowing it from<br>the library could achieve the same moral good without the theft. You<br>could borrow the book from someone, and as long as it is returned, the<br>crime is eliminated.\<br>\<br>There are non-profit foundations that provide free and reduced books to<br>the community; one of these may have the book for you to borrow or keep,<br>the cost borne by them.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
