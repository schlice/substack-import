**Content:** [Your logic is very Machiavellian: the ends justify the
means. The acquisition of knowledge being a moral good justifies your
theft of the book, a moral wrong.\
\
While the acquisition of knowledge is a moral good, it does not justify
the theft of someone else\'s property, a moral wrong. It will take more
critical thinking to determine a way to get the knowledge from the book
in a way that does not constitute theft. For example, borrowing it from
the library could achieve the same moral good without the theft. You
could borrow the book from someone, and as long as it is returned, the
crime is eliminated.\
\
There are non-profit foundations that provide free and reduced books to
the community; one of these may have the book for you to borrow or keep,
the cost borne by them.]{.rendered_qtext}
