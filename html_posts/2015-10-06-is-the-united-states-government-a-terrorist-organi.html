**Content:** [A terrorist organization uses fear to meet political ends.
Terrorists will usually use illegal, sensational acts of violence to
frighten (terror) people into making political change. They will almost
always take responsibility for their crimes, and indicate that such
crimes will continue until their demands are met.\
\
The United States is engaged in a legal conflict known as the Global War
on Terror (the GWOT). As the article rightly states, the US military
uses every possible shred of evidence it can find, as is gathered by the
CIA, the NSA, and other intelligence-gathering organizations. Most of
the people killed in drone strikes are indeed militants.\
\
But on occasion, even the best intelligence can be wrong. The hospital
in Kunduz was one such accident. Sometimes these things can be
attributed to the \"fog of war.\" The US was responding to an Afghan
call for an airstrike, and it\'s still unsure whether or not we targeted
the facility that the Afghanis requested we target. If militants had
taken up position within the hospital, the hospital becomes a valid
target under the Geneva Convention. We don\'t know whether or not this
is completely true. Doctors Without Borders claims that all people who
were killed were either hospital workers or patients. But this claim has
not yet been fully substantiated. The Afghanis have not stated yet which
building they indicated for strike and whether or not there was a reason
to target a hospital if they did, in fact, request an airstrike on the
hospital. This is still subject to investigation.\
\
You do have to rely on your intelligence to execute an operation, and it
is true that sometimes, there are mistakes made. The White House has
said, through its spokesman, Josh Earnest, \"There is no country in the
world and no military in the world that goes to greater lengths and
places a higher premium on avoiding civilian casualties than the United
States Department of Defense.\"\
\
Calling the United States a \"terrorist organization\" would mean that
we routinely and **knowingly** engage in illegal acts of violence for
the sole reason of enacting political ends. You would have to have
information stating that the US ***knew*** that the hospital did not
contain any militants, that it was not a valid target under the Geneva
Convention, and the military commanders made a decision to destroy that
hospital anyway, in order to effect political change. Then, you will
have to show that the US ***admitted*** to killing all of the civilians,
and then that the US ***demanded*** a particular political end or more
civilians in non-combat areas would be intentionally targeted.\
\
Since this is not happening and is not likely to ever happen, you cannot
call the United States a terrorist organization and be speaking from any
platform of fact.]{.rendered_qtext}
