**How do I transfer my Samsung tablet SIM card to my Samsung phone?**

While you can move the physical SIM from one device to the other, the
plans may be different.

Usually, tablets and wearables are on different plans than smartphones.
You generally can't swap between the two, because the plans suitable for
tablets are not suitable for smartphones.
