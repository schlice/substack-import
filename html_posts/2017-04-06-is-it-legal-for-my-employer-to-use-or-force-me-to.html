There may have been a monitoring requirement when you installed your
company's app. That's part of those pesky EULAs and TOSs (which stand
for End User License Agreement and Terms of Service) that you never read
and just click "I Agree." You would have to go back to the EULA and the
TOS and see if you agreed to have your personal phone inspected on
demand.

Doing this (checking the EULA and the TOS) will tell you whether or not
they were legally allowed to demand that you unlock your phone and take
screenshots of the company's app.

If there is nothing that you agreed to which says that you must unlock
your phone on demand, then no one can force you to unlock your personal
phone. Not even the police. Unless:

1.  A judge orders you to unlock your phone. Failing to do so will cause
    you to be held in contempt of court until you decide to comply with
    the judge's order.
2.  The police have a warrant to search the contents of your phone. If
    you don't unlock it for them, they will take it and hack into it,
    regardless of how long that might take (such as in the case of the
    San Bernardino shooter's iPhone).

In all practicality, there is no need for anyone to ever have to look at
your phone. Your phone interacts with a server, which stores all the
same information. Your company can simply check the server to see
exactly what you see. Nevertheless, it's all up to what you agreed to
when you installed the app.

It's water under the bridge now; you already unlocked your phone
voluntarily. But check the EULA and the TOS to see if they can do it
next time.
