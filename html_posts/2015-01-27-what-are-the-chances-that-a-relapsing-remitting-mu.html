**Content:** [Solumedrol is the brand name for methylprednisone, a
corticosteroid. Corticosteroids do not treat MS. They help to reduce the
severity of the symptoms that an MS patient experiences during a
\"relapse\" (the \"relapse\" portion of the \"relapsing-remitting\"
version of MS). There is some evidence to suggest that corticosteroids
lose their effectiveness over time, but most patients still experience
some faster symptom relief when they are used.\
\
Left untreated with one of the approved MS therapies, RRMS will progress
to SPMS (Secondary Progressive MS) in about 10 years, on average. The
speed of progression in SPMS as well as the degree of disability
experienced is different in every patient. Better than two-thirds of
SPMS patients retain the ability to walk, although they may need an
ambulation aid such as a cane or walker in order to do it. Some may
choose to use a wheelchair or motorized scooter to conserve energy,
others may need to use a wheelchair full-time (*statistics courtesy of*
