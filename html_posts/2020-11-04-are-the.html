No, the found votes are not necessarily proof that fraud has taken
place.

They are, however, proof that mail-in voting is a medium rife for abuse,
and a vivid demonstration that mail-in voting is not nearly as "safe" or
"secure" as everyone has been saying it is.

Do we have proof? Not really. We have never had widespread mail-in
voting. Some states have all mail-in balloting, but if they believe
their system is good, they're not going to be looking very closely for
problems. Additionally, people claim that mail-in balloting is safe
because it's always been safe, and that's not entirely accurate. We have
had *absentee balloting* in the past, not widespread mail-in voting. And
your mail-in voting system is only as secure as your requirements on
voters.

This is why we should go back to the original system, and limit absentee
ballots to those who will physically be outside of the state on Election
Day, or who are physically incapable of going to a polling place on
Election Day.

**TL;DR:** **mail-in voting makes your election less secure and more
susceptible to malicious and accidental tampering.**

Original question:

**Are the \"found\" votes in MI, WI, and PA proof of the fraud involved
in mail-in voting?**
