**How do you send data from one phone to another?**

This is a challenging question to answer, because much of the answer
will depend on the type of data as well as the platform, and whether you
own both of the phones (i.e. they're logged in to the same accounts) or
not.

I'd like a little more information before I can answer the question
correctly. Use the "Comment" button (the bubble just underneath the
question) to add some more detail so we can help:

- What phones are we talking about (i.e. model of phone: two iPhones, an
  iPhone and an Android, etc)?
- Do you own both phones (i.e. are they logged in to the same accounts)?
