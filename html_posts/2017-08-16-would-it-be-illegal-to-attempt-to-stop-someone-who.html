Wow, you could fill Quora with questions if you asked one question at a
time. So let's break down and see what we can do here.

> *Would it be illegal to attempt to stop someone who is committing a
> violent crime? What about non-violent crimes?*

Not trying to be obsequious, but the answer is "it depends." Mostly, it
depends on the crime. Violent crimes against the person (such as the big
ones: murder, rape, robbery, or kidnapping) are ones in which you can
usually intervene on behalf of the victim with force, even up to and
including deadly force. But as always, this varies by jurisdiction.
Additionally, such use of force and its subsequent "defense of others"
claim, is an "affirmative defense," which means you accede to committing
the violence against the aggressor, but you then claim self-defense (in
the form of defense of another) as your defense.

In the case of a crime against property or a non-violent crime, you do
not have the affirmative defense of defense of another to rely on, so
under normal circumstances, you cannot attempt to stop someone
committing such a crime. You would either have to use force against them
(which is a crime), or you would have to hold them against their will in
a particular location until the police arrived (which is false
imprisonment). You could make a "citizen's arrest," but the laws around
citizen's arrest, and what you are allowed and not allowed to do during
them, are wildly variable depending on where you are. So much so that it
is almost advisable to *not* perform one, as you take on a tremendous
amount of personal liability if you don't strictly follow the local laws
to do so, and you face a tremendous legal battle even if you do. In such
a case, I always advocate the "be a good witness" approach. Take note of
all of the who/what/when/where/how question details, and record as much
as you can on your phone. Turn your evidence over to the police, who are
not encumbered with the same set of legal challenges to using force to
effect arrest as you are.

Now that we've answered that, the other questions should answer
themselves quite easily:

> *Could it fall under self-defense even if you were not directly
> affected?*

As we've mentioned, defense of others falls under self-defense in most
jurisdictions.

> *Could the criminal bring charges against me for intervening?*

I would virtually expect the criminal (through his lawyer) to do just
that every time. Since you are not a police officer, you are not
specifically charged with stopping crime, and you don't have the legal
protections that a duly sworn peace officer does in enforcing the law.
This means you're operating within the realm of "citizen's arrest," and
as we've mentioned, the laws are wildly variable. Some citizen's arrest
statutes allow you to use some force, but most do not allow you to use
any force, to effect the arrest. Some require announcement of citizen's
arrest, some do not. You would have to know the law in your area very
well, follow it to the letter, and *still* expect the criminal to sue
you in civil court. Expect a hairy and expensive legal fight.
