**How do you remove a stuck battery from a Dell Latitude laptop? One of
the sliding tabs is difficult to move.**

Do not attempt to remove a stuck battery from a Latitude laptop. If you
cannot remove the battery with your fingers only (don't try to use tools
to pry the battery out), contact Dell Technical Support. Attempting to
use tools to remove the battery could result in a pierced battery and a
dangerous leak of battery acid.

All Dell laptops come standard with one year of mail-in support. You can
check your warranty status on [[our
website](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=347c64&url=https://www.dell.com/support/article/SLN153567/en){.external_link

you can still contact Dell Technical Support who will diagnose your
problem and provide you a quote to repair it. Once the quote is
accepted, the technician will assist you with sending your laptop to
Dell for repair.
