**As of 2019, what is the central argument why the catholic church does
not allow women to become priests?**

There is, and always has been, a very clear Biblical argument for gender
roles. That some churches actively choose to ignore these biblical
commands comes down to what I'd call "creative interpretation" of
several key women figures in the Bible, and a willful ignorance of the
truth of God's plan as laid out in the Bible.

So let's start with a few norms:

- The Bible never contradicts itself.
- The Bible tells us that sometimes, God turns things upside-down to
  make a point.
- Any prohibition on women ruling is not an argument that women are not
  equal or capable. It is an argument that there is an order that was
  established in the Bible, and God had His reasons for doing so.

There are five clear, biblical reasons why women should not rule.

- **Teleological:** women exercising headship violates the creation
  design, for Adam was formed first, and then Eve (cf. 1 Timothy 2:13).
  Thus, the prohibitions on women exercising headship in families and
  congregations are not arbitrary restrictions over specific domains,
  but merely two instances of a broader teleological principle.
- **A fortiori:** nations are comprised of collections of households. If
  a woman is not to exercise headship over one household (1 Peter
  3:5--6), how much less should she exercise headship over many
  households?
- **Exegetical:** Scripture describes the rulership of women over a
  nation as a curse, akin to being defeated by children (Isaiah 3:12,
  4). A curse is a fitting inversion of God's intended order, as a
  judgment on rebellion against it (cf. Romans 1:18ff).
- **Inductive:** Women are not to exercise headship in the assembly (1
  Timothy 2:12). The assembly is a kingdom and a nation (e.g. 1 Peter
  2:9). Therefore, women are not to exercise headship in kingdoms or
  nations generally.
- **Missional:** Israel, and now the church, are God's models for a
  rightly ordered society (Deuteronomy 4:6--8; Psalm 19:7; Matthew 5--7
  etc), which is why we are commanded to teach all the nations to
  conform to this model (Matthew 28:18--20). Thus, Christians must
  preach all the nations to reject female heads of state.

But, I can hear the question forming in your head...

***What about Deborah?***

Deborah is the Biblical figure that feminists trot out every time
someone (much less a *man*, ugh) says that women should not rule.

Bringing up Deborah is a classic example of going to the edge to avoid
the center. When people hate something God loves, they cast around for
extraordinary cases to make it look bad. For example, we know a person
secretly hates children when their response to criminalizing abortion
is, "But what about victims of rape or incest?"

But looking at Deborah is worthwhile. While she is the only case of a
woman ruling in the Bible that feminists can use, it only takes one
example to disprove the negative that women should not rule.

So what should we think about Deborah?

Go back to my norms. The Bible never contradicts itself, and sometimes,
God turns things upside-down to prove a point. Exceptional cases in the
Bible are not generally normative or declarative. Isaiah walking around
naked for three years isn't an exhortation to spend your life in a
nudist camp. It doesn't undermine the scriptural injunctions against
nakedness, but instead *reinforces* them. It does this by calling
attention to something feminists don't understand well: ***shame***.
Isaiah was a walking billboard for Israel's shame.

There are other examples (i.e. when Hosea married a prostitute, that
didn't undermine Proverbs' exhortation against marrying harlots, but
displayed Israel's dishonoring of God), but suffice it to say that when
you find a Biblical example that goes against a Scriptural norm, perhaps
you should ask yourself whether or not it is trying to draw attention to
it in order to display shame.

So, back to Deborah. We can read God's raising up of her in one of two
ways:

1.  God is exalting women rulers.
2.  God is *exhorting against* women rulers.

People tend to assume the first. Deborah was a good leader, therefore
women should rule. But if we look at the Bible as a whole, and we
understand that in the Bible, there is a God-ordained patriarchy,
Deborah's good leadership fits just as well with the second.

Just like Isaiah's nakedness, Deborah's rule emphasizes the very same
thing: Israel's shame. In Deborah's case, Israel has so totally failed
to represent God's plan, dishonoring themselves, that a woman had to
lead.

**The shame of Deborah's leadership isn't because women shouldn't lead.
It's because men** ***should*.**

The good example Deborah sets doesn't contradict the exhortation of
men's leadership. It draws attention to it by displaying the contrast
between the moral state of the men who *should* have been ruling Israel,
and the woman who *was*.

To reiterate, God sometimes turns things upside-down to prove a point.
It is at least possible that God raised up Deborah to highlight Israel's
shame.

If you're reading this and just fuming because of the example of great
women like Carly Fiorina or Meg Whitman or Marissa Mayer, these are
women exercising authority in matters of production. In the Bible, women
naturally held these positions. Don't forget that in Biblical times,
there were no corporations; there weren't standalone businesses (for the
most part) which existed outside the home. The household was the
primitive unit for society. The mission of the household was to expand
and carry on God's work of establishing a right order in the world.

The virtuous woman in Proverbs 31 is a businesswoman. She plants a
vineyard and sells the fruit. She bought the field she planted on. She
makes linens and trades them to merchants. But she does all of this not
as her own boss, or as an employee, but as a *wife*, a part of a team. A
wife would have authority over servants and unmarried sons. But her
authority was not one of judgement over moral matters, but rather over
affairs of utility. Production is a separate issue from justice. Both
are about ordering the world, but they are separate entities.

When the Bible exhorts against women ruling, it is exhorting against
them acting as representatives of God as father and king, not against
them representing God at all, otherwise they would not be made in the
image of God. Women are designed specifically to *complete* man's
representation of God, by filling and refining the world.

The idea of women leading corporations clearly presents a Biblical
problem. The idea of women working in production is not new and has
existed since Biblical times. But the idea of women working in
production *outside of the household* is extraordinary and novel. And it
is against the Biblical design. It's no wonder, then, that [[women have
been getting progressively
unhappier](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f4c71b&url=https://www.nber.org/papers/w14969){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="nber.org"}]{.qlink_container} as they have been
progressively "empowered" in the workplace.

To be clear, having a woman CEO is not necessarily an issue, because
production is both a male and female task. A female executive is not
necessarily representing God's father-rule. The problem is not the
woman, but the business. It is *the business itself* which has caused
the household and the production to become separated, and this creates
some difficulties for women to negotiate. It *masculinizes* many women
(i.e. short hair, pantsuits, bossy attitudes). If it is at all possible,
and in today's society it is usually not, it is far better for women to
run the production in the business of their own households, rather than
the business in an emaciated household-knockoff.

**TL;DR: The Christian church is therefore right in not allowing women
in leadership roles (and specific to the question, the Catholic church
is right in not allowing women priests). Deborah's example is in the
Bible to show us not that women are not good leaders, but that** ***men
should be good leaders*.**

*Again, I have to stress: this is a* ***Biblical*** *interpretation. If
you do not believe in the authority of the Bible, then none of this
relates at all to your worldview.*

*Even if you do believe in the Bible, this in no way is meant to
denigrate women or say that women should not be empowered to do whatever
they choose to do in life. It is simply a description of what the*
***Bible*** *says about what women were designed to do. If you don't
believe that women were designed, then none of this should apply to your
worldview.*

*I'm always willing to entertain respectful dissent and commentary,
which is why I generally leave comments open. But try to denigrate me or
disrespect my beliefs, or violate BNBR in any way, and you'll be
reported and your comments will be summarily frog-marched to the airlock
(i.e. I won't tolerate it and I'll delete your stuff).*
