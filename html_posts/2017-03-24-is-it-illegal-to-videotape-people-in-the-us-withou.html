Along with what everyone else says, it sounds like you're talking about
school (probably high school or possibly middle school). Your ability to
record videos are also subject to your school's rules, which are tighter
than local laws.

Besides the fact that your videos probably won't help you at all, they
may be restricted by your school.

A better tack to take would be to talk to your teacher about it rather
than resorting to video recordings. Explain that your group is not doing
any work and either ask to be transferred to another group, or ask to do
the project on your own. I'd rather be 100% responsible for all the work
than to be 100% responsible for the whole group's work AND carry the
rest of the group along.
