**If, say, a president admits to a crime in an off-the-record interview,
is the reporter legally required to inform the authorities?**

No.

In the United States, citizens do not have an affirmative "duty to
report" a crime. There are some professions which do have a duty to
report (i.e. health care workers have a duty to report child abuse and
neglect should they discover it as part of an examination), but most
citizens do not have a duty to report crimes they become aware of.
Reporters do not have any mandatory duty to report crimes they learn of,
either.

There are a few states that impose that similar duty to report on
civilians for crimes like sexual abuse (two, IIRC), but it is very
limited, and it has never been prosecuted.
