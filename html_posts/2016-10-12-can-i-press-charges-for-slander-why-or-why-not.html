(US Answer)

In most states, the offense is called **defamation** or **defamation of
character**. The statement must be false, and you also have to show harm
was caused by the lie.

There is also a category of defamation called **defamation** ***per
se*** in which there is no requirement to show harm, only that the
statement was made. There are four categories of defamation *per se*:
(i) accusing someone of a crime; (ii) alleging that someone has a foul
or loathsome disease; (iii) adversely reflecting on a person\'s fitness
to conduct their business or trade; and (iv) imputing serious sexual
misconduct.[\[1\]](#BzWqD){#cite-BzWqD .citation_link}

In most states, this is a civil offense. But in 17 US states and two
territories, there are laws which criminalize defamation.

Truth is always a defense to a defamation charge. This means that even
if a statement would be defamation if it were false, if the defense
could establish that the statement was actually true, a defamation claim
could not survive.
