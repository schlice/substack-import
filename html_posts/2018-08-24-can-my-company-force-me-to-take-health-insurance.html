**Can my company force me to take health insurance?**

No, your company cannot force you to buy health insurance. Let's say,
for example, you're a retired military veteran who has served at least
20 years on active duty. In that case, you have healthcare for life from
the military and you do not need health insurance from your company. You
could also be using your spouse's insurance to cover your health needs.

There are plenty of reasons why you would not want to buy health
insurance from your company.

Your company should be pleased with this, as it's not cheap to insure
someone. During your company's "open enrollment" period, you will have
the option to buy health insurance, or "opt out" and receive a portion
of that money back in your paycheck.
