**Content:** [NOTE: I don\'t believe the A-10 should be mothballed. I
think the Army should fly it. But that\'s my personal opinion and my
\"if I were king for a day\" wish.\
\
The Air Force position:\
]{.rendered_qtext}

- There are other aircraft in the inventory that can effectively perform
  the Close-Air Support (CAS) role, like the F-15E, the F-16 and the
  F-22. The A-10 is a single-mission aircraft.\
- The money is needed for the F-35A, which will be operational in 2016.
- The face of warfare is changing. Improved anti-aircraft capabilities
  and laser guided munitions threaten the stagnant design of the A-10.

Dissenters believe that the A-10 is the most capable CAS aircraft we
have (which it is) and that cutting it will put ground troops at risk.
Air Force senior staff notes that, along with the points listed above,
field commanders continually cite surveillance, reconnaissance, and
intelligence as the largest shortfalls we face in the field. CAS is a
lower priority in terms of combat operation \"pain points.\"\
\
General Mark A. Welsh, current Chief of Staff of the Air Force, himself
a former A-10 pilot, says \"We used the standard DoD planning scenarios.
The results very clearly showed that cutting the A-10 fleet was the
lowest-risk option, from an operational perspective, of a bunch of bad
options. While no one is happy, from a military perspective, it\'s the
right decision, and it\'s representative of the extremely difficult
choices that we\'re facing in the budget today.\" (*Checkpoints,* Dec,
