Not at first, but once it gained some altitude, they undoubtedly saw it,
long before it breached the ADIZ.

The question, of course, is why didn\'t they shoot it down. And the
answer to that question is probably far more political than military.

There\'s probably not much you can believe coming out of Washington
these days, but one thing is absolutely certain. If that balloon posed
any actual, physical, kinetic threat to the people of the United States,
it would have been shot down over the ocean before it even arrived at
our shores.

From there, the real reason why it was allowed to continue on its
journey gets a little bit murky. The truth of the matter is, even if it
is an intelligence gathering device, it is not any more advanced than
the spy satellites that China already has flying over the United States.
So they can\'t gain any new or different information using this method.

So then why wasn\'t it simply destroyed?

Politics.

Even though China allowed this balloon to breach our sovereign airspace,
China would undoubtedly claim force majeure, and sure enough, they did.
Therefore, if we shot it down because we claim that China was
deliberately violating our airspace, China\'s force majeure statement
would immediately be followed by the downing of the balloon being seen
by China as a hostile act, an overt act of war.

Compound this with the threat that falling debris poses to people on the
ground along with the fact that *capturing* the unit intact would be far
more valuable than *destroying* it.

Another very real possibility is that our current leadership in the
White House is simply vapor locked when it comes to dealing with China.
They couldn\'t make a decision if they had to, and by the time they had
come to some consensus, the balloon had already breached the mainland
and was flying over populated areas.

Whatever the reason they chose not to shoot it down, we can be certain
of a few things. It\'s no threat to us on the ground. Its intelligence
gathering capability is not any greater than any of their spy satellites
that they already have, which makes its presence here even more
bewildering. But ultimately, there\'s no denying that capturing the unit
intact would be far more valuable to us, intelligence-wise, then
destroying it.

Believe it or not, the US actually may be playing the long game here. In
other words, China is playing checkers, while the United States is
playing 4D chess.
