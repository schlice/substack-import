"God-fearing" is a phrase which usually means understanding the awesome
power of the Creator of the Universe, the being who literally put the
breath that you breathe into your lungs and has the power to wipe you
from existence such that no one would ever know you were there. It is
understanding and respecting the power of the Almighty. It means living
in awe, respect, obedience, and submission to God's authority.

Fear has at its roots both awe and terror. So it's understandable how
some people could read "God-fearing" and think that you are to be afraid
of God. People are afraid of things all the time, like snakes and
spiders, and they are afraid of those things because they can *hurt
them.* But this is unjustified with God, as He would never hurt you.

*But He's all-powerful! He might send me to hell!*

Actually no, He doesn't send anyone to hell. **You send yourself to
hell** by disobeying God. He doesn't condemn you to punishment. You
condemn yourself to punishment by refusing to repent of your sin. God
simply refuses to abide sinners. And if you haven't taken care of
business and repented of your sin, God is going to remove you from His
presence and send you away. That's not God punishing you. That's you
punishing yourself. It's not just a word game. The punishment is all in
your hands. It's not like you could be humming along thinking you're
saved and then God smites you. That's only true in Hollywood. In
reality, whether or not you are saved is totally up to you.
