<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [You\'re talking about the Insurrection Act (which allows
the President to deploy troops to quell an insurrection that the
fully-constituted forces of the States cannot control), but the rules
under which Insurrection attach are very narrow. No President would risk
violating a law which is nearly as old as the nation itself.\
\
Posse Comitatus has been widely interpreted (and the military is
instructed similarly) as preventing the military from performing any
policing actions within the country. For example, the military assisting
the DEA with drug enforcement is very much disallowed, but since there
is some overlap with other laws, some intelligence sharing is allowed,
especially following 9/11.\
\
The law is so restrictive that it is a hindrance when the military is
called to perform humanitarian missions within the borders. For example,
using military forces following a natural disaster is mostly forbidden,
which is why most stateside response happens through the National
Guard.\
\
The National Guard is also not DoD; they work expressly for a State
governor. They are not under the control of the President.\
\
The Coast Guard is not DoD; they are DHS, so the law does not apply to
them. They have a peacetime patrol and protection function, and they
also have a wartime function which would matrix with DoD should there be
war on US soil. Posse Comitatus does not apply to them
either.]{.rendered_qtext}
