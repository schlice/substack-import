<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [You\'re talking about the Insurrection Act (which allows<br>the President to deploy troops to quell an insurrection that the<br>fully-constituted forces of the States cannot control), but the rules<br>under which Insurrection attach are very narrow. No President would risk<br>violating a law which is nearly as old as the nation itself.\<br>\<br>Posse Comitatus has been widely interpreted (and the military is<br>instructed similarly) as preventing the military from performing any<br>policing actions within the country. For example, the military assisting<br>the DEA with drug enforcement is very much disallowed, but since there<br>is some overlap with other laws, some intelligence sharing is allowed,<br>especially following 9/11.\<br>\<br>The law is so restrictive that it is a hindrance when the military is<br>called to perform humanitarian missions within the borders. For example,<br>using military forces following a natural disaster is mostly forbidden,<br>which is why most stateside response happens through the National<br>Guard.\<br>\<br>The National Guard is also not DoD; they work expressly for a State<br>governor. They are not under the control of the President.\<br>\<br>The Coast Guard is not DoD; they are DHS, so the law does not apply to<br>them. They have a peacetime patrol and protection function, and they<br>also have a wartime function which would matrix with DoD should there be<br>war on US soil. Posse Comitatus does not apply to them<br>either.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Does-the-concept-of-protecting-ourselves-from-government-tyranny-imply-shooting-police-officers-and-military-personnel/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
