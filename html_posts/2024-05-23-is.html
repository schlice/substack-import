I get it, it seems a little bit simple.

Think of it as the "small talk" at the beginning of a relationship. If
you are both interested, you'll probably go deeper in your discussions,
but for the time being, you're keepin' it simple.

It's marketing. You need a simple message to set the hook. Religious
people are notoriously bad about marketing, so this is foreign to us.
That's why it seems so odd.
