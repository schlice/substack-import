As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."

Depending on where you live, you either committed a misdemeanor, or no
crime at all.

Most states leave it up to the city or county to determine what type of
firearms discharge is legal. Some states have taken that entire
responsibility and moved it to the state level, such as Florida. Florida
state law says that a "negligent" or "reckless" discharge of a firearm
is a misdemeanor, which pre-empted city and county ordinances
surrounding firearms discharge.

So depending on where you live and the circumstances of your firearms
discharge, you either may face no charges, or you may face a misdemeanor
charge.
