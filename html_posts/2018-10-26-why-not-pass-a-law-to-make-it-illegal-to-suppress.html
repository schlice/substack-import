**Why not pass a law to make it illegal to suppress voting?**

During the period following emancipation, Southern states passed various
Jim Crowe laws designed to prevent newly freed blacks from voting,
things like poll taxes, literacy tests, and grandfather clauses. Most of
these things (and other forms of voter suppression) were made illegal by
the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which prohibits racial discrimination in
voting.

Specific voter laws are controlled at the state level, as voting is
conducted by state, and not by the Federal government. Many states
attempt to control what they claim is fraudulent voting practices
(especially by those who are not US citizens) by requiring some form of
ID to vote. Opponents of so-called voter ID laws claim that because some
people have difficulty obtaining government-issued ID, the laws are
intentionally designed to suppress those votes. Additionally, they
claim, there are so few actual cases of voter fraud that implementing
voter ID laws is a solution in search of a problem. Supporters claim
that you need government-issued ID to perform most functions in today's
society, including seeking assistance from the government, so providing
the same ID when voting shouldn't be an onerous requirement.

Therefore, states attempting to curb fraudulent voting by instituting
voter ID laws have faced stiff opposition in the courts, as people claim
that these laws are discriminatory and are actually intended to suppress
voters.
