**If federal agents are protected legally from following orders that are
illegal, are there any such protections for refusing to follow orders
that are immoral, unjust and possibly violate ethical codes of
conduct?**

No.

The reason is simple: **there is no standard for morality or ethics that
is universal amongst all people.**

My ethical and moral code is most likely different from yours. So there
is no basis upon which we can set a baseline for behavior. If everyone
is free to ignore orders based on their own moral code, then anyone can
claim that their own moral code prevents them from following orders, and
no one would follow orders, and no one could be prosecuted for failing
to follow orders.

Agents can refuse to follow *unlawful* orders. Agents cannot lawfully
refuse to follow *unethical* or *immoral* orders. They can certainly do
it and hope for the best in their disciplinary hearings, but there is no
rule that allows an agent to refuse to follow an order because they
personally find it immoral or unjust.

An "ethical code of conduct" sounds like department policy. If an agency
is issuing orders that violate its own internal policies, that should be
addressed separately.
