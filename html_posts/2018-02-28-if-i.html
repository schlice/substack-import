**If you're in the bathroom when a shooting occurs at a school, what
should you do?**

Stay there.

Hunker down, don't make any noise other than to call 911 on your cell
phone, and stay there. If there happens to be something in there you can
use to barricade the door, do it.

Oh, if the bathroom has a window (most school bathrooms don't have
windows these days), try to open it and get out if you happen to be on
the 1st floor. Otherwise, just stay there.
