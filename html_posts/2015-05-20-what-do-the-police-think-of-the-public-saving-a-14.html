**Content:** [I can appreciate the goal of the \"copwatch\" groups and
similar groups.\
\
But I think it\'s important to note that **this was the absolute WRONG
way to handle this situation.**\
\
Those of us who answer police-related questions on Quora have all said
the same thing over and over, and it is just as true in this case:\
\
*[There are many remedies available to you to deal with alleged police
abuse.]{.underline}* ***[NOT ONE]{.underline}*** *[of those remedies
takes place at the scene.]{.underline}*\
\
What would have happened if, instead of getting in his car and driving
away, the officer got in his car and called for backup? We would have
had a huge fight between officers and citizens, and lots of people would
have gotten hurt, and quite possibly one or more persons may have been
killed. The police would have been well within their rights to do so,
and also to arrest every single one of those folks on multiple charges,
some charges may have been impeding a police investigation, interfering
with law enforcement, resisting arrest, failure to follow lawful orders,
etc. *The protestors were clearly in the wrong.*\
\
It may have ended well from a social justice point of view, but while
our states are still protected by the police, then the police decide who
gets arrested, not the citizens. If the citizens feel the police made a
bad arrest, they should go down *en masse* to the police station and
protest the arrest. But interfering with a police officer while he is
performing his duties is a really bad idea and is very dangerous.\
\
*I can\'t stress this enough.* Don\'t ever do something as stupid as
this. And please don\'t comment and say silly things like, \"it worked,
didn\'t it?\" Yes, in a very Macchiavellian sort of way, it may have
worked this time. But next time, will the officer leave, or will they
call for backup? ***Please remember, pushing the button on a police call
box when there is no requirement for police assistance is a crime.***
Please don\'t lose that fact in the midst of the perceived \"David and
Goliath\" victory you may be celebrating.]{.rendered_qtext}
