**Is it legal to have to be nude and/or have sex in your backyard, hence
on your property, if others (the neighbors) could clearly see from their
two story house?**

*(US Answer Only)*

I've already answered the question about whether or not you can be nude
in your backyard.

[[Bill Stein\'s answer to Can one get arrested for being nude in one's
backyard?](https://www.quora.com/Can-one-get-arrested-for-being-nude-in-one-s-backyard/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container}

The question about having sex in your backyard is a little bit more
clear-cut, but still difficult to define for the United States. Each
state classifies it a little bit different, but to answer your specific
question, the fact that you have a neighbor who can see you from their
two-story house makes this a bit easier to say whether or not it's
legal.

In most cases, you would be committing what is known as **lewd acts**.
Again, each state is different, but in most cases, this covers all sex
acts committed in public. Clearly, the difference becomes what
constitutes "in public" and states are all over the map on this point.
In most cases, "visible by others" constitutes "in public." Check your
state and local laws to see how they define lewd acts.

You can also be charged with **indecent exposure.** Check my previous
answer about being nude in your own backyard with regards to the
differences between the states on indecent exposure.

These are not felonies. They are usually misdemeanors, which mean they
carry a fine, and possible jail time of up to a year, although in
practice it would be less than that.
