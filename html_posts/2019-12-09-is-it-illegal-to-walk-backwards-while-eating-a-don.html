**Is it illegal to walk backwards while eating a donut?**

While it's unclear exactly whether or not this law is ever enforced, it
is actually illegal in Marion, Ohio to walk backwards while eating a
donut.

I'm unable to find the context on this law. I'm sure it made sense to
someone in Marion, Ohio at the time it was written.

Clearly, it makes no sense now.
