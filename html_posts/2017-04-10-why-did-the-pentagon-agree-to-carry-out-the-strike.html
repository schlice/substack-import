1.  *Why did the Pentagon agree to carry out the strike on Syria, if the
    US Constitution requires the approval of Congress for such military
    action?\
    \*
    The Pentagon agreed to carry out the strike because they are not
    Congress, and they are not the Supreme Court. It's their job to be
    the military, not Congress or the courts. The Commander-in-Chief
    issued an order, and they followed it. They are exceptionally good
    at following orders.\
    \
    Also, the Constitution does not require Congressional approval
    before military action can be conducted. In fact, during Korea and
    Vietnam, Congress was worried that the President was operating
    essentially unchecked. They signed a joint Congressional Resolution,
    called the War Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1541--1548). It was
    intended to be a check on Presidential powers, and in fact was
    passed with 2/3 majority in Congress, overriding a presidential
    veto. It states that the President can only conduct military
    operations for 60 days without Congressional approval (either an
    Authorization for the Use of Military Force \[AUMF\], or a
    declaration of war), and that any military action must cease and any
    deployed troops must be withdrawn within 90 days if no approval has
    been granted. Since we are well within 60 days (the attack was over
    within a few hours), the President still has upwards of two months
    to conduct more operations before he must have approval from
    Congress.
2.  *\[M\]any world leaders approve the strike although it has still not
    been proved that the chemical attack were effected by the Syrian
    government. Why ?\*
    \
    Intelligence sources from around the world confirmed that the
    aircraft which bombed the city originated from the airfield in
    question. US intelligence released radar "traces" which actually
    showed the flight path the suspect aircraft took. Unless foreign
    governments are operating on Syrian military bases using Syrian
    military aircraft, it's extremely unlikely that this attack was
    *not* carried out by Syria. Additionally, the Al-Assad regime has
    not denied that they carried out the attack. They denounced the US
    response (as expected), but they did not deny the attack.
