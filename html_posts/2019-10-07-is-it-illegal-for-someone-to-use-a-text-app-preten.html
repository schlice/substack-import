**Is it illegal for someone to use a text app pretending to be you,
screenshooting the conversation and sending to others as "proof" that
you're a bad person?**

No, that is not a crime for which someone could go to jail. At worst, it
would be a "parody" account, in which one person pretends to be a parody
of someone else. Depending on the platform, parody accounts may not be
allowed, and it might violate the terms of service on the platform,
causing the perpetrator to get booted from that service.

What you *might* be able to sue for (not have someone arrested for) is
**libel**. If you can show that the "proof that you're a bad person"
resulted in direct harm (i.e. you lost your job over the untrue
statements), then you can sue for libel. You can then tack on pain and
suffering, and possibly punitive damages.

Now, if the person was sending messages over SMS, this may be a bigger
deal. There are Federal laws which protect SMS conversations, so if
someone was able to send messages as you, there may be some charges
which could be pressed. But just taking screenshots of text on a screen
"pretending" to be someone else, while pretty cruel, is not a crime.
