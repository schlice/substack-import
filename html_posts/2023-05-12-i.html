First off, good for you being able to stay on Tysabri for 8 years! I
lasted 18 months on Tysabri before I had to move off. Tysabri has better
efficacy than any other MS med out there.

That said, there are plenty of other medications, and which one is right
for you is dependent on lots of factors. And I know this is going to
sound dismissive, but you really need to work with your neurologist on
this. Your neurologist can help you choose a different medicine with a
different mode of administration (injectable or pill) that has decent
efficiacy and manageable side effects.

If it were me (and it was), I'd look to pills at this point. For me, I
moved to Gilenya from Tysabri, and just a few years ago, my neurologist
moved me to Zeposia (which works nearly the same as Gilenya, but is
safer). But I started out on injectables (Copaxone) before I went to
Tysabri.

Good luck.
