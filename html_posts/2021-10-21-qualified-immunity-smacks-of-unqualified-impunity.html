Ooo, a theory question! And it's about qualified immunity, too. I feel
like a kid in a candy store!

So, let's break it down to the real question you're asking: **why do we
need qualified immunity? Why can't we just let the court decide if
monetary damages should be due?**

The TL;DR version of that answer is that some form of qualified immunity
is right and necessary when a public servant truly believes he or she is
acting in good faith. If they believe they are following a judge's order
or existing law, **even if they turn out to be wrong**, they should not
be held fiscally responsible for any damages.

However, I will agree that in some cases, the current qualified immunity
doctrine makes it difficult to allow a case to go forward when the
standard includes the fact that the only way the case can go forward is
if other appellate courts have found that similar conduct has been ruled
illegal. In some cases, this relatively high bar for allowing a case to
proceed means that some cases in which there may actually be negligence
on the part of the public servant may not be allowed to proceed simply
because no cases involving similar conduct have already found that
conduct to be illegal. In effect, this means that if you're the first
offender, you might get off without having to face civil suit.

There is room for improvement in the qualified immunity doctrine. I
believe that some level of qualified immunity should still exist, but in
some cases (like police brutality), it probably should not, and we
should allow the courts to proceed with their investigations. We will
probably need a combination of thoughtful legislation as well as some
court procedure reform to make this better.
