When I was training to become a Reserve Deputy, the story was told of a
Deputy who used to be British Special Forces. He had a rig on the back
of his duty belt which held *four* fully loaded magazines for his
sidearm, in addition to the two-mag pouch he wore on the front of his
belt.

The other guys used to tease him. "Hey Rambo, think you have enough ammo
there?" they'd say.

He would simply respond, "Have you ever been in a firefight and run out
of ammo? Once you feel what that feels like, you'll never ever want to
feel that again."
