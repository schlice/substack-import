**Content:** [Yes, TDoS can be considered a crime under a US law called
the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (18 USC ยง 1030).\
\
This specific issue (overloading a telephone system causing denial of
service) was raised in the 6th Circuit in 2011 in the case [[*Pulte
Homes, Inc. v. Laborers' International Union of North
America*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c969ed&url=http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/11a0200p-06.pdf){.external_link

But, you say, CFAA is targeted at \"computer systems,\" and was
originally written to combat DDoS attacks against websites. Making it
qualify against phone systems is a stretch, right? Well, as you probably
already know, circuit courts are very flexible, and they do make the
stretch:\
\

> Under the CFAA, "any impairment to the integrity or availability of
> data, a program, a system, or information" qualifies as "damage."
> Because the statute includes no definition of three key
> terms--"impairment," "integrity," and "availability"--we look to the
> ordinary meaning of these words. "Impairment" means a "deterioration"
> or an "injurious lessening or weakening." The definition of
> "integrity" includes an "uncorrupted condition," an "original perfect
> state," and "soundness." And "availability" is the "capability of
> being employed or made use of." **Applying these ordinary usages, we
> conclude that a transmission that weakens a sound computer system--or,
> similarly, one that diminishes a Plaintiff's ability to use data or a
> system--causes damage.**"

\
They don\'t call it a phone system, they call it a \"sound computer
system.\" So once you re-classify a telephony system as a \"sound
computer system,\" it qualifies under CFAA.\
\
Therefore, under Federal law, TDoS is a crime under CFAA.
