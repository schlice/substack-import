Not sure which "gospel-good news message of Christ Jesus found in God's
Word" you're looking at, but the Bible is replete with admonitions to
repent.

Every time Jesus healed someone, He said "Go, and sin no more." *Sin no
more* is a command to turn from sin.

The Bible is filled with admonitions to repent. Here's just a few
examples:

- Acts 3:19 - Repent therefore, and turn back, that your sins may be
  blotted out
- Matthew 4:17 - From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent,
  for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
- 2 Peter 3:9 - The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some
  count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should
  perish, but that all should reach repentance.
- Acts 2:38 - And Peter said to them, "Repent and be baptized every one
  of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins,
  and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
- 2 Chronicles 7:14 - If my people who are called by my name humble
  themselves, and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways,
  then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and heal their
  land.
- Matthew 3:8 - Bear fruit in keeping with repentance.
- Acts 17:30 - The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he
  commands all people everywhere to repent
- Luke 13:3 - No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all
  likewise perish.
- 1 John 1:9 - If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to
  forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
- Proverbs 28:13 - Whoever conceals his transgressions will not prosper,
  but he who confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy.
