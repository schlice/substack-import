No.

It indicates that America is a place that a lot of people want to go to.
But the statement "America is a great country" is an opinion. The fact
that lots of people want to come here does tend to support the truth of
that opinion, but it is not a direct 1:1 correlation. It's still just an
opinion.

Granted, I happen to hold that opinion as well, but the simple fact that
lots of people want to come here is not proof that America is great.
