Stopping you and asking for your ID are two separate things.

The stop is covered in the United States by the Supreme Court decision
in *Terry v. Ohio*. The police have the ability to perform brief
investigatory stops, sometimes called *stop-and-frisk* or *Terry stops*.
The police have to be able to articulate a valid reason for stopping you
using specific facts, which constitutes what we now call *reasonable
suspicion*. The officer has the right to continue the line of reasonable
suspicion and *frisk* the suspect, which is different from a *search*
incident to an arrest, or a search with a warrant. The frisk is in the
outermost clothing only, and is only for the officer's safety (i.e.
searching for weapons).

Asking for your name and/or valid ID is more related to [[stop-and-ID
laws](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=af08f0&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_and_identify_statutes){.external_link

These laws have been found to be Constitutional, but not all states have
them. For example, in Colorado, the stop-and-ID law reads:

> \(1\) A peace officer may stop any person who he reasonably suspects
> is committing, has committed, or is about to commit a crime and may
> require him to give his name and address, identification if available,
> and an explanation of his actions. A peace officer shall not require
> any person who is stopped pursuant to this section to produce or
> divulge such person\'s social security number. The stopping shall not
> constitute an arrest.
>
> \(2\) When a peace officer has stopped a person for questioning
> pursuant to this section and reasonably suspects that his personal
> safety requires it, he may conduct a pat-down search of that person
> for weapons.[\[1\]](#TjLtH){#cite-TjLtH .citation_link}
>
> C.R.S. 16--3--103(1--2)

So the Colorado statute takes the *reasonable suspicion* standard
developed in *Terry* and extends it to a state-level requirement to
provide name, address, ID (if you have it), and an explanation of your
actions. Note that SSN is not part of your personally identifying
information. Also of note is that paragraph 2 expands and clarifies
*Terry* to include pat-down searches looking specifically for weapons.

While *Terry* is a SCOTUS ruling, not all states have mandatory ID laws
during *Terry* stops.

Now, **if you are arrested**, you are *required* to give your personally
identifying information, and you may not lie about that. If you're just
stopped on the street, whether or not you are required by law to give
your name varies by state.
