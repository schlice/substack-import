**What reasons do Christians have to believe that Jesus is both fully
human and fully divine?**

The answer about anything that a Christian believes should always be
"The Bible" or it's not the right answer.

So, to add a finer point to the question:

**What reasons \[as recorded in the Bible\] do Christians have to
believe that Jesus is both fully human and fully divine?**

The Bible teaches that Jesus' divine nature was united with his physical
nature

The Bible also teaches that the two natures are united in only one
divine person:

Some argue that the hypostatic union is a creation of man, or instituted
to resolve the differences between the camps that thought Jesus was
either fully human or fully divine, or something in between (like when
you mix red and orange you get yellow). While the actual hypostatic
union is documented well in the Bible, the most theologically and
historically sound definition, however, was created at the Council of
Chalcedon in 451 AD. It is also where the term "hypostatic union" was
coined.

> Therefore, following the holy fathers, we all with one accord teach

> once complete in Godhead and complete in manhood, truly God and truly
> man, consisting also of a reasonable soul and body; of one substance
> with the Father as regards his Godhead, and at the same time of one
> substance with us as regards his manhood; like us in all respects,
> apart from sin; as regards his Godhead, begotten of the Father before
> the ages, but yet as regards his manhood begotten, for us men and for
> our salvation, of Mary the Virgin, the God-bearer; one and the same
> Christ, Son, Lord, Only-begotten, recognized in two natures, without
> confusion, without change, without division, without separation; the
> distinction of natures being in no way annulled by the union, but
> rather the characteristics of each nature being preserved and coming

> separated into two persons, but one and the same Son and Only-begotten
> God the Word, Lord Jesus Christ; even as the prophets from earliest

> the creed of the fathers has handed down to
> us.[\[2\]](#zrAZs){#cite-zrAZs .citation_link}

In short, Christ was both fully human and fully divine at the same time.
The human did not constrain the divine, and the divine did not alter the
human.
