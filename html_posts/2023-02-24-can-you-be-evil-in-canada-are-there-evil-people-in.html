Nope. It's 100% against the law to be evil in Canada. There are no evil
people in Canada. They all moved to the United States decades ago.

Canada is a utopia of butterflies and rainbows where the unicorns poop
sunshine and it's never a sad day.

\* For clarity, I love Canada, but there are evil people *everywhere.*
Canada is no exception. Because evil people are everywhere, and Canada
is a place where people can be, therefore evil people can be in Canada.

Logic.

Boom.
