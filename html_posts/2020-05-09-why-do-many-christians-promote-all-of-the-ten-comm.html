**Why do many Christians promote all of the Ten Commandments except the
4th?**

So the 4th Commandment is to "keep holy the Sabbath day."

*But what exactly does that mean?*

In the Bible, a synagogue leader tried to trip Jesus up for supposedly
violating the Sabbath because he healed a woman on the Sabbath. The
exchange went like this:

> On a Sabbath Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues, and a woman
> was there who had been crippled by a spirit for eighteen years. She
> was bent over and could not straighten up at all. When Jesus saw her,
> he called her forward and said to her, "Woman, you are set free from
> your infirmity." Then he put his hands on her, and immediately she
> straightened up and praised God.
>
> Indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, the synagogue
> leader said to the people, "There are six days for work. So come and
> be healed on those days, not on the Sabbath."
>
> The Lord answered him, "You hypocrites! Doesn't each of you on the
> Sabbath untie your ox or donkey from the stall and lead it out to give
> it water? Then should not this woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom
> Satan has kept bound for eighteen long years, be set free on the
> Sabbath day from what bound her?"
>
> ---Luke 13:10--16 NIV

The Sabbath day is to be kept because when God created the world, he
rested on the Sabbath. We too are commanded to rest. Take a break from
our work, and exist in the peace of Christ.

What specifically that looks like is different for everyone, and the
Bible does not prescribe a formula for "resting."

Jesus, in Luke's passage, was teaching on the Sabbath, and that was his
life's work. So was he keeping holy the Sabbath? Since worship and rest
look different for everyone, he probably was.
