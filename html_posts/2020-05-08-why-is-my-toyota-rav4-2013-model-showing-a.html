**Why is my Toyota RAV4 2013 model showing a "Trac Off" and "Engine
Check" sign? Is this something serious?**

Probably not, but you should probably get the code checked to find out.

When you get one of those "Check Engine" lights, it's because one of the
car's diagnostic systems has found a fault. It has deposited a fault
code in a special buffer designed for such an occurrence. When a code is
present in that buffer, the "Check Engine" light illuminates.

Most auto parts stores in the United States, such as Advanced Auto
Parts, or O'Reilly's Auto Parts, will check the code for free. I'm
certain that nearly every other large auto repair shop will also check
the code (for free) while simultaneously offering to fix the issue for
you (not for free).

In your case, it's most likely the case that you have a fault in your
vehicle's traction control system, considering that both lights came on
at the same time.

You should have this serviced.
