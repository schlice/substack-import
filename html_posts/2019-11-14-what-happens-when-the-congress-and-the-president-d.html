**What happens when the Congress and the president do not like a Supreme
Court ruling that interprets the meaning of the Constitution?**

There are really only three things to do: nothing, re-write the law, or
re-write the Constitution.

1.  **Nothing.** They can understand that the Supreme Court isn't the
    last word because they're always right; the Supreme Court is always
    right because it has the last word.
2.  **Re-write the law.** They can write a new law which accomplishes
    what they wanted to accomplish while staying Constitutional. Perhaps
    they can remove the unconstitutional portion of the law. Perhaps
    they can re-word the law to respect the Constitution.
3.  **Re-write the Constitution.** They can pass an Amendment to the
    Constitution and submit it to the States for ratification. If the
    Amendment is ratified, then they can re-pass the original
    legislation which is no longer conflicting with the amended
    Constitution. Admittedly, this would be the most difficult path.
