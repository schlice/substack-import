**How was Trump able to appoint so many Federal judges?**

Answer: Democrats.

In 2013, then Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid used "the nuclear
option" to eliminate the 60-vote rule for most Executive nominations,
which required that the number of votes needed to stop a filibuster of
Presidential nominees and Federal court judges (not Supreme Court
justices) be 60. With that rule gone, nominees for cabinet-level and
executive branch positions and Federal court judges need only a 51-vote
simple majority to move for cloture (i.e. stop the filibuster). Reid and
the Democrats were warned that once that genie is out of the bottle, it
will work both ways if there is a swing in power in the Senate.

And then the 2016 elections happened, and the Senate was once again in
the control of Republicans.

In April 2017, Senate Republicans added SCOTUS justices to the list of
Executive nominees which no longer needed 60 votes to end a filibuster.
This allowed the nomination of Neal Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.

And with the minority party unable to slow down Presidential nominees to
Federal court vacancies, Trump and the Republicans in the Senate have
been pumping out those nominations and Senate confirmations. Trump has
appointed four times as many Federal appeals judges in his first year as
Obama did.
