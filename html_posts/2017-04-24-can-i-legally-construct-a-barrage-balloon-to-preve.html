If your intent is to shoot down a drone, or cause it to crash, then what
you're doing would be illegal. You do not have the right to cause a
drone to crash simply because you don't want it to fly above your house.

If, however, your goal is to simply ensure your privacy on your
property, I would suggest you go about it a different way. If you
instead erected towers at each corner of your property and stretched
camouflage netting across it, preventing drone operators from flying
below it or looking through it, you might get away with it. I imagine
you'd be running afoul of some local ordinance about construction of
posts above a certain height, unless the posts were no higher than the
maximum height of your house.
