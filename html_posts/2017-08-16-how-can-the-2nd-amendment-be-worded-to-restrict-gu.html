To answer your very specific question:

> *How can the 2nd Amendment be worded to the restrict gun ownership to
> actual members of a well-regulated militia like the National Guard?*

You can't re-word an amendment. You must **repeal** and **replace** the
amendment, since in its current wording, it applies to "the people,"
which has been interpreted by the Supreme Court to mean all citizens.
Never mind the whole "natural rights" thing and that the Bill of Rights
doesn't actually grant rights so it can't take them away; that
discussion is clearly above some, so we'll stick with the question as it
was asked. Specifically, you can't just "re-word" an amendment, you have
to repeal it and replace it with a new amendment.

And if you thought repealing and replacing Obamacare was difficult,
repealing and replacing the Second Amendment will be **infinitely**
harder. By the way, the rules for drafting and ratifying new amendments
are in Article V of the Constitution.

First, you need to *draft* an amendment. Sounds easy, right? But it's
not as simple as you or I writing words on a form and shoving it in a
mailbox. There are only two ways that a new amendment can be drafted:

1.  Congress (by a 2/3 vote in both houses) can draft a new amendment.
2.  An "Article V Convention," also called an "Amendments Convention,"
    can be called by 2/3 of the states, to propose and draft a new
    amendment.

Once the amendment has been drafted, the second step is to send it to
the states to be *ratified.* ***3/4ths*** of the states need to ratify
the amendment. Once you have the requisite number of states that ratify
the Amendment, it becomes part of the Constitution.

This means you have to get 3/4ths of the states to agree with you that
only the National Guard should have guns. Once you do that, maybe you
can repeal and replace the 2nd Amendment.
