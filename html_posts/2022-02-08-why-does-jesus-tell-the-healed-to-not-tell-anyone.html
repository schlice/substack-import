Jesus didn't want news of his miracles to distract people from his
message or disrupt his mission. However, like was recorded in Mark
1:41--42, when he healed the man of leprosy and told that man to keep
quiet, the man did not obey. Subsequently, Jesus had to move his
ministry outside of the city, and into the desert areas.

Ultimately, Jesus didn't want people to focus on the healing. He wanted
them to focus on the message.
