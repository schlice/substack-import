The answer is because Democrats *still* think abortion is a winning
issue.

They think they have the upper hand on abortion. They think that simply
saying, "I want to codify *Roe* into federal law" will induce a massive
blue wave, because they've been told that a majority of people supported
*Roe*.

Well, as usual, the pollsters got it wrong.

A majority of Americans supported not messing around with *Roe*. But
that same majority of Americans support ***some*** restrictions on
abortion, **because that's actually what** ***Roe*** **said**. It was
the *other case law, Planned Parenthood v. Casey,* which allowed
abortion for all nine months.

Yes, most Americans did support *Roe*, but not *Casey.* More Americans
support an abortion ban after 15 weeks than those who do
not.[\[1\]](#qSxuW){#cite-qSxuW .citation_link} And support for
abortions *beyond* 15 weeks drops *sharply*, to the point that the
**vast** majority of Americans do not support abortions in the third
trimester.[\[2\]](#WfHYc){#cite-WfHYc .citation_link}

The "codifying *Roe* into law" that Democrats support is **full
legalization of abortion for all nine months of pregnancy**. Literally,
under a Democrat *Roe-*like law, the mother could be in active labor and
decide to abort her baby, and it would be legal. Again, the vast
majority of Americans do not support this; the numbers are sharply
against this.

Republicans decided (a bit late, but decided anyway) to *lean in* to
this fact, and it has propelled them to victory in several key races
already. When faced with their *radical* stance on abortion, the Dems
have nowhere to fall back to. The economy under Biden is a shambles, and
it's mostly due to his energy policies, and consequently, prices are
going up, and jobs are going down. \$2/gallon gas looks pretty good
right about now. The border is wide open; anyone can come in and stay.
Our politicians are sending billions and billions of our tax dollars
overseas to countries to fight wars that have no effect on us. People
are concerned about the economy first, and abortion second. Abortion
will not overcome a poor economy.

But Democrats think it will.

I suppose we shall see.
