> If the police don\'t have a warrant, can they come into your home?

Yes. You can invite them, or they can force their way in. Only one of
those is legal. I'll let you guess which one.

> What can you do if they try to enter your home without a warrant?

Nothing. You let them come in, all the while telling them that you did
not grant them permission to come in. Nothing they find will be
admissible in court because they did not have permission to enter the
home in the first place.
