It would be nearly impossible to calculate.

For starters, many push ups take place at odd times and odd locations.
Basically, any time you are standing around waiting for something else
to happen, you will find yourself in the front leaning rest position.
Since those times are many and varied (you also become fully qualified
in "hurry up and wait,") calculating the number of push ups done would
be next to impossible.

Running is worse, since some people actually *enjoy* running. They
actually do it on their own! In truth, I used to be one of these truly
insane people.

I hesitate to even hazard a guess, mostly because I think it may scare
me.
