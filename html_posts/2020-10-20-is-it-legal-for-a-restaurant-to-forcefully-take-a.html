**Is it legal for a restaurant to forcefully take a non-reserved table
from a patron after the patron has sat down and placed an order? What
are the legal options of the patron?**

Today in Law 101 we're discussing *implied-in-fact contracts*. These are
contracts which are created by circumstances, not documents.

In this case, a contract is implied in fact because both parties assumed
that an agreement existed, and their behavior implied that they were
keeping to that agreement. When the restaurant seated the patron and
took their order, the restaurant was entering into an implied-in-fact
contract which stated that they would cook and serve the ordered food,
and the patron in turn would pay the restaurant for the food and the
service. The contract didn't need to be written and signed, because both
parties acted as if the contract existed.

It follows then that if an implied-in-fact contract existed, one of the
parties can be sued for breach of that contract.

In this case, however, it would not only be difficult to prove that an
implied-in-fact contract existed, what would be the damages? Would you
seek compensatory damages? Would you seek punitive damages? You can
absolutely sue the restaurant and take them to small-claims court
without any attorney needed, but the restaurant will likely present a
reason they moved you from the table, and you will have a difficult time
proving them wrong.

While you have a case, you don't have a good chance of prevailing, or
gaining anything substantial other than the cost of your meal. Leave a
bad review on Yelp and move on.
