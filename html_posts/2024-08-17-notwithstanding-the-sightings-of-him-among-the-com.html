Well, if you ignore the sightings (of which there were over 100), you're
ignoring a critical piece of evidence. Remember, these people who saw
Jesus after He was raised were *persecuted*, *beaten* and *killed*
because of their belief. Yet they maintained their stories all the way
through their deaths, when all they had to do to spare themselves the
torture and execution would be to recant the story. That's pretty
powerful testimony you're ignoring.

But let's set the sightings aside for a moment. Let's focus on the tomb,
and the question: *could Jesus' body have been stolen?*

The answer is that anything is possible, ***but it is extremely
unlikely.***

The reasons:

1.  The stone itself
2.  The seal
3.  The guards

First, let's look at the tomb and **the stone** that was covering its
entrance. If you've ever seen a *millstone*, then you know the type of
stone that was covering the entrance to the tomb. It was a large, round
stone which sat in a channel in an incline cut in the limestone of the
hillside where the tomb was hewn. It took several men to roll the stone
back up the incline, which was specifically designed to thwart both
grave robbers and wild animals.

Once the stone was in place, the Romans *sealed* the tomb. The seal was
probably made of soft, moldable clay, imprinted the seal of the Roman
Procurator. The seal on the stone held a rope which was attached to the
cliff wall. Anyone disturbing the seal was subject to immediate
execution, and everyone knew it.

Because Jesus died on the weekend of the Passover, there were to be
thousands of people in Jerusalem, and both the Romans and the Pharisees
knew that there would be many followers of Jesus who might want to steal
the body. So they sent **several squads of troops** (each squad has four
Roman soldiers) to guard the entrance to the tomb. Additionally, the
Pharisees sent Temple Guards themselves. There were at least 16 highly
trained guards at the entrance to the tomb. These guards were accustomed
to late night guard duty, and had much experience keeping each other
accountable and awake, knowing that falling asleep on duty was grounds
for, yep you guessed it, execution.

So it's highly unlikely that a group of people who were already targets
of Rome and were in hiding would sneak out and try to catch *all the
guards, asleep,* and *move the stone* ***silently*** so as *not to wake
them.*

Is it *possible*? Sure, it's possible. Anything is possible.

But is it *likely*? No, it is not.

What is most likely is the account in the Bible. An angel effortlessly
rolled the stone away. The guards were in complete shock at what they
saw. They were frozen with fear (the Bible says "they were like dead
men"). They only had a few options, and none of them were good. They
could claim that robbers took the body, at which point they would be
executed. They could claim that they allowed someone to take the body,
wherein they would also be executed. So instead, they ran immediately to
the Pharisees and told them everything. The Pharisees paid them a large
sum of money to never tell that story again to anyone, and to claim that
robbers stole the body while they were asleep. The Bible stories don't
tell us whether or not the guards were punished for what happened, but
we know that several of the Pharisees were converted to belief in Christ
upon hearing the testimony of the guards.

So here's what it would have looked like if the disciples stole Jesus'
body.

Yeah, the whole notion is pretty ridiculous, wouldn't you think?
