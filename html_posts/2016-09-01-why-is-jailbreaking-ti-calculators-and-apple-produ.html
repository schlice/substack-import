Basically, jailbreaking TI calculators (presumably to load programs in
non-volatile memory) and Apple products is hard because TI and Apple
don't want you doing it. If they wanted you to be able to do it, it
would be easy. Like installing an app easy. It's difficult because they
don't want you to do it.

There are several reasons they don't want you to do it.

- Reputation. TI calculators are known for the ability to be able to
  clear the running memory of any user-installed programs with a key
  combination (2nd-Clear IIRC). The screen then displays "MEMORY
  CLEARED". This is the instructor's indication that the user-accessible
  portion of the memory has been cleared and you have no applications
  installed on the calculator that would give you an "unfair advantage"
  such as storage of formulas you're supposed to memorize. Jailbreaking
  the calculator may allow you to install applications in the
  *non-volatile* portion of the memory, such that you can clear the user
  portion and the application will remain, or you can generate a fake
  "MEMORY CLEARED" message, or change the function of the Clear button.
  If jailbreaking a TI calculator was easy, classrooms would not require
  their use since it was so easy to bypass security and gain unfair
  advantage.
- User Experience. Apple, on the other hand, is trying to create the
  most user-friendly product it can. Ensuring that your experience is
  best-in-class means ensuring you cannot make changes that would
  negatively affect that experience. Remember that Apple is primarily a
  hardware company. They also make software that will operate their
  hardware, and only their hardware, no one else's. One of the things
  that makes Apple products so appealing is that their stuff "just
  works." There are no hardware compatibility issues to deal with, no
  operating system limitations that don't allow you to fully utilize
  your hardware, and no hardware functions that can't be properly or
  fully utilized due to incompatibility with the software. Note that
  this is in stark contrast to Android, which runs on a wide variety of
  hardware.
- Security. Jailbreaking your devices and making changes to them may
  introduce security vulnerabilities. This may not be a big deal to you,
  but if you store your bank's information or a credit card on your
  phone, security vulnerabilities are a big deal to them. Oftentimes,
  it's for this reason that electronic pay software (like Apple Pay,
  Samsung Pay or Google Wallet) will not run on jailbroken (or rooted)
  devices. The devices will report to the software whether or not they
  are jailbroken (or rooted) and the software will decide on its own
  whether or not it can be used.
