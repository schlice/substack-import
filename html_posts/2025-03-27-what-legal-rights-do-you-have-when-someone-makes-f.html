As with all legal answers, the answer is "it depends."

Any time someone makes a false statement about you, it is called
***defamation***. Spoken defamation is called "slander" while written
defamation is called "libel." Any type of defamatory statement is
actionable, including claims about your mental health. And in all cases,
the truth is an affirmative defense against a defamation action.

There are three required elements of defamation:

- A spoken or written statement about you which expresses a false
  statement of fact
- Publication or transmission of that statement to a third party, and
- Harm to your reputation caused by the statement.

In the US, a plaintiff can recover compensatory damages for defamation
when they show "actual injury" without regard for "actual malice." In
other words, the person who defamed you didn't need to do so with intent
to cause actual injury before you can recover damages.

There are also 33 states which have a "retraction statute." These
statutes generally require a plaintiff to ask a media outlet to retract
the allegedly defamatory statement as a condition to claiming damages,
and sometimes even before the plaintiff may pursue litigation at all. A
timely retraction by the defendant usually will limit a plaintiff's
recoverable damages.
