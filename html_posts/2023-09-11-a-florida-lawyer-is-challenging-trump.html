There are some really big Constitutional questions to answer, namely
whether or not Amendment 14 Section 3 applies to Presidents, what counts
as "engaging in an insurrection," who has standing to challenge Trump's
eligibility, and who has the authority to enforce his disqualification
if he is disqualified.

Section 3 has been a dead letter since 1871. We want to move cautiously
with now applying Section 3, because we want to be sure that Section 3
doesn't become yet another means by which partisan adversaries can go
after and sideline their political opponents. We have enough of that
crap with our own Federal agencies, we don't need more of it now.

**Does it even apply to presidents?**

Is the office of the presidency even covered by Section 3? It isn't
mentioned in the text, and scholars disagree over whether the Framers,
or the average person in 1868, would view it as being covered. Some
scholars suggest the broader "office \... under the United States"
language shouldn't be read to include the presidency. Others say there's
no way Congress or the public in 1868 would have understood that, for
example, Jefferson Davis could not be a Representative or a Senator but
could be President.

**What counts as an "insurrection?"**

There is similar confusion around the meaning of the phrases "engaged in
insurrection or rebellion" and "given aid or comfort." While the DOJ has
charged more than 1100 Jan. 6 defendants (including, last month, Mr.
Trump), *none of them have been charged with insurrection* (more than a
dozen defendants have been convicted or pleaded guilty to seditious
conspiracy and sentenced to prison). Since insurrection involves more
than one person, it would be a tough row to hoe if all of the people you
claim are co-conspirators in your insurrection are never charged with
that crime.

While Section 3 still technically has legal force, some scholars say its
use in the 1860s and '70s has limited precedential value for today's
controversies. Most of those cases involved men who had been Confederate
officials just a few years earlier. Michael McConnell, a professor at
Stanford Law School, posits: "It was the Civil War, so no one needed to
debate the finer points of what an insurrection was." Given that, I
highly doubt that the Framers envisioned First Amendment-protected
political speech urging listeners to peacefully protest to request
redress of grievances as insurrection.

**Who gets to decide?**

Unlike impeachment (which has a detailed process outlined in the
Constitution), 14th Amendment disqualifications are procedurally vague.
How does the process work, and who performs that function? Is it the
Courts, Congress, or perhaps State and local officials that get to
decide who's qualified and who isn't?

If we read up on the Civil War era notes of those who wrote the
amendment, it seems that the thinking was largely focused on Congress as
the deciding authority. If a high-level government candidate required
Congressional approval, the reasoning follows that disqualification
under the 14th Amendment was also likely thought to involve a vote in
Congress. That's an entirely different process than a state limiting a
candidate's access to the ballot box. The Framers at least trusted the
will of the people to properly adjudicate whether or not a true
insurrectionist would ever be voted in as president. The more important
question, says Professor McConnell, "is whether the people should be
deprived of being able to vote for the candidate of their choice when it
appears."
