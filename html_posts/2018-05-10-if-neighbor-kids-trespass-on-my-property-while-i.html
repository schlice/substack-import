You've heard already about "attractive nuisance" statutes which require
that you take reasonable steps to secure your nuisance, be it a swimming
pool or a trampoline.

It's important to note that you can successfully defend against a
liability lawsuit if you have actually taken those reasonable steps to
secure your trampoline. If you erected the appropriate 6-foot privacy
fence around your yard, and you installed appropriate warning signs,
whatever is required by your locality, and they were all in good repair,
you stand a good chance of being able to prevail in such a suit.

The court will look at what a reasonable person would do in order to
secure a yard with a trampoline, as well as local ordinances for
securing "attractive nuisances," and your liability will be reduced
based on how far you went to do so.
