**Content:** [Your mention of diabetes mimicking alcohol totally brought
me back to my Air Force Security Police days. I stopped a guy who
blasted full speed through the main gate at NORAD when I was working as
the SRT Team Leader that day. When we finally got him stopped (just
outside the vehicle capture which leads into the facility itself), he
was groggy and partially unresponsive, and his breath smelled of
alcohol. I asked for his license and he gave me his library card.\
\
Somehow, he managed to show us his Medic Alert bracelet which showed he
was a diabetic. Hypoglycemia. We called Medical out, they checked him
out, gave him a candy bar, and within about 10 minutes we were able to
recount to him what he had done and how close we came to shooting him.
Turns out he had a diabetic incident down on the highway, felt it coming
on, and wasn\'t able to reach his emergency glucose pills before losing
control. It\'s amazing that he made it as far up NORAD Road as he did
without crashing, and that he made it through the gate, also without
crashing.]{.rendered_qtext}
