**Should this kind of information not be spread, as it may be disclosing
police tactics against criminals?**

In fact, quite the opposite. From your article:

As you can see, the police *want* this information out there. They would
much rather have the attacks stop than have to arrest people, but both
will accomplish the same goal: keeping riders on the Google Bus safe.
