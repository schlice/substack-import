**Should you be able to sue a cheating partner for breach of marriage
contract?**

If you signed a marriage contract, then sure, feel free to sue for
breach of contract.

But the "marriage contract" isn't a real contract. You do realize that,
right? Unless you have a contract that you signed and notarized, it's
not really a contract in the legal sense.

Marriage is two things. Primarily (and originally), it was a union
ordained by the church. The state co-opted the religious form of
marriage for a specific reason: *sex between men and women routinely
produces children.*

*Why would the state care about that?*

The state cares because the state has a compelling interest in the
welfare of children. To that end, the state encourages men and women to
structure their lives in the way which provides children the *best*
chance for success. Now before all the single mothers pounce, I said the
*best* chance for success, not the *only* chance for success. There are
excellent single parents out there who have done an absolutely Herculean
job raising their children. Some of them are my friends and I have
enjoyed watching them do what they do. They are simply amazing to me.
Despite their excellent examples, the best research we have today tells
us that children have the best chance for success when they are raised
by their biological parents in a common household.

Therefore, the state provides incentives when people structure their
lives in a way that would best support children (whether they have them
or not). This is why the state recognizes marriage.

Ever since the state made it no longer illegal to cheat on your spouse,
the whole theory of a "marriage contract" kinda disappeared. Because our
nation is moving away from religion anyway, marriage became this
state-sponsored tax break program which is entered into, and remains in
place, at the agreement of the partners.

Therefore, there is no "contract" in marriage any longer. It is an
arrangement of convenience. You can leave the arrangement at any time.
Just hire an attorney and you can dissolve your marriage.
