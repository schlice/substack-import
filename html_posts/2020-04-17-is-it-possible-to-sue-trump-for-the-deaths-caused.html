**Is it possible to sue Trump for the deaths caused by his delayed
actions regarding Coronavirus?**

In the United States, you can sue anyone for anything. The question now
comes down to whether or not you have a snowball's chance in The Hot
Place of prevailing.

And the answer to that question is **it's pretty unlikely**.

You would likely sue for something along the lines of wrongful death or
something similar. However, in order to prove wrongful death, **you have
to show that Trump wrongfully caused someone's death** by intentionally
delaying actions regarding Coronavirus. You would have to show that his
delays actually caused death, and that the death was *proximate* to the
delay (in other words, if it couldn't have been likely that he could
have imagined that his actions would directly have resulted in the
death, then it's probably too far down the causal chain in order to be
actionable).
