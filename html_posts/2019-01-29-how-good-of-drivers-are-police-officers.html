**How good of drivers are police officers?**

Selection of police officers requires an *impeccable* driving record. If
you've had excessive speeding tickets, or excessive traffic accidents,
you won't be selected to attend the police academy.

Police officers receive some advanced driving training. In our state,
officers receive 40 hours of driving training in their police academies,
and it does cover emergency vehicle operations. This is 40 more hours of
training than civilians have received, so in theory, they should be
slightly better drivers.

Also, their cars are their offices, so they spend 8 hours a day or more
in their cars. With that much additional experience, they should be
pretty good.

However, beyond a little extra training and (potentially) more time
behind the wheel, they are no different than anyone else with regard to
how well they drive. Some officers are really good drivers, and others,
despite the training and experience, still are really bad.
