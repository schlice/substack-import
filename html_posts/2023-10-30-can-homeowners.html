The answer, as with all legal answers, is "it depends."

And what it depends on are the rules you have in your Governing
Documents.

If your HOA can dictate what kind of car you are allowed to have on the
property, if you have a disallowed car on the property, you can be
fined, even if it is not directly visible from the street. For example,
many of my corner lot neighbors have fully fenced-in back yards, and
gates wide enough to fit a car which can be entered from the side
street. If you were to park a prohibited car there (not visible, not in
violation of city ordinance) the HOA can still fine you.

The Governing Documents are essentially a contract between you and the
HOA. Violations of that contract are still punishable by the punishments
available to the HOA, which usually consist of fines.
