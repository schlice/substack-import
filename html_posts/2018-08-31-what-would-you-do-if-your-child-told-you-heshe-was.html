**What would you do if your child told you he/she was going to buy a gun
or other weapon?**

First of all, *children* can't buy weapons. So if a "child" told me
he/she was going to buy a weapon, I'd do everything in my power to
prevent it, or if it happened, to bring the "salesperson" to justice for
illegal firearms sales.

My *children* (biologically) bought their own firearms. My son bought a
beautiful Savage .30--06 hunting rifle when he turned 18. My oldest son
bought a different, but no less beautiful, Springfield XD .45 pistol
when he turned 21. Of course, they weren't children when they bought
them; they were adults.

So what did I do? Cleared space in the gun safe for the Savage, and
essentially "gave" my oldest son exclusive access to the small pistol
safe.

I also paid for a few visits to the local gun range so we could shoot
them all (along with my own metal babies). Fun times at the range.
