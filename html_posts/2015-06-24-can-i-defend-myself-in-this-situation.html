**Content:** [The slap is what is universally known as \"assault.\" In
some states, it is further broken down to \"assault\" (verbal), and
\"battery\" (physical). The threats are a civil assault, and could be a
crime.\
\
You always have a legal right to self-defense. Where the lines get
blurry is pre-emptive strike. You see the fist. It\'s cocked back. You
know the punch is coming. Do you have the legal right to strike first,
before the punch comes? That\'s a tricky situation. The lynchpin in your
case is that **the assault and battery already happened.** Your strike
is just defending yourself, since you were already assaulted and you
have a clear belief that the striking will continue (you see a fist
cocked back and ready to strike). Even if you are arrested for assault
and battery, this can be your defense in court.\
\
I would caution you to ensure you use the minimum amount of force to
stop the attacker from continuing to attack. Virginia law allows for you
to defend yourself from an assault, so your actions would be defensible
only to stop the attack. If the person is down and you continue hitting,
you now become the aggressor. For blowhards like this, a good gut shot
that knocks the wind out of him will generally do the trick (plus, since
he\'s probably drunk, he\'ll have to stop and puke after the gut shot,
so still gives you plenty of time to get to safety). You might even
consider a nut shot. Remember, fighting is never fair. There\'s no such
thing as a \"low blow\" in a street fight. This isn\'t pro boxing.
You\'re trying to stop the furtherance of an assault. Just ensure you
use the minimum amount of force needed to get out of the situation, and
legally you should be fine.]{.rendered_qtext}
