**Is it really impeachment if the articles don\'t go to the Senate?**

Indeed it is. The President has most certainly been impeached.

There's zero chance that he will be removed from office if the articles
never make it to the Senate.

There's only a statistical chance that he would be removed from office
even if they do make it to the Senate, but it's a statistically
insignificant chance.

If the articles *don't* go to the Senate, Trump and his team will use
the heck out of this incident in their campaigning, and continued delays
will only hurt House Democrats.
