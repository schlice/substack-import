So it sounds like you're talking about the enlisted oath. The officer
oath doesn't say anything about obeying orders. But that's just a side
note.

Yes, the oath says to obey the orders of the President and the officers
appointed over them, but then it says something else about those orders:

> ***according to regulations and the Uniform Code of Military
> Justice***

So they are to obey orders according to regulations and the UCMJ.

So what do regulations and the UCMJ say about those orders? **They must
be lawful.** So if a president orders the military to do something
clearly unconstitutional, the military member is bound by regulation and
the UCMJ to refuse to follow that order. It really doesn't matter what
the order may be. If a superior orders someone to do something which
violates the Constitution, the member is duty-bound to refuse that
order.
