**Are there any benefits to HOA\'s?**

1.  The primary goal of an HOA is to maintain home prices as high as you
    can get them. How? A neat neighborhood (trash picked up, lawns
    mowed, cars not littering the streets) sells houses. Ask any
    realtor. A prospective homeowner is buying the house from the minute
    they enter the neighborhood. It may be a great house, but if it's in
    a crappy neighborhood, they're going to pass. And when your
    neighbor's house is well-kept, you get max dollar for your house.
    That is the true goal of an HOA.
2.  The goal of the HOA is not to control what you do in order to keep
    your home value high. The goal of the HOA is to control what *your
    neighbors* do to keep your home value high. What you do to the
    inside of your house is your business. But what you do to the
    outside of your house affects your neighbors. That's where the HOA
    steps in.
3.  The HOA can negotiate group discounts on services such as trash
    removal and recycling. For example, it costs roughly \$20 per month
    for trash service to a single family home here in Colorado Springs.
    Through bulk purchasing, we were able to negotiate the exact same
    service for \$8/home, and we rolled it into the HOA dues, ***without
    increasing dues.*** We now provide trash service to the entire
    neighborhood. This is also great for traffic control. In the middle
    of winter, with cars getting to work and kids getting to school and
    school buses and snowy roads, the last thing we need is trash trucks
    trying to fight their way through, clogging the streets every day of
    the week because every trash company collects on a different day.
    Similarly, we don't allow homeowners to park their cars on the
    street. Less traffic clogging up the small streets is as much of a
    safety issue as it is a beautification issue.
4.  The HOA has more pull with the City. If there is a city issue
    affecting the neighborhood (such as street paving, drainage, street
    lights, etc), the HOA, as a representative of X number of homeowners
    and a relatively large community, can negotiate with city leaders to
    correct those issues.
