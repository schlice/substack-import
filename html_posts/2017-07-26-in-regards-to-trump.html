No, and no.

The 14th Amendment prevents the government from applying laws in an
unequal way. It says nothing about how the federal government (and the
military) can spend its money. If the military chooses to not spend
\$3.7 billion over 10 years on gender reassignment surgery, hormone
therapy, and the cost of being a person down for a year while they
recover and go through their Real Life Experience therapy, they can make
that choice.

Also, since transgenderism is not a protected class under the Civil
Rights Act, the military (as an employer) can discriminate against
transgendered individuals if it can show clear reasons why doing so
furthers their mission, vision, and values.

As to Russia, the media has bought in to the whole Russia thing; they
have no choice but to ride that ship for all it's worth, and go down
with it if need be. They will play the Russia story daily to keep it
fresh in your minds. Despite the fact that there's nothing there of any
real substance. At. All. I mean, seriously. Don't you find it odd that
we switched from "interfering in the election" to "collusion" which
isn't even a thing? What does that even mean? Does that mean "supporting
a candidate?" The United States does that, and more, all the time, and
we have done it for many, many years. How then is Russia supporting
Trump (even if they did, which I doubt) any different? So every
political donor is "colluding" to get that candidate elected? Remember,
we've gone away from "interfering" and we're simply on to "colluding."
The circus continues...
