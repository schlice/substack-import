**How can someone beat a ticket from a traffic camera?**

A lot of people here will tell you "don't run red lights." While an
obvious answer, it doesn't help you if you've already gotten a ticket in
the mail.

Legally speaking, there are lots of things you can do, but the problem
is that laws for red light cameras and how they are implemented vary by
state. You're going to have to research your local laws and see what you
can do.

For example, here in Colorado, we have a number of cities with red light
cameras. Here, **you can choose to simply not pay the ticket.** State
law says that the city has 90 days to serve you with the ticket, or it
is invalid. And any city process server can serve you with the ticket;
it does not have to be a police officer. And they don't have to serve
the driver; any adult at the driver's home can be served with the ticket
and it is valid. Here, you would have to try to avoid the process server
for three months, and they work odd hours so they can catch an adult at
home. Don't be surprised if someone rings your doorbell at 6:00 AM. They
may also try to send the ticket via certified mail. If you don't sign
for it within the 90 day window, the ticket is similarly invalid.

*Once they know someone has received the ticket,* and you don't pay, the
fine goes up. And while it doesn't add points to your license, if you
fail to pay and they send it to collections, it can negatively impact
your credit score.

**If you can prove that it was not you driving the car**, you can also
get out of the ticket, but you will have to prove it. For example, if a
male owns the car and a female was driving it at the time, it may be as
simple as sending them a copy of your driver's license so they can see
that you were not the driver.

Also law on the books here in Colorado: **red light cameras and speed
vans must have posted signs warning drivers**. This is why you need to
research your local laws. If you saw the camera flash but you didn't see
a sign, you should drive around the block and check for signage. Take
pictures of the intersection and take note of any signage that is
missing. You could then use that information to dispute the ticket in
court. You should ideally do that on the same day you see the camera
flash so that you can say, "I saw the flash and drove around the block
and took these pictures" so that you can show the lack of signage on the
day of the incident.

That's just an example of three things you can do in Colorado to get out
of a red light camera violation, but again, these are highly dependent
on Colorado law. There are others depending on the type of violation you
receive (for example, if you didn't run the light but you are blocking
the crosswalk, it will send you a smaller fine for that).
