It doesn't sound like you were legally joined, because you said that
when your status changed, you "broke up." So therefore, if your partner
bought the phone outright for you, and gave it to you, it would be
considered a "gift" and you would now own the phone.

If the phone was a contract phone and you were not paying the contract,
you don't actually own the phone, the phone company does. So you'd have
to give it back to the phone company if your partner cancels the
contract.

In any other scenario (even through an Equipment Installment Plan), the
phone is purchased (even if the partner is still paying it off). If the
phone was purchased in any way and then given to you, it is a gift, and
you own it.

But in all fairness, it's an iPhone 6s. You can get a much better phone
on your own with your own service plan. I'd recommend you wipe it and
give it back. Just be done with your partner. Move on.

Make sure you turn off "Find My iPhone" before you wipe it.
