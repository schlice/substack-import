**Are police officers allowed to cover their body cameras?**

The answer is "it depends."

It depends on the city's rules for when police must use their cameras,
and what the department says about what they are and are not allowed to
record.

Generally, police officers don't have to cover their cameras because
they are permitted to turn them off in certain situations, such as
recording a sensitive conversation.

These rules are entirely up to the jurisdiction and the department.
