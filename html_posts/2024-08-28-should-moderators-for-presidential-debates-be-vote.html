No, I don't think so. I think it is sufficient that both parties agree
to the terms of the debate.

Personally, I'd like to see multiple debates in multiple formats (town
hall, Lincoln-Douglas, etc.) to truly assess the candidates. But it's
unlikely that the parties will agree to that. These debates are hardly
debates anyway (for any of you who have been in the NSDA, you know
exactly what I'm talking about).

*(And I'm old enough to have been in the NSDA back when it was called
the NFL, the National Forensic League, and I could truthfully say that I
was in the NFL)*
