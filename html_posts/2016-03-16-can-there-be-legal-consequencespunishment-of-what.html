If I understand your question correctly, you are asking whether or not a
writer on Quora can be prosecuted by recommending that someone do
something or not do something, and when that someone does or does not do
that thing, they get arrested, and then attempt to lay blame on the
Quora writer for recommending that action.

Whether or not someone admits to a crime on Quora is a different
question altogether.

Quora is governed by the laws of the United States. My speech is
protected by the First Amendment.

I can tell you to go kill someone. I can even suggest that you do it
(unless I suggest you kill a dignitary, like the president, which could
possibly be illegal just for saying it). My speech may be a directive to
commit a crime, but I am not complicit in your crime unless I have
conspired with you to commit a crime. Conspiracy is an agreement between
persons to break the law. By my suggesting ***you*** break the law, I am
not engaging in conspiracy. I am merely suggesting what you should do,
which is protected free speech. Whether or not you accept my suggestion
is entirely up to you. You are responsible for your own actions, and you
are responsible for ensuring that your actions are legal before you do
them, which requires the advice of a licensed attorney, not a random
person on the Internet.

If I were a police officer (an agent of the state) and I recommend you
break a law, and you then do it and I arrest you for doing it, I may be
guilty of the offense of \"entrapment.\" However, that does not apply in
the scenario you listed.

It\'s possible that my speech could be considered \"fighting words,\" or
words that cause imminent danger or imminent breach of the peace, just
by my saying them, but it is unlikely in this medium, and nothing in my
suggestion is so inflammatory that it places anyone in imminent danger
of harm.

Besides the \"fighting words\" example, you also cannot say anything
that is untrue about someone that causes them harm (also known as
slander or libel).

Outside of those limitations on free speech, I can say what I like. I
can even suggest you should break the law. I can even suggest you do
something I think is legal. If you do it, and you haven\'t confirmed
that it is actually legal in your jurisdiction, the responsibility for
what you have done rests on you. You would be laughed out of court if
you say, \"I got advice from some random person on the Internet.\"

Beyond that, people who answer legal questions on Quora (and questions
about whether or not something is legal is, by definition, a legal
question) are protected by the \"Intended Third-Party Beneficiary\"
clause in Quora\'s Terms of Service.

> In no event shall Quora or Legal & Medical Contributors be liable for
> any damages (including, without limitation, incidental and
> consequential damages, personal injury / wrongful death, lost profits,
> or damages resulting from lost data or business interruption)
> resulting from the use of or inability to use the Site or the Content,
> whether based on warranty, contract, tort, or any other legal theory,
> and whether or not Quora or its Legal & Medical Contributors is

> Legal & Medical Contributors are liable for any personal injury,
> including death, caused by your use or misuse of the Site or Content.

So if you use, or misuse, the content that someone posted on this site,
then neither Quora nor the contributor can be held liable.

Basically, legal advice can only legally be dispensed by a lawyer.
That\'s why legal advice given on Quora is for general informational use
only, it is not genuine legal advice. If you tell someone what you think
is legal and they act on that, they are misusing the information on the
website.

Disclaimers are there to remind people that they shouldn\'t be using
advice they get on the Internet as bona-fide legal or medical advice.
The actual teeth of the rules are contained in Quora\'s TOS.
