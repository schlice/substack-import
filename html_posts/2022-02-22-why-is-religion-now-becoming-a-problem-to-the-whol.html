Because religious beliefs are *naturally* exclusive. If I believe that
Islam is true, then I therefore believe that anything that is not Islam
*is not true*. If I believe that Christianity is true, then I believe
that anything that is not Christianity is not true.

This directly contradicts the concept of "tolerance" and "pluralism"
promoted in today's society, because *society sees "tolerance" as more
than just "coexisting."* Society's definition of "tolerance" today means
not just treating those with different ideas civilly and respectfully.
"Tolerance" today means ***affirming their ideas are valid*,** which
traditional religious people (Christians especially) cannot do without
denying their own beliefs. For example, if you believe that the Bible
says that homosexual behavior is sinful, you can't at the same time
agree that homosexual behavior is not sinful.

**TL;DR:** Religion is a problem because religion teaches that absolute
truth exists and can be known. Religion is now becoming a problem
because society's *belief about truth* is changing, and religion is not.

I gave a little more context about truth in another answer I wrote
today:

[[Bill Stein\'s answer to I can't stand the phrase "speak my truth", can
you give suggestions for anything else we can say for that
concept?](/I-can-t-stand-the-phrase-speak-my-truth-can-you-give-suggestions-for-anything-else-we-can-say-for-that-concept/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container}

So understand this was a secular answer, but this is especially poignant
when applied to Christianity.

The postmodern secularists (some of whom answered that question) don't
have to address the intrinsic contradictions in their views. They
**reject** the idea of absolute truth and the Law of Noncontradiction.
They just flit along their merry way moralizing to everyone about "new
Tolerance." These "tolerance peddlers" are exposed as frauds when you
realize that they don't practice what they preach, especially when it
comes to Christians. They certainly don't "tolerate" that Jesus is the
only way to salvation, as this would invalidate their ideas about
tolerance. To them, our insistence that absolute truth exists and that
Christ is the author of truth is so beyond the pale as to *disqualify
Christians from receiving the tolerance of others.* To justify their
positions, they use pithy (but logically incongruent) statements such
as, "we cannot tolerate the intolerant." They say these with a straight
face, not even realizing the glaring contradiction in their logic.

But when Christians claim that there is one true religion, this doesn't
mean that they are intolerant or disrespectful of others or their
beliefs. Modern culture has been intentionally confused by these
distinctions, so much so that they feel comfortable enough in their
confusion to paint the Christian as intolerant of those who believe
differently. However, we should realize that Christianity is not the
only religion which makes truth claims. All major religions make such
claims, which belies their assertion that all religions essentially
believe the same thing, but through different views. So much for
pluralism, eh? (NOTE: I said all *major* religions; this would
necessarily exclude belief systems like those found in sects like
[[Progressive
Christianity](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7cf4eb&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Christianity){.external_link

illogical contradiction.)
