Maybe, if that's your target demographic, then contemporary music might
be a wise choice. *Serve the flock you have, don't serve the flock you
want.*

Or, you can play heavy metal church music and attract bikers.

*Welcome to the First Heavy Metal Church of Jesus Christ.* I'll never
get over that line.

When the Barbershop Harmony Society starts to do church services,
someone please let me know, because I'd be attracted to that.
