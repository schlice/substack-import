The Old Testament stories which came from Judaism were written thousands
of years before Jesus was born. People argue about whether or not the
things in the Old Testament actually happened, like a worldwide flood.
But there is plenty of evidence that a worldwide flood did occur.
Skeptics like to poo poo on the evidence, but it is there.

The problem is that the people who poo poo all over the evidence don't
believe in the existence of miracles. We know miracles are real because
the most miraculous event of all time, the creation of the universe and
everything in it out of nothing, has already taken place. If you believe
in that miracle (and your existence should easily allow you to believe
it), then believing the rest of the miraculous claims of the Bible
should be easy.

We know that the New Testament speaks the truth because we have accurate
copies of the original documents that were written down in the first
century, and those documents speak the truth. How do we know they speak
the truth? We test the New Testament documents against criteria
historians often use to determine whether or not to believe a given
historical document. We'll refer to these criteria as "historical
tests." They include:

1.  Do we have early testimony? Generally, the earlier the sources, the
    more accurate is the testimony.
2.  Do we have eyewitness testimony? Eyewitness testimony is usually the
    best means of establishing what really happened.
3.  Do we have testimony from multiple, independent, eyewitness sources?
    Multiple, independent eyewitnesses confirm that the events really
    occurred (they are not fiction), and provide additional details that
    a single source might miss. (True independent sources normally tell
    the same basic story but with differing details. Historians
    sometimes call this "coherence with dissimilarity.")
4.  Are the eyewitnesses trustworthy? Should you believe them? Character
    matters.
5.  Do we have corroborating evidence from archaeology or other writers?
    This adds further confirmation.
6.  Do we have any enemy attestation? If opponents of the eyewitnesses
    admit certain facts the eyewitnesses say are true, then those facts
    probably are true (for example, if your mother says you are brave,
    that might be true; but it's probably more credible if your
    archenemy says the same thing).
7.  Does the testimony contain events or details that are embarrassing
    to the authors? Since most people do not like to record negative
    information about themselves, any testimony that makes the author
    look bad is probably true.

In most cases, documents that meet most or all of these historical tests
are considered trustworthy beyond a reasonable doubt. Unsurprisingly,
the New Testament passes all of these historical tests with flying
colors, so we know the New Testament speaks the truth.
