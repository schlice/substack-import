An Entry-Level Separation (ELS) is a discharge which occurs during the
first 180 days of enlistment. It is a recognition that not everyone is a
"good fit" for military duty.

However, **you** don't seek an ELS. ELS is not a program that allows you
to quit within the first 180 days. ELS is a program which allows
**commanders** to separate you without a characteristic of service
instead of discharging you if you can't be rehabilitated to fit the
military lifestyle, or if you refuse to do so. Be aware, they will try.
They will send you for remedial training, or they will discipline you if
needed.

Commanders can **discharge** you instead of doing an ELS, and the
characterization of your discharge can affect all sorts of things like
future benefits or ability to be drafted, or your ability to re-enlist
if you choose.

But to answer your question, if they try to work with you and it simply
isn't working, a commander can ELS or discharge you, and you will
immediately begin the process of **out-processing**. You have a form to
fill out which closes out all of your interests at all of the offices on
the base which track you. You have to visit all of those places, they do
their thing to remove you, and they sign off on your form. The amount of
time it takes you to out-process is dependent on how long it takes each
one of these agencies to complete their portions and sign off on your
form.

Once it's complete, you take your form to Transportation, who will
arrange for transport back to the city of your home of residence. Your
personal effects can be packaged and sent ahead to your home of
residence, and that's it. You walk out the door and you go on with your
life.[\[1\]](#OsoID){#cite-OsoID .citation_link}

What is the process of getting discharged with an ELS or general
discharge? How will I get home? What is the timeline?
