Ah yes, the "abortion as self-defense" argument.

So let's first start all discussions about abortion with the
acknowledgement that pregnancy is hard. It is life-changing for the
woman. We fully understand how difficult pregnancy can be on a woman.

But is it "life-threatening?" Well, it can be. But does that mean we can
kill the baby in self-defense? Shouldn't we have the right to protect
ourselves, even if it means killing someone, if our life is at risk?

First, we must understand the difference between a **threat** and an
**aggressor**. Calling the baby a violent aggressor, even an innocent
one, is a misleading description of what happens in pregnancy.
**Aggressors directly put others in danger; threats put others in danger
only indirectly or without intention, by proximity or circumstance.**
For example, if I drop a bowling ball out of the window of a tall
building, I'm the *aggressor* towards the person walking below, the
bowling ball is only the *threat*. While complications in pregnancy may
add risks for the mother, the fetus never *directly* causes the mother
harm. While **aggressors** are *directly* responsible for their actions
and subject to punishment, this isn't true of **threats**. You don't
punish the bowling ball for the actions of the dropper. You don't punish
the gun for the actions of the gun operator. And **you can't use
disproportionate force to repel a threat** ***without yourself becoming
an aggressor*, which makes you the one in the wrong.**

To that end, it is clear that the baby is not an aggressor (because the
baby does not directly put the mother in danger), but only a threat.

\

Now that we have determined that the baby is a threat (and not an
aggressor), before we determine whether or not we can kill the baby to
protect ourselves from the threat, we have to make sure we only use
proportionate force to do so. In other words, we need to evaluate *how
much* of a risk the baby is to the mother's life. If there is a 75%
chance she will die, then morally permissible options look very
different from a 10% chance.

***The risk to the woman's life that pregnancy poses doesn't even come
close to a reasonable risk to justify the use of force to end it.***

It's not a 75% risk. It's not a 10% risk. *It isn't even a 1% risk.* In
the United States in 2016, a pregnant woman had a [[**0.017% chance of
dying**](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9daadc&url=https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternal-mortality/pregnancy-mortality-surveillance-system.htm%23ratio){.external_link

pregnancy-related complication.** You actually have a higher risk of
death from getting your appendix removed, which is[ [0.21% chance for

There are some other facets to this argument that must be accepted in
order to cogently state that abortion as self-defense is valid, along
with the idea that the fetus is an aggressor:

1.  The idea that abortion is safer for the woman than childbirth.
2.  The idea that consent to sex is not consent to pregnancy.

We can individually evaluate each one of those, but those arguments are
not strong either, and you need to make those arguments in order to make
the case that abortion is a valid form of self-defense. So the "abortion
as self-defense" argument is already weak, and it sits on a foundation
of weak premises.
