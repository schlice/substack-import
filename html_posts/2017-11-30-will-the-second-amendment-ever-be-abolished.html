It's a pretty high bar to get over.

You need either a Constitutional Convention (proposed by 2/3 of the
states), or a 2/3 majority of both houses of Congress to even propose an
amendment to repeal the 2nd Amendment.

Once you get that, you still need 3/4 of the states to ratify it before
it becomes part of the Constitution.

Like [[Eric](https://www.quora.com/profile/Eric-5265)]{.qlink_container}
said, it's impossible to predict the future, but do you think it's
possible that majorities in 38 states will ratify an amendment to repeal
the 2nd Amendment, given its current and historic strong support, as
well as similar language existing in nearly every state constitution?

I don't see it happening any time soon.
