Different engines.

Fighter jets use turbojet engines. Commercial aircraft used to use them
as well, but they have all switched to turbofan engines, which provide
large amounts of thrust at vast fuel savings. This is a cutaway view of
a turbofan:

There is a great deal of bypass air that goes around the actual jet
engine portion, which quiets the noise significantly. That's why they
are called "high-bypass turbofan engines."

Fighter jets use turbojet engines (just the interior portion of the
turbofan):

Many fighter jets today use "low-bypass" turbofans, which are basically
turbojets with small amounts of bypass air which cools the combustion
chamber and provides extra oxygen for the afterburner. There is little
to no noise suppression on military jets
