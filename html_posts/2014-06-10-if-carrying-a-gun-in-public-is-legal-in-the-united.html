**Content:** [I live in Colorado. We allow open carry here. I see it all
the time. People don\'t bat an eye (usually) around here when they see
someone open carry.\
\
The difference is \*what\* they carry openly that will determine if
there is an issue.\
\
Most people who open carry will have a pistol on their hip; no big deal.
On rare occasion, you will see someone carry an AR-15 or a rifle.
**THIS** is what attracts attention. It\'s certainly not illegal, but it
does raise eyebrows and sometimes causes some calls to police, because
the Aurora theater shooter and Columbine are all still fresh in
Coloradan\'s minds. The police then have to investigate, determine
whether or not the person is following the law, reassure the nearby
public, and leave.\
\
By the way, these people are usually carrying AR-15s and other long guns
in public because they are trying to demonstrate that they have the
right to do so (the \"right-to-open-carry\" crowd). It\'s a hassle for
everyone involved. Many times, they will video the entire police
encounter to try to trick the police into violating a right so that they
can file suit against the department. Usually, as long as the police
were acting in good faith and in the interest of the public at large,
the suits are dropped. But it requires a full-time legal staff at the
police department to handle this stuff. See the hassle
