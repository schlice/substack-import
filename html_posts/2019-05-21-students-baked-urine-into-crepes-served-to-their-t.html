**Students baked urine into crepes served to their teachers, and are
being investigated for felony assault. I agree that this is disgusting,
but legally how can this be considered assault? Is it based on a written
statute or case law?**

Written statute.

Nearly every assault statute involves the crime of intentional harm
inflicted on one person by another. Normally, simple assaults are
misdemeanors.

But as you know, all states are different. In Ohio, when an assault
happens in this manner, it is a fifth degree felony:

> The victim of the offense is a school teacher or administrator or a
> school bus operator, and the offense occurs in a school, on school
> premises, in a school building, on a school bus, or while the victim
> is outside of school premises or a school bus and is engaged in duties
> or official responsibilities associated with the victim\'s employment
> or position as a school teacher or administrator or a school bus
> operator, including, but not limited to, driving, accompanying, or
> chaperoning students at or on class or field trips, athletic events,
> or other school extracurricular activities or functions outside of
> school premises. ([[ORC 2903.13

Ohio has special protections for teachers written into their law.
