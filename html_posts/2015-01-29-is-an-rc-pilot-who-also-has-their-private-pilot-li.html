**Content:** [What could go wrong with an RC flight that would risk a
private pilot\'s license?\
\
I mean, the worst that could possibly happen is that an RC flight kills
someone on the ground and the cause was found to be gross negligence of
the pilot. I suppose his pilot\'s license could be called into question
because of his gross negligence, but RC flying skills are in no way
connected to private pilot\'s licenses. At all.]{.rendered_qtext}
