**If an assault requires a witness, and crimes by nature are secretive,
where does that leave justice for victims?**

Your assumptions in the lead-up to your question are not correct.

**If an assault requires a witness**

Assaults do not "require" a witness. As in any crime, to prove "beyond a
reasonable doubt" that the defendant committed the specified crime, you
need ***evidence.*** Witness testimony is great evidence, but so too is
DNA evidence, surveillance camera footage, doctor's medical examination
reports, credit card receipts, electronic toll records, and many other
items of evidence which can show when and where a person was located
(and sometimes what they were doing) at any given time. All of the
evidence is compiled and is used to reach above that "reasonable doubt"
standard.
