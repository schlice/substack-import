First of all, it's great to have a goal. And being a fighter pilot is a
great goal.

But in the military, you are an **officer** first, and a **job** second.

I'll tell you why I know this.

My particular class had over 1000 PQ (pilot qualified) cadets in it. But
the early 90s saw the military shrinking in size after Desert Storm, a
process called a *drawdown*. The problem they were facing in 1992 and
1993 was that there were too many pilots coming out of UPT
(Undergraduate Pilot Training) and not enough airframes for them to fly.
To address the immediate problem, the Air Force was placing pilots in
non-flying jobs because we had nowhere else to put them, and no planes
to give them.

The next thing the Air Force did was to slow down the amount of people
going *into* UPT, meaning they cut back on the number of pilot slots in
UPT. *That directly affected the number of pilot slots for my class.*
With over 1000 pilot qualified cadets, we got **225** pilot slots.
**That meant that 3/4ths of us PQ cadets were not going to fly.**

We learned this just before we were to incur an Active Duty Service
Commitment from attending USAFA (at the beginning of our junior year),
so we had a chance to leave with no commitment. We could take our
credits to a civilian university, and with the number of credit hours
cadets carry, we probably could have graduated with a BS in just one
more year.

But only a handful of cadets left.

*Why*?

Because we are **Air Force officers first*,*** *and jobs second.*

An important lesson to learn is that you go where the military tells you
that you are needed. It may not be the most glamorous job, or the most
glamorous location, or the most prestigious career field, but the Air
Force will take care of you.

I was commissioned as a Communications Officer (AFSC 33S). It was a good
job. I worked in NORAD. That was fun.

Anyway, the moral of the story is you're an officer first, and a job
second.

Okay, now that that's out of the way, how do you maximize your chance of
being a fighter pilot? Statistically, there are more pilots in the *Air
Force* (the name kinda gives it away) then there are in the Navy. No
disrespect meant at all to my naval aviator brethren, but there simply
are far fewer of you to go around. So if you want to *maximize* your
chance to become a fighter pilot, join the Air Force.

However, actual in-aircraft fighter pilot slots are diminishing. RPA
pilots are ramping up. RPA is short for Remotely Piloted Aircraft.
*Drones*.

RPA pilots are *in demand* right now.

That doesn't mean we don't still need in-aircraft pilots. We do. But
those slots are diminishing as well, so be aware of that.

How to prepare for a service academy in middle school? Here's some
practical things you can do:

- Get good grades. Keep your grades as good as you can get them. Focus
  on doing really well in your *high school* classes, don't worry so
  much about taking things like AP or College level classes. Those are
  less important than doing really well in school.
- Participate in a team sport. If you don't have one yet, join one. You
  don't have to be the Team Captain or the best player on the team, but
  consistently being a valuable team member will be important.
- Start thinking about what you can do in your community, outside of
  school. Maybe some volunteer work, or participating in your church.

The academies follow the "whole person" concept. They don't want someone
who is a "one-trick pony." They don't want the guy who is a 4.5 GPA but
hasn't participated in a team sport or did any community service. They
want the guy who is the 3.75 GPA who was the MVP of the cross country
team and who serves in his church and volunteers at the library. That's
an example, but you get the point. They are looking for what we used to
call the "well-rounded" applicant. But you need to be well-rounded and
good at everything that you do. Good grades, good athletically, and a
history of community involvement. Proven leadership in multiple areas is
better than proven leadership in just one area.

Hope that helps. If you have more questions, you can visit the Air Force
Academy admissions website. It's good to check it out now since it has
lots of helpful information on how to prepare.
