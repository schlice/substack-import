[[Paul

has it spot on. You\'re going to contact a local *recruiter* if you plan
on skipping college and enlisting. You\'re going to contact an *Air
Force ROTC admissions representative* if you plan on joining ROTC at
college and graduating as an officer. These are two separate career
routes. The first (talking to the local recruiter) will send you down
the enlisted career path. The second (joining ROTC in college) will send
you down the officer career path.

If you truly are looking at Air Force ROTC (by the way, great choice),
you should start by looking closely at [[the Air Force ROTC Official
Website](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5abb82&url=http://www.afrotc.com){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="afrotc.com"}]{.qlink_container}. You will find all of the
information you will need, including the list of over 1100 colleges
which offer Air Force ROTC, scholarship information for an ROTC
scholarship, listings of ROTC admissions representatives who can help
you with all phases of your application process, and frequently asked
questions about everything from college life as an ROTC cadet to the
kinds of careers you can look forward to as an Air Force officer.

I would definitely start now (it\'s never too early to start) by
contacting your local ROTC admissions representative, whose contact
information you can find on the ROTC website.

For right now, get the best grades you can get, make sure you are
participating in a team sport (ideally, since that\'s the best way to
meet your fitness goals) or be following a well-documented workout
regimen, and be participating in extracurricular activities both in your
school and in your community. This will put you in the best position to
be ready to enter college and be successful as an Air Force ROTC cadet
and future Air Force officer.

Keep asking questions, and good luck!
