**What does the law expect when an armed civilian requests proof from a
potential police imposter beyond their equipment and their word that
they are law enforcement?**

"The law" is incredibly variable, as it is not Federal law (as they have
no jurisdiction over individual police departments) and is most often
not state law either. This means it's up to department policy as to
whether and when an officer must show ID.

Most departments do require their officers show some form of ID, but
they also have wide latitude to deny the request if it will jeopardize
safety or hamper police work (i.e. they are not required to stop what
they're doing in order to show you their ID on demand).

Whether or not the requester is armed makes zero difference in whether
or not an officer must identify himself.
