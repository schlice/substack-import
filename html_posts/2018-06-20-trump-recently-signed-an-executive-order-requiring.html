**Trump recently signed an executive order requiring children and
parents to be detained together; is this progress or a band-aid
distracting from a larger problem?**

Of course it's a band aid!

Congress needs to **do its job** and change the law if they don't like
it. But they're too busy being embroiled in partisan politics. Democrats
are too eager to keep using this issue to hold Trump's feet to the fire
(so they think) to score political points. Republicans are too willing
to try to get everything and the kitchen sink into a bill which they
know Democrats won't sign so that they can use the Democrat's refusal to
sign to beat them about the head and shoulders for refusing to sign.

Congress is a complete mess.

The only thing the President can do, rightly, is to sign an Executive
Order which is patently illegal on its face, as it violates Federal law,
detaining children for longer than 20 days. You can expect an injunction
from the 9th Circuit within a day or so. It will prevent the Executive
Order from going into effect because it is patently illegal.

If Trump can do something else, like make deportations go faster (within
the 20 days), that would be something that would be both legal and
acceptable because it keeps families together.
