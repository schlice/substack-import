You're right, you need faith alone to get into heaven. *Sola fide*.

However, **faith produces works**. Every. Single. Time. Therefore, if
you don't see works, you can rest assured that the requisite faith isn't
there either.

Faith begets works. So works is a good indication of faith.

The passage that comes to mind is **James 2:14--26:**

> What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does
> not have works? Can that faith save him? If a brother or sister is
> poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, and one of you says to them,
> "Go in peace, be warmed and filled," without giving them the things
> needed for the body, what good is that? So also faith by itself, if it
> does not have works, is dead.

That's why faith without works is dead. The believer is *justified* by
his works. **Faith without works may be dead, but works without faith is
lame.**

How do we know this? **Matthew 7:21--23**:

> "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of
> heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.
> On that day many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in
> your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works
> in your name?' And then will I declare to them, 'I never knew you;
> depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.'"

They did the works, but they didn't have the faith in Christ alone.
Works without faith will get you nowhere. It is the faith that produces
the works. The works are the sign that points to the faith. Works which
come from faith are the only works that count.

**TL;DR: It is faith that saves, but faith without works isn't faith
that will save you.**
