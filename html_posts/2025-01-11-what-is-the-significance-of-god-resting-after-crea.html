This is a really significant question. Most people, including many of
the people who have answered this question, say that the Sabbath day is
a day of "rest." They frequently say God "rested" on the Sabbath.

But stop and think for a second. *Does the Almighty God of the Universeâ„¢
need to rest?*

No. He does not. He is ***all*** powerful. He needs *nothing*, not the
least of which is *rest*.

So calling the Sabbath day a "day of rest" is actually not an accurate
translation.

The Hebrew word translated as "rest" in Genesis 2:2 actually also means
"to cease or stop."

To that end, God "rested" on the seventh day because He was **done**. He
didn't need to create anything else. It was a purposeful stop.
Everything He desired to create had been made. He looked at His
creation, declared it "very good" (Genesis 1:31), and ceased from His
activity.

Six days of creation, and one day of ceasing from work. This actually is
what formed our modern seven-day week. We work for six days, and we
cease work on the seventh. God provided us the model for how to
structure our own lives, and it led to our current seven-day week,
although many today also cease work on the day before the Sabbath.
