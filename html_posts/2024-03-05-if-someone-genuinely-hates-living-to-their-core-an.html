Because decades of observation and scientific inquiry have proven and
re-proven that **hating living and having no will to go through life
is** ***abnormal.***

We recognize that it is not a normal human condition to hate life and
lose the will to live. This is considered a mental defect, an abnormal
functioning of the brain. It is a *medical condition*.

**We do not treat medical conditions with euthanasia.**

We treat medical conditions humanely, with counseling, therapy, and in
some cases, medication, where it helps.
