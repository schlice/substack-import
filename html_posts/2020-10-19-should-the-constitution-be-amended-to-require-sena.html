**Should the Constitution be amended to require Senate-approved members
of the executive branch to appear before House or Senate when called to
do so?**

No, for several reasons.

1.  A Constitutional amendment is unnecessary. We already have a
    mechanism to bring government officials before Congress. It's called
    a congressional subpoena.
2.  A Constitutional amendment would ignore the fact that Executive
    Branch appointees are merely *consented* by the Senate, not
    *appointed*. These appointees work for the Executive, not Congress.
3.  This Constitutionalizes a *power over* the Executive Branch, making
    the Legislative Branch arguably more powerful than the Executive
    Branch. In theory, the three branches of government are co-equal.
    1.  Along with this, this removes the ability of the Executive
        Branch to exercise *Executive Privilege,* erasing decades of
        judicial precedent.
