This is how a Federal fishing investigation works:

- Cast your net far and wide, and see who gets caught up in it.
- Get the closest person to the target you can get, and charge him with
  whatever sticks.
- Tell him that if he cooperates and tells you what he knows about your
  actual target, you'll let him off easy.

Flynn is being charged with the "Martha Stewart" crime (lying to a
Federal agent) because that's all they have on him that will stick. It's
insignificant only in its importance, not in its consequences. With the
number of lying charges they had on Flynn, he could have faced a maximum
of **60 years** (or the rest of his natural life) in Federal prison.

Instead, he pled guilty and will face somewhere between 6 and 12 months
in prison.

The obvious question, of course, is what did he have to give up in order
to get that plea deal? Did he have to give up anything at all?

The interesting point is that the lies that he told were about a
conversation he had with the Russian ambassador after the election. The
lies themselves weren't even related to the election. It was about a
conversation related to the sanctions the US was going to be placing on
the Russians for perceived interference in the election.

But to answer the question, how far this goes is yet to be seen. Did
they give him a plea deal just to show the nation that the investigation
yielded some fruit, even though it's not exactly what they were looking
for? Or is this part of something bigger?

Additionally, another question which is not being asked: Flynn was
caught in a lie because the NSA had recorded his phone conversation with
the Russian ambassador. How did the government get the warrant to tap
Flynn's phone? From where did they get the information needed to procure
that warrant? Did it come from the unlawful "unmasking" of information
from unrelated foreign operative recordings? This is something which, to
the best of everyone's knowledge, has yet to be investigated.
