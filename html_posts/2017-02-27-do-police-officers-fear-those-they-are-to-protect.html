Fear is the wrong word to use. As Mark Twain said, "Courage is
resistance to fear, mastery of fear, not absence of fear." Fear is a
useful emotion if it is used to heighten your senses, and make you more
acutely aware of your surroundings, and able to react to situations as
they unfold. Every cop feels that little twinge before they open that
door and step into that situation. You'd be a fool if you didn't.

But the situation of today is a different kind of fear. It's not fear of
the criminal. It's fear of the *prosecutor*. In high-crime areas like
Chicago, you also have highly litigious, sometimes anti-cop city
administrations. They are easily willing to indict a cop on a trumped-up
charge simply to assuage the public. Example: Baltimore. Marilyn Moseby.
Indicted six police officers on depraved-heart murder in the Freddy Gray
case just to stop a crowd from rioting. This story ended with all six
officers acquitted of murder charges (IIRC, one officer was charged with
a lesser offense), and Moseby facing the loss of her law license and
disbarment over what she did.

But this illustrates the true fear that officers face today.

From simply doing what they are charged with doing, they face riots,
mobs, and increased danger at the scene. Mobile phones are shoved in
their faces as people record the scene, hoping for *one little slip-up*
so they can get their 15 minutes of fame on YouTube. Officers are
harassed while they exercise their authority, because people have bought
the whole "all police officers are racist" lie.

What is the net from all of this? Officers are simply not initiating
discretionary stops anymore. They will still respond to victims who call
911, but discretionary stops are *way* down in many big cities. This has
led to the first significant spike in crime in over two decades.

All the worse for everyone.
