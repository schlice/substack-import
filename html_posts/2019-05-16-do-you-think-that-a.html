**Do you think that a \"sex strike,\" as a way to combat anti-abortion
laws is a good idea?**

***YES!!!!!!!! THIS IS AN ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC IDEA!!!!!***

However, not for the reasons its organizers had in mind.

1.  The anti-abortion law ultimately aims to reduce the number of
    abortions. A sex strike voluntarily decreases the number of
    abortions by voluntarily preventing unwanted pregnancies in the
    first place. So they are actually *helping* the pro-life cause.
    Thank you.
2.  They are protesting control over women's bodies by exerting control
    over other women's bodies. If you must be hypocritical in order to
    make your point, you likely have a very weak position to begin with.
3.  Conservative men and conservative women (who already have a modicum
    of self-control) won't be affected at all by this.
4.  Since children generally ideologically follow their parents, this
    will trigger an increase in conservative children, which will also
    decrease the need for anti-abortion laws.

Lol. Just lol.
