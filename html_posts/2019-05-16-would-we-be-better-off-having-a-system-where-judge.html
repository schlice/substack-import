**Would we be better off having a system where judges who are
knowledgeable about legal issues preside rather than civilian juries?**

A judge already is present in the courtroom and runs the proceedings. He
is indeed knowledgeable about legal issues.

However, a jury makes the important decision about whether or not the
prosecution met its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The
"reasonable person test" is employed, and that doesn't require legal
training to determine.

The right to a trial by jury is one of the reasons the colonies left
England in the first place. The Declaration of Independence accused King
George of \"depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of trial by
jury.\"

The Constitution has several places which protect the right of trial by
jury. Article III says that all trials shall be by jury. The 6th
Amendment protected the right to a jury even further, stating "\[i\]n
all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy
and public trial, by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein
the crime shall have been committed," and the 7th Amendment protected
the same right for civil cases.

Is a jury important? The Supreme Court

Trial by jury is one of the foundations of our legal system and should
never be tampered with.
