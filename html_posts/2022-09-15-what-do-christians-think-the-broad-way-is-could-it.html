This idea of "the broad way" versus the opposite, "the narrow way," is
directly out of the Sermon on the Mount. Matthew's Gospel details the
sermon.

I heard a comedian say, "The fact that there's a 'Highway to Hell' but a
'Stairway to Heaven' says a lot about predicted traffic volume."
Similarly, the fact that there is a "wide gate" versus a "narrow gate"
also says something about predicted traffic volume.

The gate which leads to destruction is wide. It's easy to pass through.
It doesn't require much effort, and it's really comfortable. There's
plenty of room on the road. You don't have to hunt for it, it's big and
bold, blocking your view. You can't miss it. But the gate which leads to
life is small, and the road you'll be traveling is narrow. It's more
difficult of a journey, as the road is clearly not well-traveled. The
gate is not grandiose, but small. It's not difficult to find, but it's
not dominating your view either.

This is literally an allegory for our decision to give ourselves to
Christ.

Living a life of sin is easy. We simply do what our bodies tell us they
want to do. Little effort is required, and we have a very easy journey
on a nice, wide road, through grand, broad gates. And that road leads
directly to Hell.

But choosing to give our lives to Jesus involves effort. It involves
introspection and acceptance that we are all sinners. It involves the
conscious decision to repent of (or turn away from) sin and turn towards
the life Jesus offers. It runs counter to what our bodies want to do.
It's therefore not easy, and few people will choose that path. The gate
is small, and the road is narrow.

So what is the "broad" way? It's the way of the world. It's the way that
the atheists and the naturalists and the "do-what-feels-good" crowd want
you to take. It's easy. There's little effort involved.

But the "narrow" road through the small gate is the way of Jesus. It's
not the easiest road, and it's not the most comfortable.

But it's not the road that counts in this case. It's the *destination.*

What do Christians think the broad way is? Could it be the false church
