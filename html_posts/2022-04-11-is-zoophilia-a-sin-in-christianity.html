Zoophilia is a mental disorder. This isn't my opinion. In the fifth
edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(DSM-5), zoophilia is listed as \"other specified paraphilic disorder\"
(\"paraphilias not otherwise specified\" in the DSM-III and IV).
*Paraphilia* is the experience of intense sexual arousal to atypical
objects, situations, fantasies, behaviors, or individuals. In the DSM-5,
it rises to the level of a diagnosable disorder only when accompanied by
distress or interference with normal functioning.

The World Health Organization takes the same position, listing a sexual
preference for animals in its tenth edition of the International
Classification of Diseases (ICD -10) as \"other disorder of sexual
preference.\"

Having a mental disorder is not a sin; it is a function of living in
sinful human bodies in a fallen world. *Acting on a mental disorder* can
indeed be sinful (and acting on this disorder would be), but having a
mental disorder is not.
