Everybody's answers are spot on here. A neurosurgeon who has specialized
in MS can certainly treat an MS patient. But it's like having a NASCAR
mechanic fix your car: it's overkill. Neurosurgeons are far more
specialized, and have moved from general neurology into neurosurgery, an
area which is decidedly not where MS lives.

You are, in general, better off finding a neurologist who specializes in
MS. You're most oft to find those in "MS centers" which is a neurology
department which specializes in treating MS. There, all of the
neurologists, PAs and nurses are MS specialists. If you need ancillary
care, they will refer you to specialists who are well-versed with MS.
For example, I needed a GI consult; my neurologist referred me to the GI
doc who was most well-versed in MS drugs, and had taken previous
referrals of MS patients on oral drugs.
