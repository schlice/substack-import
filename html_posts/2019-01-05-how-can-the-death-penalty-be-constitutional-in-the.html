**How can the death penalty be constitutional in the USA when the
constitution explicitly declares that the individual has an unalienable
right to life ("We hold these truths to be self-evident...")?**

The quote you gave is from the Declaration of Independence, and is not
actually legally binding.

The salient part is from the Constitution, the 14th Amendment:

> *No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the
> privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States;* ***nor
> shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property,
> without due process of law;*** *nor deny to any person within its
> jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.*

Note the sentence I highlighted. It's really important. It says that a
State many not deprive a person of life **without due process of law.**

Flip that around. It says that if you **do** have due process of law,
the State **can** deprive you of life.

It is universally assumed that your day in court and all of your appeals
are more than adequate due process.
