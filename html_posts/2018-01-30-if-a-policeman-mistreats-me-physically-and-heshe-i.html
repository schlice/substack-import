**If a policeman mistreats me physically and he/she is not authorized by
law, do I have the right to defend myself and neutralize him (or her)
temporarily?**

The big problem in your scenario is this:

**and he/she is not authorized by law**

If an officer is on duty, in uniform, and is arresting you, *you have no
way of knowing whether or not the arrest is authorized by law.*

Why? In the United States, ***the only agency authorized to determine
whether or not an arrest was lawful is a court***. Not you, not the
officer, not his supervisors, not your lawyer, but a judge in a court.
You should also note that this legal review of an arrest happens *long
after* the actual arrest takes place.

What makes an arrest lawful? A police officer has probable cause to
believe that you either committed a crime, or that you were about to
commit a crime. That's it. It's a much lower standard than a judge
determining whether or not you are guilty. You may be completely
innocent, but if the officer has probable cause to believe you may have
committed a crime, or you were about to commit a crime, then the arrest
is lawful. An officer can make a lawful arrest of an innocent person if
the probable cause is there.

But let's be honest. Is an officer going to have probable cause to
believe that an innocent person committed a crime? In most cases,
probably not. But it is conceivable that it would happen. You would
assume that the court system would validate that said innocent person
did not commit a crime, and that person would be released. But the court
system must be allowed to do its job; you cannot prevent the arrest from
taking place.
