What Texas should do is entirely up to Texas.

What the Texas legislature should do is entirely up to the Texas
legislature and the voters in Texas.

I am a believer in equal rights for all humans. This means that the
fetus has a right to live, just like the mother has a right to live. In
my opinion (and in the opinion of the founders of this country), the
right to life is pre-eminent amongst the rights. That means that nothing
is more important than the right to life. All other rights are
subordinate to that. Therefore, if there is a conflict between the right
to life of the fetus and the right to bodily autonomy of the mother, the
right to bodily autonomy must ***cede*** to the right to life. This
isn't an "anti-woman" position, nor is it an "anti-women's healthcare"
decision. It's a right to life position. If you believe that the right
to life is the most important right we have, then all other rights must
take a back seat to the right to life..

**That's my personal opinion.**

But if I were a *legislator*, I would be more swayed by the **consent**
argument. You consent to pregnancy when you consent to sex. Therefore,
most pregnancies should not be terminated. However, in the case of rape,
there was no consent to sex, so there was no consent to pregnancy
either. To that end, if I were a legislator, I could see including a
provision in the case of rape.

However, I also understand that there is a case to be made which says
that the fetus is an innocent victim, just like the mother, and the
solution is not to kill the innocent victim. Doing so doesn't "treat"
rape. It may treat a *symptom* of rape, but it does so in the most
brutal and inhumane way possible.

It's a tough decision. Texas made the call that the majority of the
people of Texas wanted. You may have made a different decision had you
been a legislator in Texas. That's okay. We are allowed to have
different opinions.

You're welcome to discuss my opinion with me if you choose. But if you
just want to comment and tell me what an evil person I am because I want
to force women to be "baby factories" and have no rights at all, then
you didn't read what I wrote, and I will not discuss with you. I'll
simply delete your comment without a second thought and move on with my
life.

And as a side note, don't you find it interesting that all of the people
who support killing babies have already been born themselves? They have
"born privilege." They don't even recognize their privilege. Sheesh.
Check your privilege.
