**Do landlords have to comply with ADA?**

So the first thing you need to recognize is that there are two pieces of
legislation we need to look at. One is the ADA, and the other is the
Fair Housing Act. The ADA addresses places of **public accommodation**,
like restaurants, businesses, and hotels. So while ADA applies to
multifamily units (and might apply to areas like the clubhouse and the
rental office), it does not apply to the actual domiciles. The Fair
Housing Act addresses "domiciles" or "residences," places like rental
houses and apartments.

So to answer your question, landlords only have to comply with ADA in
areas of public accommodation. This would include places like the
clubhouse or the rental office, but not the actual domicile.

Let's then ask the follow-on question: **Do landlords have to comply
with the Fair Housing Act?**

The answer is a resounding "mostly." Most rental properties are indeed
covered under FHA, which states that a landlord cannot discriminate "in
the sale, lease, or rental of housing, or to make housing unavailable,
because of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or
national origin." That said, there are certain categories of housing
that are not covered:

> - **Owner-occupied buildings with four or fewer units.** The FHA
>   generally isn\'t applicable when a building has two to four units,
>   and the owner lives in one of them.
> - **Single-family homes rented without a broker.** The FHA doesn\'t
>   apply when a single-family house is sold or rented without a broker,
>   so long as the owner doesn't own more than three houses.
> - **Religious organizations.** If you\'re a religious organization
>   leasing apartments at a property that you\'re not operating for a
>   commercial purpose, you may legally limit occupancy or give
>   preferences to people of your organization\'s religion. However, the
>   FHA points out that this exception is strictly limited to religion
>   and cautions that a religious organization still can\'t discriminate
>   based on race, color, or national origin ([[42 U.S. Code ยง

> - **Private clubs.** If you\'re leasing apartments on behalf of a
>   private club and not for a commercial purpose, the FHA lets you
>   limit occupancy to your club\'s members.
> - **Senior housing.** The FHA includes \"familial status\" as one of
>   its seven protected classes, which refers to the presence of at
>   least one child under 18 living in a household. However, although
>   the FHA bans discrimination against families with children, you may
>   be exempt from this ban if your property qualifies as senior
>   housing. Exempt properties include those that fit the rules of 55
>   and older or 62 and older communities, or those that participate in
>   a federal, state or local senior housing
>   program.[\[1\]](#RobRL){#cite-RobRL .citation_link}

Persons with disabilities are protected under state and federal fair
housing laws, which provide that these individuals are entitled to
"reasonable modifications." A reasonable modification is a change in the
physical structure that will allow for an individual to enjoy the
dwelling unit.

**A reasonable modification in a single-family dwelling is the
responsibility of the tenant, not the property owner.** There are
agencies that provide funds for this type of modification so long as the
modification does not violate any local ordinances or fire codes.

You should contact the fair housing agency in your area for assistance
in requesting a ramp as a reasonable modification. If there is no fair
housing agency, contact the state Department of Fair Employment and
Housing or the federal Housing and Urban Development
Department.[\[2\]](#wzrNb){#cite-wzrNb
