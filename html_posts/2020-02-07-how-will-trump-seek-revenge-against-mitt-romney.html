**How will Trump seek revenge against Mitt Romney?**

No revenge needed. Romney (as with the majority of the current crop of
Democrats in Washington) has torpedoed himself. He stands alone. Romney
voted in Romney's perceived best interest. He didn't work to convince
any of his fellow Republicans to vote his way. He didn't seek advice
from any of his fellow Republicans. Romney "sought his own counsel."

The rest is up to the people of Utah.
