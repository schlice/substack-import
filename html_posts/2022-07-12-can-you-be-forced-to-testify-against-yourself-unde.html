Not in a criminal trial.

> No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous
> crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except

So if, in a criminal trial, you are asked a question which, if you
answer, will implicate you as a criminal, you do not have to answer that
question.
