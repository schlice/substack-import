No, opening a car door is opening a car door.

Opening a car door *and looking inside, seeing something in there that
couldn't be seen from the outside, and taking action on it* is a search.
If that search did not have a warrant, and did not have the permission
of the driver, it would be an unlawful search under the Fourth
Amendment.

Being able to see the item from the outside is important. If the item
could be seen from outside the car, it is covered under an exception to
the Fourth Amendment called "plain sight." If the item was visible in
plain sight, without any touching, it can be confiscated and used as
evidence. Additionally, that evidence becomes the probable cause needed
to effect a continued search.
