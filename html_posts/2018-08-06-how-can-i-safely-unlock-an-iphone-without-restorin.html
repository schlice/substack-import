**How can I unlock my iPhone without restoring it because my last backup
was last year?**

I'm assuming that you don't know the passcode.

The answer: **you can't.**

If you don't know the passcode, your only option is to erase the device.
If Find My iPhone is enabled, you can log in to
[[iCloud.com](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f30a9e&url=http://iCloud.com){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="icloud.com"}]{.qlink_container} and erase the device. This
will allow you to set it up again. You'll need to log back in to the
device with the iCloud account it was previously logged into in order to
set it up again, but if you don't have the passcode, you can't get in.
You have to erase and restore it.

And if you hadn't set up iCloud backups, you might lose quite a bit of
information.
