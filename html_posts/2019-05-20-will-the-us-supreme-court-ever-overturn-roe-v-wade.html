**Will the Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade?**

If they're smart, they will.

They will do so because they made a mistake when they ruled the first
time, on both *Roe v. Wade* and *Griswold v. Connecticut.*

**There is no right to privacy in the Constitution.** Not even in the
"emanations and penumbras" of the Constitution. You don't squint real
hard and turn your head sideways while you read the Constitution to try
to see things that simply aren't there. It's either there, or it's not.
And there is no right to privacy in the Constitution.

If there is some *other* reason that abortion should be a protected
right, then they should say so.

But a right to privacy? No, no such right exists in the Constitution.

**That doesn't mean that abortion should therefore be illegal. It**
***does*** **mean that it simply should not be a Constitutional right.**

(EDIT) And for those of you thinking that *Roe* is "settled law:"

1.  There is no such thing as "settled law." There is only good law, and
    bad law. Good law is challenged and easily overcomes the challenge.
    Bad law is challenged and is overturned because it cannot stand up
    to legal challenge.
2.  Don't forget that *Plessy v. Ferguson* was "settled law" for over 60
    years before the *Brown v. Board* decision was written (along with a
    few others) and *Plessy* was essentially overturned.
