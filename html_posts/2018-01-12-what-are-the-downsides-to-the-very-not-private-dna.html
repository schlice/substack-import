I would love to spend lots of time and fully detail the answers for you,
but why not promote a great YouTuber who has already done that, and has
illustrated it in a great way?

Destin over at Smarter Every Day is, literally, making people smarter,
every day. He did a very in-depth review of
**[[23andMe.com](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5f95e9&url=http://23andMe.com){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="23andme.com"}]{.qlink_container}**, which you should really
take the time and watch, especially if you are concerned at all about
what information these DNA testing places can glean about you. Check it
out:

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container}

If you enjoyed this video, please subscribe to him. I don't have any
stake in YouTube or Smarter Every Day. But I'm telling you, Destin
breaks things down in a way you can understand.

Enjoy!
