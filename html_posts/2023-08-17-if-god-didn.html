I have an even better one for you.

**How do you know that God (through the Holy Spirit) used Mary's DNA?**

Did you do a DNA test on Mary and Jesus? Or did you just *assume* that
since Mary was the mother that she provided the DNA?

*What if the Holy Spirit implanted a fully-formed zygote into Mary's
womb?*

How do you know?

The simple fact is, you don't. And neither do I. But feel free to ask
Jesus and Mary when you get there.
