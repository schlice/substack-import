Because YouTube is a private company, and they can set ***whatever rules
they want*** for who can use their service.

They can be just as as arbitrary and capricious as they so choose.

They can't, of course, violate anti-discrimination laws, so they can't
ban you because you're a man (or a woman), and they can't ban you
because you're a Catholic or a Jew, and the can't ban you because you're
black or white, and they can't ban you because you're originally from
Germany or Scotland or Japan, and the can't ban you because you're over
60.

Beyond that, they can create whatever rules they want to "protect their
community" from whatever perceived anything they want to protect their
community from.

That's what it means to be a private company.
