**What more can Londoners do to prevent knife crime? Are there solutions
that the government and citizens have left unexplored?**

There are two issues in your question. The first issue is the reduction
of knife crime in general, and the second issue is your personal safety.
I'm not sure which question you're asking: whether you're asking how you
reduce crime, or how you prevent yourself from becoming a victim. I will
only address the first question: how to reduce knife crime in general.
If you want an answer to the second, please ask another question, but
more succinctly.

The implement used is solely related to your society and its norms. To
that end, the fact that criminals use knives instead of guns or cricket
bats or bags of rocks is irrelevant. Therefore, in order to prevent
knife crime, you have to ignore the tool, and focus on the act. I know
it's hard to do, because a knife is a tangible thing, and crime and its
causes are so nebulous, but you must focus on the crime and not the
implement of the crime.

Therefore, in order to prevent knife crime, you have to prevent *crime*.
To do that, you have to find the reasons why people commit crime in the
first place. It may be wealth inequality. It may be hunger. It may be
anger. Until you get to the root cause of *crime*, you're not going to
be able to stop any crime, let alone knife crime.
