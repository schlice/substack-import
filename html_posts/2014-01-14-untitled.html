<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [You are welcome, and from the sound of it, a full neuro<br>exam sounds ideal. Neuro exam signs that would indicate lesions on the<br>corticospinal tract include the Babinski Sign and the Hoffmann Sign.<br>Additional indicators of lesions in the upper spine include the<br>l'Hermittes phenomenon and (as you are already aware) the Romberg Sign.<br>Any of these combined with the more common spinal MS symptoms (bowel,<br>bladder, or sexual dysfunction) are a fair indicator that corticospinal<br>tract lesions may be present. Don\'t forget about Transverse Myelitis as<br>a possibility here; often, spinal MS is initially misdiagnosed as such,<br>but only because of their close relationship and because MS is a<br>diagnosis of exclusion, all the more likely players come out first.\<br>\<br>Good luck; I am happy to answer whatever other questions you may<br>have.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Multiple-Sclerosis-If-I-have-a-normal-brain-MRI-what-is-the-likelihood-it-could-be-spinal-in-nature/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
