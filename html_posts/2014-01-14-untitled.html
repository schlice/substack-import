<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [You are welcome, and from the sound of it, a full neuro
exam sounds ideal. Neuro exam signs that would indicate lesions on the
corticospinal tract include the Babinski Sign and the Hoffmann Sign.
Additional indicators of lesions in the upper spine include the
l'Hermittes phenomenon and (as you are already aware) the Romberg Sign.
Any of these combined with the more common spinal MS symptoms (bowel,
bladder, or sexual dysfunction) are a fair indicator that corticospinal
tract lesions may be present. Don\'t forget about Transverse Myelitis as
a possibility here; often, spinal MS is initially misdiagnosed as such,
but only because of their close relationship and because MS is a
diagnosis of exclusion, all the more likely players come out first.\

Good luck; I am happy to answer whatever other questions you may
have.]{.rendered_qtext}
