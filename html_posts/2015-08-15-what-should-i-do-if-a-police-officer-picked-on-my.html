**Content:** [1. Using force against a police officer, ever, is an
aggravated felony, regardless of why you did it. Your bravado and the
sense that you\'re defending your girlfriend\'s honor by physically
attacking a police officer will absolutely, without any shadow of a
doubt, land you in jail for at least a year, and will cost you a pretty
penny as well. **Never, never use force against a police officer.** The
person who recently pistol-whipped the detective will be going to jail
for a long time. Facebook may have applauded him, but the judge won\'t
be so kind.\
\
2. If your girlfriend doesn\'t respect you because you failed to assault
a police officer, kick her to the curb. Quick.\
\
3. If police officers can create such an airtight case against you by
planting evidence and fabricating all the evidence needed to convict you
in court, there\'s not a darn thing you can do about it. You\'re just
screwed. Maybe trying to pay for better lawyers might help, but I highly
doubt it.\
\
4. If the police harass you, follow the normal guidelines we provide for
dealing with police officers: do what they tell you at the scene, then
file written complaints against the officer with their commander or with
Internal Affairs if their department has one. If you can, retain an
attorney and sue the department.]{.rendered_qtext}
