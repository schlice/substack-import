**What happens if a cop rear ends you?**

Is this like one of those jokes? "What happens when you throw a white
rock into the Red Sea?" "It gets wet."

So what happens if a cop rear ends you? Your car gets damaged. Then
insurances will fix the cars they cover. Then life goes on.

Pretty much like any other traffic accident.
