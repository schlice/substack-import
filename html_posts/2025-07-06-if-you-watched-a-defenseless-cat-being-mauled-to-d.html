First of all, under United States law, pets are not people, they are
property. If one house caught another house on fire and you didn't grab
a garden hose, do you get saddled with the cost to rebuild the house?

As sad as it sounds when you talk about pets (because everyone loves
their pets), that's the truth.

Second, there is no duty to protect in US law.

Let's get away from cats and dogs for a second and get to a place where
we at least have a general idea about when we should help. Let's say you
came upon a bad guy mercilessly beating a little girl, and you took out
your phone and recorded the whole thing, including right up to the point
where the little girl actually died. Would you be responsible for the
little girl's death because you failed to stop it?

No, you would not. Again, there is no "duty to protect" in the United
States. You cannot be held responsible for failing to act (certain very
specific instances notwithstanding). If you simply stand on the
sidelines and do nothing, you did not contribute to the death, so you
are not responsible for the death.
