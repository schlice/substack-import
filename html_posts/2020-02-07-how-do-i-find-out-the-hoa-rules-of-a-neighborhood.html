**How do I find out the HOA rules of a neighborhood before finding a
house?**

If you're just investigating neighborhoods and not actually buying yet,
the easiest way is to have your Realtor get them for you. Just tell your
Realtor the neighborhood and they can acquire the Covenants and the
Rules for your review. Even if you're not ready to move on a house, it's
still a good idea to be represented by a local Realtor.

Many HOAs post their Governing Documents online, as most HOAs have some
form of web presence by this point in time. You may be able to find the
documents with a simple search for the neighborhood.
