Let's answer each of your questions, since you asked two:

**If people want to be able to shoot automatic weapons for sport, why
can\'t we have secure, guarded shooting ranges where they could be
rented instead?**

Yes. We have these. There are several that I know of, all over the
country.

**Couldn't that work as a reasonable compromise between an outright ban
and unfettered, private ownership?**

We already have an appropriate "reasonable compromise" which has worked
very well for automatic weapons. You need a Type 1 Federal Firearms
License, a \$200 tax stamp, and you can't buy or register any automatic
weapon which has been manufactured since 1983, so the entire prospect is
really, really expensive. Only collectors own automatic weapons, and
only one has ever been used in a crime since these laws were put in
place. So I'd say that this is a reasonable compromise. I don't think we
need any new compromises on automatic weapons.
