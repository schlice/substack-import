Recognize that you are not there to *perform*. At least for the
congregation.

**You perform for an audience of one.**

The best church musicians lead the congregation to worship and *enhance*
their worship. They don't stand out on their own. Their gifts and
talents glorify God.

The best church musicians are the ones who display a heart of worship
for the congregation to mirror. They don't stand out on their own.

I can see whether or not I'm successful in that endeavor when I watch
the congregation during a set. Their level of engagement and energy is a
direct reflection of yours.

Well, actually that's not completely accurate. It's said in worship
music that an engaged congregation will only be about 80% of your
energy. So you really have to be energetic and on fire to lead your
congregation in fulfilling worship.
