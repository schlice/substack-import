**Should people who get caught the 2nd time being under the influence of
drinking, and drugs, behind the wheel of a vehicle, be banned from
driving for 20 years, and have to take the bus, train, or walk?'**

State laws are pretty good, albeit somewhat lenient, when it comes to
license revocation. There's a [[pretty good
website](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=262c2e&url=https://www.dui-usa.drinkdriving.org/dui_dwi_state_laws.php){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="drinkdriving.org"}]{.qlink_container} which summarizes all
the penalties, by state, for DUI charges. There's also fines and jail
time, which similarly all vary by state.

If states think it's a problem, states can crack down harder. Even in
Nanny-State New York, you have to hit your fifth DWI before your license
is permanently revoked. California's rules are surprisingly lighter than
New York's, with only the fourth and subsequent DUIs even being
felonies, but if you get three or more DUIs within 10 years, you're
eligible for a 10 year revocation.

Ultimately though, if states think DUI is a problem, states can change
the penalties.
