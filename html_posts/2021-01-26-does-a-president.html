**Does a president's pardon after being impeached count if convicted?**

Yes. The president's pardon power is absolute, and defined in the
Constitution.

Impeachment is a remedy to remove a federal official from office after
he has committed "high crimes and misdemeanors." It is a political
remedy, not a criminal one.

An impeached president is still president. It is up to the Senate to
remove the president from office, and optionally vote to deny that
president the ability to ever hold public office again. None of that
reverses any previous decisions the president lawfully made while
president.
