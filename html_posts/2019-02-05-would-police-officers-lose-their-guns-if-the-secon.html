**Would police officers lose their guns if the Second Amendment gets
repealed?**

Let's first start with what the Second Amendment is, and what it is not.

We all know (or should know by now) that the Second Amendment, and the
Bill of Rights as a whole, does not *grant* rights. The Second Amendment
***prevents the government from infringing on already-existing rights,
rights which pre-date the Constitution.***

So think about this: *if you repeal the Second Amendment, does the right
go away?*

Even if you did repeal the Second Amendment, and a state tried to pass a
law barring civilian ownership of firearms, that law could *still* be
challenged based on the fact that it violates the natural right of the
citizen to self-defense.

(I'll be honest: if national public opinion were so skewed that the
Second Amendment were able to be repealed, then it's also probably
unlikely that such a challenge to such a law would succeed either,
because at that point, people would think *so little* of their natural
right to self-defense that they would be fine with the state infringing
on that right.)

But back to the question.

Let's say that the Second Amendment were repealed. All this does is
remove the protection against the government making laws with respect to
the right of the people to keep and bear arms. This means that it would
no longer be *unconstitutional* for the government to make a law barring
the people from keeping and bearing arms. That's it.

They could make a law which says that civilians who are not law
enforcement officers cannot keep and bear arms. They could make a law
that says that civilians who are not active military members cannot keep
and bear arms. They could make a law that says that only blonde-haired
people cannot keep and bear arms. They could make *any* law about
possession of firearms that they choose, because it would no longer be
*unconstitutional* for them to do so.
