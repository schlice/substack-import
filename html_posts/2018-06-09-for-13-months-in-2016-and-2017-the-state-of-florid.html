**For 13 months in 2016 and 2017 the State of Florida neglected to do
Federal background checks on concealed carry applicants. Shouldn\'t
Florida be heavily fined and the permits, all 275,000+ of them, be
voided?**

You slightly misread the story.

Not all employees failed to do background checks. Only one employee
failed to do 365 background checks because he couldn't log in. He simply
approved the applications without doing the NICS check.

Once this was discovered, the employee was fired, full background checks
were initiated against the 365 applicants, and this resulted in 291
revocations. There is no evidence to show that crimes were committed
using these concealed weapons because of these erroneous approvals.

So the problem was corrected, the suspect employee was terminated, and
those who were erroneously issued permits (less than 300 people, not
275,000) had their permits revoked. The office has also implemented new
safeguards to ensure that NICS checks are actually performed before the
state issues a CCW permit.

Any time you have a system which involves people, people can fail. This
isn't a failure of the system, it's a failure of people. You simply
can't prevent that. All you can do is root out the bad people and
improve your processes.
