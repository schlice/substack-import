*Usually*, this happens before the flight is boarded. *Usually,* there
are a few open seats on the plane. *Usually,* passengers will take the
deal if they can afford to wait for the next flight. *Usually,*
passengers who are told to de-plane do so without argument (they may be
upset, but not openly defiant).

A lot of *usually*s didn't go as usual this time.
