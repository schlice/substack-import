**Content:** [It should be on your lease, both SLOs (Service Level
Objectives) for emergency and non-emergency repairs. You should also
have a number to contact for both.\
\
For **emergency repairs** (such as a failed water heater), I would hound
the landlord day and night until they got it fixed. I mean phone calls
every 2 hours until a repair person showed up at the location. Get the
landlord to give you a deadline, and when that deadline has passed +1
second, I\'d be back on the phone with them. There is no excuse for a
landlord to not call out an emergency repair within 2 hours after
receiving the call.\
\
For **non-emergency repairs** (such as a failed dishwasher), as long as
the issue is not causing a health or safety issue, the landlord can take
(or not take) as much time as they choose to get it fixed, but as we
said, it should be in your lease. If there are no timeframes specified
in your lease, try to work with the landlord to see when they want to
get it fixed.\
\
You can always document your conversations using postal mail if you
think it\'s going to be a problem. In other words, follow up your phone
calls with a certified return-receipt letter indicating that you had a
phone call on x day at x time and this is what you talked
about.]{.rendered_qtext}
