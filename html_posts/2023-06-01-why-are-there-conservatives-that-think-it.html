Because political affiliation says nothing about whether or not you're a
Christ-like person.

You, dear questioner, have conflated "conservatism" with "Christianity."
While it's true that most Christians are conservative, it does not work
the other way round. Most Christians are conservative because
Christianity comports nicely with conservatism: most of the values held
by conservatives mirror the values held by Christians.

However, you don't have to be Christian to be conservative. To wit:

Ben Shapiro. Conservative, and a Jew.

Christianity does not hold a lock on conservatism.

Some conservatives are assholes as people (I'm not talking about Mr.
Shapiro, who happens to treat people as they deserve to be treated, even
though he is not Christian). Some (other) conservatives treat people
like shit. But they're still conservative when it comes to things like
defense spending, fiscal policy, social programs, etc.

Being conservative doesn't mean you're automatically a nice person.
