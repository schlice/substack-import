Because they also "harass" your neighbors when ***they*** do something
***you*** don't like. And that's sometimes worth the occasional
"harassment" you may receive from the HOA.

So follow the rules, and let the HOA "harass" your neighbors so that the
value of your unit remains as high as possible.
