There is no standard behind the moniker "Smart TV." It's not like that
implies some sort of standard feature set or standard build. It simply
means the TV has an application framework built in, probably some
default apps, and can connect to a wired or wireless network.

That said, most Smart TVs have apps available which will use your
network to connect to and control your Smart TV. Check the app store for
your brand of TV, and you will likely find that the manufacturer has
provided an app for your brand and model.
