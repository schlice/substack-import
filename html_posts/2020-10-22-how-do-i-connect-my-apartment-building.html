**How do I connect my apartment building\'s front door buzzer to my cell
phone?**

Let me see if I can provide you with an actual answer for your question.

It sounds like you're a tenant in an apartment building, and you have a
locked common front door with a buzzer system. If your buzzer/intercom
system in your apartment building is capable of dialing out to a cell
phone, just give your cell phone number to your landlord, and they will
attach your cell phone to your apartment's buzzer, so if someone buzzes
your apartment you can talk to them and optionally let them in. This may
not have been done because their system is not capable of dialing out to
a mobile phone. If you're not into tinkering with your apartment's
intercom (or you're afraid you'll break it and then be liable for the
repair), you may be out of luck at this point.

If your complex can dial out to a cell phone, there is a service
available called
[[Ringo](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c1274d&url=https://www.useringo.com/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="useringo.com"}]{.qlink_container} which will provide you
with a special Ringo phone number to give to your apartment building.
This will allow you to add up to five access codes for people like
cleaners, dog sitters, etc, so they can let themselves in. If someone
buzzes you and they don't have an access code, it will forward on to you
or up to three cell phones, so you and your roommates can all be
notified. But that's some more advanced stuff and may be more than what
you need.

Another service,
[[Buzzly](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5ba97e&url=https://www.buzzly.co/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="buzzly.co"}]{.qlink_container}, provides even more
flexibility with virtual "key fobs," scheduled entry, and more. It is
slightly more expensive monthly, but the amount of flexibility and
customizability is immense.
