**Should advertisers still support Fox's Tucker Carlson after his
refusal to apologise for his vile comments about women and child rape
victims? Which ones are still doing so, and are they therefore endorsing
his opinions?**

So let me get this straight.

Tucker Carlson says some offensive things ten years ago on a radio show
hosted by *Bubba the Love Sponge* and no one blinked. Because truly, if
anyone tuned in to the *Bubba the Love Sponge* show looking for
intellectual dialogue, they were drunk.

Fast forward to today, and Media Matters

ten year old recordings specifically during a Fox event for advertisers,
specifically trying to target ad sales to Fox, and Carlson is supposed
to apologize? Because of a targeted hit?

Carlson, for his part, admitted to the comments, and said that anyone
who disagrees with him is welcome to come on his show and debate the
topics.

Let's be honest. If you're digging up ten year old comments in order to
be "offended" by them, you are disingenuous. The timing, ***which is
freely admitted***, is opportunistic and is nothing more than a smear
job. Contrived outrage.

He's right to not apologize. The fake outrage crowd doesn't deserve an
apology.

If any advertisers pull out of Carlson's show over this, please be sure
to let us know who they are. I will stop using their products forthwith.
