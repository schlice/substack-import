You're conflating "giving birth" with "being a parent."

You don't have to be a parent if you give birth. You can simply give the
child up for adoption. You can literally give birth and simply tell the
doctor that you don't want the baby and you're gone. It is really that
simple.

The father can do the same. They can give the baby up for adoption.

They don't have to be parents. But killing the baby is not the only
alternative.

Original question:

If men who are against abortion were to hypothetically get a woman
pregnant but didn\'t want to become a father, would they still be
against abortion, or would they father the child?
