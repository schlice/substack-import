Serotonin is synthesized from the amino acid tryptophan. Many foods
contain tryptophan, so the common belief is that by eating foods high in
tryptophan, you can boost your serotonin levels. But is this true?

Serotonin isn't found in foods, but tryptophan is. Foods high in
protein, iron, riboflavin, and vitamin B6 all tend to contain large
amounts of the amino acid. Unfortunately, though, boosting your
serotonin levels isn't as simple as eating a "high tryptophan diet."

The tryptophan you find in food has to compete with other amino acids to
be absorbed into the brain, so it's unlikely to have much of an effect
on your serotonin levels. This differs from tryptophan supplements,
which contain purified tryptophan and do have an effect on serotonin
levels.

There's a reason why foods like mac and cheese and mashed potatoes are
considered "comfort foods," especially when the weather is dreary. While
high-tryptophan foods won't boost serotonin on their own, there is one
possible cheat to this system: **carbs**. *It's possible that eating
foods high in tryptophan with a healthy serving of carbohydrates can
have an effect on your serotonin levels.*

When you eat carbs, more insulin is released into your system. Insulin
promotes the absorption of amino acids into the heart, muscles, and
organs. The tryptophan left behind now makes up a larger portion of the
blood's amino acid "pool," meaning that it's more likely that it will be
absorbed through the brain barrier.

While they can't compete with supplements --- which you should not be
taking without approval from your doctor --- certain foods contain high
amounts of tryptophan. **Your best chance at achieving a serotonin boost
without using supplements is to eat them often, with a serving of
healthy carbohydrates, like rice, oatmeal, or whole-grain
bread**.[\[1\]](#iSRAO){#cite-iSRAO .citation_link}

Foods like eggs, cheese, nuts and seeds, pineapples, tofu, turkey, and
salmon are all high in tryptophan. With a serving of healthy carbs, you
can naturally boost your serotonin level.
