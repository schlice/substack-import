**Content:** [I\'m going to piggyback on Jevan\'s answer and remind you
that owning a car is not regulated, but driving a car is a privilege
granted by the state. Keeping and bearing arms is a right. Rights cannot
be infringed.\
\
I would advise you to ask yourself if there are any other rights in the
Bill of Rights that you would also support \"licensing and registration,
insurance/liability requirements, required safety equipment, etc\" laws
for.\
\
Start with the First Amendment right to freedom of speech. Should you be
\"licensed and registered\" before you exercise your free speech? What
sorts of state-run classes would you be in favor of establishing in
order to license someone to speak freely? Should you need to buy
indemnification insurance before you exercise your free speech? Shall we
prohibit access to any Web site that has a comment section unless you
have a license? Shall we prohibit access to Facebook and Twitter (and
Quora) until your license to speak has been added to your profile?\
\
What would the penalties be for violating the free speech licensing
requirements? Shall we cut your tongue out (to use the
politically-correct terminology of the day: surgically remove your
tongue)?\
\
If this sounds a little bit far-fetched to you, it\'s because you would
never think about restricting free speech with laws. Similarly, gun
rights advocates do not think of restricting a right with laws. We
understand that there are responsibilities to being a gun owner, and
those responsibilities can be codified in law, but the laws must make
sense and must further a responsibility of being a lawful gun
owner.]{.rendered_qtext}
