You're probably better off asking our friends at PolitiFact about this
rather than us, but I can use The Googles just as well as anyone:

So as you can see, the Act, which she voted for, authorized a "physical,
reinforced barrier between the U.S. and Mexico," and also called for
"strict control of illegal immigrants."
