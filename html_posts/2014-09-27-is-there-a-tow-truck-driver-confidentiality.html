<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [There is no tow truck driver confidentiality. But unless<br>you had weapons of mass destruction in your car, why would a tow truck<br>driver report you to anyone? It\'s just as likely that he had similar<br>things in his own car.\<br>\<br>Also, a tow truck driver does not need to enter your car to tow it. If<br>your e-brake is on, they can flatbed it.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
