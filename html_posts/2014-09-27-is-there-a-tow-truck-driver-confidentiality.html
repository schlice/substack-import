**Content:** [There is no tow truck driver confidentiality. But unless
you had weapons of mass destruction in your car, why would a tow truck
driver report you to anyone? It\'s just as likely that he had similar
things in his own car.\
\
Also, a tow truck driver does not need to enter your car to tow it. If
your e-brake is on, they can flatbed it.]{.rendered_qtext}
