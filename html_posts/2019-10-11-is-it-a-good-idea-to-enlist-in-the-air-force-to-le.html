**Is it a good idea to enlist in the Air Force to learn how to fly? I
want to be a pilot as my career, but I know it's very expensive.**

If you want to be a pilot in the Air Force, enlisting will likely not
get you there.

I say *not likely* because while it is *possible,* it is one of the most
difficult paths in the Air Force to navigate. I personally know people
who were prior enlisted and made it into the Air Force Academy and went
on to become Air Force pilots. It is hard, but it is possible.

If your goal is to be an Air Force pilot, there are ways to do it that
have a higher degree of likelihood than enlistment.

The biggest thing you can do: **go to college**. The reason: **only Air
Force officers are pilots. And only college graduates can become Air
Force officers.**

Going to college gives you a chance to become an Air Force officer and
go to pilot training. Once you are an Air Force officer, you can get
into pilot training.

The big hurdle when you are enlisted is *becoming an officer*, not
*going to pilot training.*

If you can set yourself on the path of Air Force **officer** rather than
Air Force **enlisted member**, you will have a much higher chance of
becoming a pilot.
