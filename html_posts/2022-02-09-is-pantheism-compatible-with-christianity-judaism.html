Pantheism is not compatible with any of these other religions, as they
are all *theistic religions*. Pantheism, as the name impllies, is a
*pantheistic* religion.

Most of the world's major religions fall into one of three main
categories: theism, pantheism, and atheism.

**Theism** is the belief that a personal God created the universe, but
is not part of the universe. Think about the analogy of a painter and
his painting. Theism would believe that God is the painter and the
universe is the painting. Christianity, Judaism, Islam, and Baha'i are
all theistic religions.

**Pantheism** is the belief that there is an impersonal god who
literally *is* the universe. So in our painting example, rather than
making the painting, Pantheists believe God *is* the painting. In fact,
Pantheists believe God is *everything*. God is the sky. God is a tree.
God is the air. God is you, God is me, etc. Most Eastern religions
(Hinduism, some forms of Buddhism) and many "New Age" religions are
pantheistic.

Finally, **Atheism** does not believe in any form of god. To keep the
painting example, atheists believe that the painting simply always
existed, and no one created it. Religious humanists fall into this
category.

Here's an easy way to remember the three religious worldviews:

- Theism: God *created* all
- Pantheism: God *is* all
- Atheism: *No* God at all.

**TL;DR:** To answer your question, Pantheism is not compatible with any
of the religions you listed, as they are all theistic religions which
believe in a personal God who created the universe but is not part of
the universe, while pantheism believes that God *is* the universe. Feel
free to read their books, but the religions are fundamentally
incompatible.

To answer the last part of your question, Abrahamism is another name for
monotheistic religions which believe in the God of Abraham, such as
every one you listed.

Original question:

Is Pantheism compatible with Christianity, Judaism, Islam, or Bahá'í? I
am a Pantheist, but I want to read the Bible, Tanakh, and Quran. Are
Pantheism and Abrahamism compatible?
