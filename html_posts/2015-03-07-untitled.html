**Content:** [I think what you feel is what I like to call
\"depression\" in myself. I completely agree; there is no one else who
knows what we are feeling inside, beyond other people with MS. That\'s
why I think connection between MSers is so important. Your analogy about
the baby is almost correct, except that nearly every woman can actually
have a baby, where not quite as many will have MS.\
\
My \"fear\" is that I will not be able to do the things I want to do in
life before I\'m no longer able to do them. I want to cram them all in
now, while I have the ability. I don\'t know how to shake that. I don\'t
even know if I \"should\" shake that. I\'ve never actually admitted that
before. I\'m told that I should leave it in God\'s hands, but what does
that mean? Does that mean I should throw my hands up and say \"Qué será
será\"? Don\'t try to make anything happen, just let the chips fall
where they may and assume that it\'s God\'s hand that determines whether
or not things will happen?\
\
For example, let\'s say I want to learn to SCUBA dive while I can still
swim. Shouldn\'t I try to plan to learn to dive sooner rather than
later, knowing that I may not be able to do it if I leave it to \"divine
providence\"? I don\'t think that God gives us free will and then wants
us to leave all the decision making up to Him.\
\
So that\'s my struggle.]{.rendered_qtext}
