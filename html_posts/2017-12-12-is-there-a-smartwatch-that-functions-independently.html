**Is there a smartwatch that functions independently as a cell phone?**

Yes, there are many smartwatches which function independently of a
mobile phone. When you're shopping for a smartwatch, look for keywords
like "4G" or "LTE" or "SIM card" support. These indicate models of
smartwatch which support standalone cellular operation, separate from
other connectivity methods such as Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. This is an
example of a [[Samsung Gear
S3](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d8c1de&url=https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Gear-Frontier-Smartwatch-SM-R765A){.external_link

4G, which means it has a cellular radio.

**Could this be used without a monthly cell phone bill payment solely
for the purpose of calling 911 in case of emergencies?**

The smartwatch can physically be used in lieu of a smartphone. There are
a few caveats, however.

- **The Carrier.** The trick is getting a cellular carrier to give you a
  "smartwatch-only" plan. Usually, smartwatch support is an "add-on" to
  an existing cellular contract, so getting a smartwatch-only plan may
  take some doing. You will likely have to shop around to find this.
- **The Battery**. On a good day, the battery on a smartwatch will last
  you the whole day before it needs to be recharged. With smart battery
  management, it will last you a day and a half. But that's all *without
  cellular support*. Add in a cellular radio and your battery life drops
  dramatically. You may not even make it through the day with the
  cellular radio on all the time, and without a connected smartphone,
  the smartwatch with no radios on is just a watch.
- **The Sound Quality.** The smartwatch would be good for a quick call
  or an emergency call, but using it as your primary phone may not be
  wonderful, as sound quality on both ends may not be stellar.

I also don't think any carriers have "prepaid" smartwatch plans which
only have minutes you buy and use when you need them (as in the case of
emergencies). I'm reasonably sure most carriers only support "postpaid"
plans for smartwatches and other accessories.
