<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [Actually, it doesn\'t. The Constitution is a document
which places limits on the Federal government, not the states. The 10th
Amendment says that any rights not expressly granted to the Federal
government belong to the states, or to the people. It\'s clear that the
Constitution and its Amendments were intended to bind the Federal
government, not the states. Also, ratification by a state does not mean
that the state is instantly bound by the Amendment; it simply means that
the state agrees to make the Amendment part of the US Constitution.
There is no effect on a State Constitution when a State ratifies an
amendment to the US Constitution, unless that amendment invalidates part
of that state\'s Constitution.\
\
The Supreme Court spent a great deal of time wrestling with this
argument. People like Hugo Black wanted \"mechanical incorporation\" of
all of the Bill of Rights (1 thru 8) into State law. Others, like Felix
Frankfurter, thought that incorporation should be gradual, but only
because of due process. He said, \"It is possible that some of the
personal rights safeguarded by the first eight Amendments against
National action may also be safeguarded against state action, because a
denial of them would be a denial of due process of law. If this is so,
it is not because those rights are enumerated in the first eight
Amendments, but because they are of such a nature that they are included
in the conception of due process of law.\" (Twining v New Jersey, 1908)
What he was saying is that the rights are protected because of due
process (which can change over time), not because they were listed in
the Bill of Rights (which does not change). For example, in Palko v
Connecticut (1937), the majority ruled that the 5th Amendment protection
against double jeopardy did not violate due process, and so therefore
didn\'t apply to the states. This was overturned on appeal. It went this
way for several Amendments (didn\'t violate due process so didn\'t apply
to the states, but then later overturned). So while the Bill of Rights
was never \"mechanically incorporated\" to the States, over time and
through case law, all 8 of the individual rights amendments were bound
against the states. There are some exceptions, but for the most part,
they are binding.]{.rendered_qtext}
