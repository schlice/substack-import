**Content:** [Yes, the device would be effective at defeating license
plate cameras. However, it would only work on cameras with flashes (not
all of them have them, some have IR lights) and it is most certainly
illegal. In almost all states, anything that obscures your license plate
in any way from cameras is illegal. It doesn\'t matter how the plate is
obscured. In some cases, some laws may not specify that lights can\'t be
used in this way, so it may be technically legal in some states.\

In nearly all cases, the only use for this is to defeat red light
