As fast as you can pull the trigger. Each weapon has its own "cyclic
rate" which is the fastest that the weapon can conceivably fire,
assuming you could actually move your finger that fast.

This is what makes bump stocks so effective. You're actually pulling the
trigger each time you shoot. A bump stock doesn't mechanically change
the weapon. It doesn't convert the weapon to full auto, although the
effect is that the weapon fires at a rate close to the cyclic rate of
the firearm.

In order for the weapon to be considered automatic, you have to get more
than one shot from each trigger pull. In the case of the bump stock, you
get one round per pull, but you're pulling the trigger really fast. So
technically, it's not illegal.
