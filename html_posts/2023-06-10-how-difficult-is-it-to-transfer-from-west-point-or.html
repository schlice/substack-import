I imagine it's pretty incredibly difficult, because I have never heard
of it being done, or possibly in extraordinarily exceptional
circumstances (like pro athletes or something). Entrance into a service
academy is not at all like acceptance into a university. Not only do you
have to be accepted, you also need to be nominated by a Congressman, a
Senator, or the President or Vice President. Those nominations
themselves are not easy to get. In other words, you work 100 times
harder to get in to a service academy than you do to get into a
university, which implies that you're pretty committed to your choice.

That said, there are some folks who, after attending their service
academy, decide that a career in another branch of the service would be
more appropriate for them. Maybe (like one guy in my class) he always
wanted to be a Marine but his Congressman didn't have any USNA slots, so
he came to USAFA, but man, he was a Marine.

What you can do in that case is called **cross-commissioning**. At
graduation, you accept a commission in another branch of service. When I
graduated, we had about ten folks accept commissions in other branches
of service, mostly from Air Force to Navy (Marines). Some went to Army.
We generally have just as many cross-commissioning into the Air Force
from other service academies.

Now, cross-commissioning is not guaranteed. The needs of the service
come first, and there must be an available commission in the gaining
service. But every year, somewhere around 1% of graduates will accept a
commission in another service.
