**Content:** [If you are facing a red arrow, you cannot turn left at
all.\
\
Most states (38 of them, in fact) allow you to turn left onto a one-way
street from a red light, assuming you come to a full stop (same rules as
when turning right on red) AND you are currently on a one-way street.\
\
Five states allow you to turn left onto a one-way street, even if you
are on a two-way street.\
\
The remainder (with a couple of local exceptions) don\'t allow any left
turns on red at all.\
