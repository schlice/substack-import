I got into a disagreement with [[Collin
Campbell](https://www.quora.com/profile/Collin-Campbell-20)]{.qlink_container}
about this very topic on [[the War Elephant
Discord](https://warelephant.quora.com/The-Discord-is-Live)]{.qlink_container}.
I was very forceful in my argument, and I was, in fact, a big fat jerk.
Collin, again, I apologize. I still feel bad about that exchange.

I do, however, want to address the meat of my argument. How Christian is
Mormonism?

First, we must define our terms. What does it mean to be "Christian?"
More importantly, who's to say? Me? A Mormon? Anyone? Can anyone make a
definition of Christianity and it would stick?

We have to have some universally-accepted standard to define what
Christianity is, and is not. Thankfully, we do. In general, all
Christians believe in the infallibility of the Bible. They all, to a
person, believe that the Bible is the inspired word of God. They also
believe that the Bible never contradicts itself. Therefore, if your
religion has a belief, or a book, or a practice which is not in line
with the teachings of the Bible, then it is right to question whether or
not that belief or book or practice is "Christian."

Mormonism teaches that god is an exalted man from another world who has
a goddess wife who, together, produce spirit children, and that we
ourselves have the potential to become gods of our own worlds. Not only
are none of these beliefs in the Bible, but they are most decidedly
violative of several core tenets of Christianity:

- There is only one God.[\[1\]](#ptnrh){#cite-ptnrh

  .citation_link}[\[3\]](#jVvnV){#cite-jVvnV
  .citation_link}[\[4\]](#HwtmV){#cite-HwtmV .citation_link}
- The Trinity is one God in three persons (this would require a complete
  answer of its own, so I'm not going to provide references on it, but
  there are some really wonderful readings about the Trinity out there).
- Jesus is one member of the Trinity, and He is
  divine.[\[5\]](#ysLzx){#cite-ysLzx
  .citation_link}[\[6\]](#qDCAu){#cite-qDCAu .citation_link}
- Forgiveness of sins is by grace alone. No good works are
  required.[\[7\]](#UFmBg){#cite-UFmBg
  .citation_link}[\[8\]](#lFWjM){#cite-lFWjM .citation_link}
- Jesus physically rose from the dead and was assumed into
  Heaven.[\[9\]](#trgxI){#cite-trgxI
  .citation_link}[\[10\]](#Kyric){#cite-Kyric .citation_link}

Mormonism denies that there is only one God, and also denies that
forgiveness of sins is through grace alone.

Mormonism justifies the Book of Mormon's inconsistency with the Bible by
stating that the Bible is the inspired word of God *insofar as it has
been translated correctly*. That's a convenient excuse, but it is wholly
unsupported by fact.

Here's the facts. The Bible was written primarily by 40 different
authors in three languages (Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek). It took
approximately 1600 years to write, and is internally consistent
throughout.

The Bible is 98% textually pure. Through all the copying of the Biblical
manuscripts of the entire Bible, only 2% has any question about it.
Nothing in all of the ancient writings of the entire world approaches
the accuracy of the Biblical documents. The 2% that is in question does
not affect doctrine. The areas of interest are called *variants*, and
they consist mainly in variations of wording and spelling.

The New Testament (NT) has over 5,000 supporting Greek manuscripts
existing today with another 20,000 manuscripts in other languages. Some
of the manuscript evidence dates to within 100 years of the original
writing. There is less than a 2% textual variation in the NT
manuscripts. Some of the supporting manuscripts of the NT are:

1.  [[John Rylands
    manuscript](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=24e3c6&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rylands_Papyri){.external_link
    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
    qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}, written around A.D.
    130, the oldest existing fragment of the gospel of John.
2.  [[Bodmer Papyrus
    II](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2c5e72&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodmer_Papyri){.external_link
    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
    qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} (A.D. 150-200).
3.  [[Chester Beatty
    Papyri](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6206c5&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester_Beatty_Papyri){.external_link
    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
    qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} (A.D. 200) contains
    major portions of the NT.
4.  [[*Codex
    Vaticanus*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=68392c&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Vaticanus){.external_link
    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
    qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} (A.D. 325-350)
    contains nearly all the Bible.
5.  [[*Codex
    Sinaiticus*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f7e8c1&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Sinaiticus){.external_link
    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
    qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} (A.D. 350) contains
    almost all the NT and over half of the Old Testament (OT).

No work which has been "so poorly translated" has so much supporting
documentation proving that it, and its translations, are textually
consistent.

While I have nothing but love and respect for Mormons, and I mean no
disrespect to their beliefs, they are not Christian, by the Christian's
standard of Christianity: the Bible.
