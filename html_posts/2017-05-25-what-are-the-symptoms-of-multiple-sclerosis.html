I had a good bout of Optic Neuritis which never really fully healed. I
still have trouble with fluorescent lighting, and running causes my
eyesight to go all wonky and I see double vision. I hate running now.

I also have weakness on the entire right side of my body. I frequently
trip over nothing because I haven't raised my foot up enough. I also
frequently drop things from my right hand because my grip isn't as
strong as I think it is. Going up stairs is a fun challenge. If I'm not
actively concentrating on walking, I'll usually trip.

I've been fortunate to be on medication from the very first symptom I
ever had, so I've been able to at least slow down the progression of my
disease. Beyond the symptoms I've described, I seem to have managed to
keep my MS from getting worse.

For now.
