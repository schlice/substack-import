As I mentioned, employers *can* discriminate against felons. They are
*not required* to do so. So while their options for employment are
limited, they are not completely zero. There are also support groups
which exist to help convicted felons get re-integrated into society,
matching them up with organizations who do choose to work with them.

I can\'t speak for the whole of society, I can only tell you what
society as a whole has decided. Society has decided that there are some
things a felon should not be allowed to do, even after being
re-integrated. This is the cost of that felony. If people thought this
was unjust, they would change these laws. Some states have, and some
rights can be restored after a time. I know of at least one state which
restores gun rights after 10 years post-release. Some states restrict
rights for only *violent* felonies.
