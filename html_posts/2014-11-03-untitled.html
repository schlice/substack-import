<h2>Answer Comment</h2>
<div>

**Content:** [I\'m totally thrilled with dash-cam videos. They have
completely changed my life. Especially when people complain about abuse
by police.\
\
One woman complained that I was verbally harrassing her. My sergeant
brought her into an interview room, where she could air her complaint,
which she did, in vivid detail.\
\
Upon her conclusion, my sergeant basically said thanks for your input,
now let\'s check the video for that traffic incident. He proceeded to
pull up the dash-cam video of the traffic stop on the PC in the
interview room, and he played it for her. Not only did her testimony not
match the actual words spoken during the stop, the video showed her
being belligerent and downright rude (he later talked to me about
allowing someone to be so belligerent in the first place). He then
calmly explained that he didn\'t really see any issues with my conduct,
and even offered to burn a DVD with the footage on it for her to take,
so she could use it in her own legal action if she chose to do so, which
she rather impolitely declined before storming out of the interview
room.\
\
I would actually love to see more video being used in law enforcement. I
would love to see body cams on officers. I have nothing to
hide.]{.rendered_qtext}
