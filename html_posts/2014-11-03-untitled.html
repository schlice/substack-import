<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [I\'m totally thrilled with dash-cam videos. They have<br>completely changed my life. Especially when people complain about abuse<br>by police.\<br>\<br>One woman complained that I was verbally harrassing her. My sergeant<br>brought her into an interview room, where she could air her complaint,<br>which she did, in vivid detail.\<br>\<br>Upon her conclusion, my sergeant basically said thanks for your input,<br>now let\'s check the video for that traffic incident. He proceeded to<br>pull up the dash-cam video of the traffic stop on the PC in the<br>interview room, and he played it for her. Not only did her testimony not<br>match the actual words spoken during the stop, the video showed her<br>being belligerent and downright rude (he later talked to me about<br>allowing someone to be so belligerent in the first place). He then<br>calmly explained that he didn\'t really see any issues with my conduct,<br>and even offered to burn a DVD with the footage on it for her to take,<br>so she could use it in her own legal action if she chose to do so, which<br>she rather impolitely declined before storming out of the interview<br>room.\<br>\<br>I would actually love to see more video being used in law enforcement. I<br>would love to see body cams on officers. I have nothing to<br>hide.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Whats-it-like-to-be-a-police-officer-who-sees-a-kid-with-what-looks-like-a-real-gun/answer/Patrick-Sims-3<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
