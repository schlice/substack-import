A state cannot either mandate it or reject it. States cannot condition
access to states, or state services, on the use of a vaccine.

Most states have passed laws which state that **businesses** in that
state cannot require vaccine passports in order to access any places of
public accommodation, or that businesses in that state cannot require
patrons to prove vaccination before accessing the business.

Businesses who want to require vaccines to access their business are
going to run into issues when states mandate that they cannot do that.

In fact, the cruise line industry is running into a significant problem
in that the CDC says that one way for them to sail immediately would be
to require that passengers be fully vaccinated. Florida, with PortMiami
being the largest passenger terminal in the US, and having three of the
top ten passenger terminals in the country, relies on the cruise
industry for jobs and revenue. Florida is one of the states which passed
a law stating that businesses cannot require vaccine passports. Florida
is suing the CDC over the vaccine requirement for the cruise industry,
as it is the only industry that the CDC has singled out, and it
disproportionately affects the state.

Original question:

How will it work with some states banning vaccine passports and others
possibly requiring it when there is a lot of travel every day between
states, work, family, and other things?
