The science we use to determine this answer is called *epidemiology*,
which is the study of disease patterns in groups of people.

The average risk in society of developing MS is 1 in 750. Having a
first-degree relative (parent, sibling, non-identical twin) with MS
increases that risk to anywhere between 1 in 100 to 1 in 40.

But it's not all genetic, though, and you can use the identical twin
scenario to prove it. If one of the twins has MS, the other twin has a 1
in 4 chance of developing MS. If it was all genetic, the other twin
would have a 100% chance of developing MS as they possess the exact same
genome, but because the risk is only 25% among identical twins, we know
that there are other factors involved as well, such as age, sex,
ethnicity, area where you were born and where you lived your childhood,
and an as-of-yet unidentified infectious trigger which starts the
disease process.
