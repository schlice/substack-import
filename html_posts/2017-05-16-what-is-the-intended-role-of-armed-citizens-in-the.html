**Be a good witness.**

Beyond that, armed citizens are armed to defend their own rights. They
are not armed to intercede in the affairs of others.

The reason that I don't advocate stepping in in defense of others is
because this is a very tenuous legal area. No one wants to see anyone
else hurt, but juries hate vigilante justice as much as they hate bad
guys, and sometimes juries fear that they will be condoning vigilantes
if they let you go free.

That said, "defense of others" is an affirmative legal defense, which
means you have to provide evidence to support the defense before the
jury will be allowed to consider it. It is not an immunity from charges.
As others have stated, you will likely be disarmed and arrested if you
intercede. You will then be required to present a defense which has at
its core "defense of others."

Defense of others, as with all laws in the United States, varies greatly
by state. Each state has its own requirements for when defense of others
applies. Especially in "duty to retreat" states, defense of others may
not even be a viable legal defense. In general though, there are three
elements to the affirmative defense of "defense of others:"

- You must believe another person is in imminent danger of death or
  grave bodily harm
- Your belief must be reasonable
- You can only use as much force as a reasonable person would have used
  to stop the threat.

A few states still retain the "alter-ego" rule, which means that they
don't have a "reasonableness" standard. In an "alter-ego" state, you can
only use force if the victim could have used force, and you can only use
as much force as the victim could have used. If you were wrong about how
much force to use, or whether the victim could have used force at all,
your "defense of others" defense vanishes.

Still other states require that a "special relationship" be present
between the victim and the defendant, such as a family member or an
extended family member (i.e. in-laws).

There are even further restrictions on defense of others, primarily the
fact that it can't be used in all circumstances at all times. It's
legally really sketchy.

So I don't advocate doing it. Armed citizens are armed to protect
themselves and their families. Your best bet is to be a good witness.
Record if you can. Otherwise, commit to memory as much as you see. Don't
forget to answer the who/what/when/where/why questions when you're
committing details to memory.
