So it's easier for us to understand in a more modern translation. So
let's look at the passage in ESV:

> As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good, to
> bring it about that many people should be kept alive, as they are
> today.

This verse is at the end of the story of Joseph, when he revealed
himself to his brothers at the Pharaoh's temple. After his brothers sold
him into slavery, and after a very long and tumultuous journey up the
proverbial chain of command, Joseph had been appointed the Pharaoh's
viceroy, readying the nation for the upcoming famine. Joseph's brothers
travelled from Canaan to see the viceroy to get some grain, not
realizing that Joseph (whom they had sold into slavery years before) was
actually the viceroy in question.

Just the verse before, Joseph told them that he was not going to seek
any revenge on them for selling him into slavery, and that he had turned
all vengeance over to God. He then speaks the target verse, proclaiming
that even what they meant for evil, God had turned to good. He doesn't
discount what they did, and that in fact, they meant it for evil. But as
he already said in Genesis 45:5--7, Joseph insists that God's ability to
turn any situation for His good is more powerful than any scheme that
any evil can devise, or any evil that man can foist upon man.

What does this mean for us today? God asks Christians to view our lives
this way.

> And we know that for those who love God all things work together for
> good, for those who are called according to his purpose. --- Romans
> 8:28 ESV

Those "all thing" include those things which were meant for evil against
us. God still uses them for good. Now, God does not promise that evil
will never happen to us. But He does promise that He will always care
for us (cf Romans 8:31) and that nothing can ever separate us from His
love (cf Romans 8:34--38).
