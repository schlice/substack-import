**My neighbor had 5 large cartons filled with pennies. His pickup conked
and hauled pennies to a car dealership and bought a truck, but the
dealership refused to accept the legal tender. Why?**

Most businesses don't have large coin counters expecting people to bring
in pennies as currency.

While pennies are indeed legal tender, Federal law does not compel any
business to accept them. The business can indeed ask you to change the
pennies into larger denomination currency at a nearby bank just as
easily as they can ask you to change a \$100 bill into smaller
denomination bills.
