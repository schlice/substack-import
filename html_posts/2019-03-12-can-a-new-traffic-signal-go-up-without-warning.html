**Can a new traffic signal go up without warning?**

Yes, if that's how your city operates.

Most cities (and states) follow Federal guidelines for when and where to
install traffic signals. The guidelines state what volume of traffic
must be present on the streets before a signal can go up, or
(gruesomely) how many fatal car accidents have to happen at that
intersection before a light can go in.

Funny story, I remember a planning meeting where state money was being
allocated for intersection safety, and the woman said that the only
remaining money was to be slated for intersections where death had
occurred, and one of our city project managers who was investigating
improvements for a particular intersection raised her hand and said, "I
have death!" I am reasonably sure that this sentence, uttered anywhere
else but this meeting, would have been quite strange.

Anyway, those guidelines for intersections are just guidelines. If your
state chooses not to follow those guidelines, then yes, a city can put
up a traffic signal anywhere they choose and any time they have money to
spend.
