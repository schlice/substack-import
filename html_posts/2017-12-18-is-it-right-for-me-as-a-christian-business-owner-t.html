In order to successfully use religion as the reason for denying service,
the service you are performing for the customer would have to directly
contradict a religious belief you hold. For example, if you create
shoes, you must create shoes for gay people, even if your religion does
not believe in gay marriage. If, however, you were creating
one-of-a-kind shoes to celebrate a gay marriage, you might be able to
refuse to perform that particular service.

I struggle to see how you would be using your artistic talents to
celebrate sex outside of a marriage.

Even Scott Phillips, the proprietor of *Masterpiece Cake Shop* in
Lakewood, Colorado, had a very specific restriction: as a Christian, he
would not use his artistic talents to celebrate a gay wedding because
his faith dictated that a wedding is only supposed to be between one man
and one woman. When a gay couple asked him to design a custom wedding
cake for their commitment ceremony, Phillips told them he would sell
them any other cake in the store, but he could not design a custom cake
for their ceremony, because using his talents is a form of artistic
speech which the First Amendment right to practice religion protects.
Note that he was not being homophobic in his business practices; he
would sell them any other product with the exception of one which
utilized his creative talents to celebrate a gay wedding. He would
custom-design a birthday cake, or a Valentine's Day cake, or any other
cake, with the exception of a wedding cake. He also has refused to make
cakes for other occasions which contradict his religious beliefs: he
does not make Halloween cakes (which costs him a ton of money), nor does
he make anti-gay cakes. He once refused to make a cake for a Satanist
group. He clearly does not unfairly single out homosexuals simply
because he discriminates against gays. He clearly has a religious belief
which is not in line with celebrating a gay wedding.

Note that this was an issue because Colorado's anti-discrimination laws
list sexual orientation as a protected class. Not all cities or states
recognize sexual orientation as protected. As a business owner, you
should know what the anti-discrimination laws in your locale are.

While sexual orientation may be a protected class, it is almost certain
that violating ones own religion is not; generally, that is an issue
that they would take up with their God.

In summary, the "thing" you are being asked to do must directly violate
your own religious belief before you could consider refusing to do it on
religious grounds.
