**Could Trump nuke London if he wanted to?**

The correct answer is yes.

While there is a two-person rule when it comes to actually "turning the
key" to launch the missile, preventing one person from being able to
actually target and fire a missile, there is no two-person rule when it
comes to the one person issuing the order.[\[1\]](#KnSVC){#cite-KnSVC

The President, as Commander-in-Chief, has the ***sole*** authority to
issue the order to launch a nuclear strike. And specifically, to answer
the question, the President can indeed order a direct nuclear assault,
even if the United States is not under direct nuclear attack.

There may be mechanisms to slow down, or possibly to stop, the decision
to authorize a nuclear strike, but they are highly classified. There is
more collaboration than you might be aware of when the President decides
to issue an order to the military. The Joint Chiefs of Staff, for
example, always act in an advisory role, and would counsel the President
before he issued that order.

However, the president has ***unilateral*** authority as
Commander-in-Chief to order that nuclear weapons be used for any reason
at any time.[\[2\]](#qKRTc){#cite-qKRTc .citation_link}

This may seem scary. You might even truly believe that this is
incorrect. However, it is not. As you can see in the associated links I
provided, this is a question which has not only been hotly debated over
the years, that debate actually validates this point of view.

The question asked specifically if Trump could nuke London if he wanted
to, and since the ***sole, unilateral decision authority to use nuclear
weapons belongs to the President, the correct answer is yes, he can***.

Will he? Of course not. The UK is our ally, and while Trump is certainly
brash and braggadocios, full of himself and probably quite the pig when
it comes to women, he's not stupid as many have claimed. He most
certainly would not take such an unhinged action.

**But the question didn't ask whether or not he** ***would*. The
question asked whether or not he** ***could*.**

And the answer is yes, he can.
