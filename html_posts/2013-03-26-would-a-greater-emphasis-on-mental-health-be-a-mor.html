**Content:** [You are absolutely correct. The problem we have in this
country is how we treat our mentally ill. Do you know where the three
largest mental institutions in this country are? Riker\'s Island, the LA
County Jail, and the Cook County Jail. The problem is that we treat our
mentally ill as criminals. This is what our state mental programs have
devolved into.\
\
However, controlling the sale and acquisition of guns is not a terrible
thing, either. A gun is something that is specifically designed to kill
people. No other item allowed for distribution to the general public has
this specific use. Therefore, it is right to ensure that only qualified
owners who are not criminals or mentally unstable may actually possess
such a tool.\
\
There are definitely items on both sides of the debate that need to be
addressed. Sensible restrictions on who can possess a firearm are
necessary to protect the citizenry. However, understanding that the law
is only applicable to those who follow it, in order to have an ordered
society, we need to criminalize only the criminal behavior. Our current
laws do nothing to further that goal; they only criminalize law-abiding
citizens\' behaviors. When laws criminalize non-criminal behavior, they
are less likely to be followed by the non-criminal citizenry, making the
laws patently useless. We must have laws that make it unlawful for the
mentally unstable to possess firearms, but we must do so in a way that
is wholly non-invasive and protects the rights of the remainder of
society to keep and bear arms. This is definitely a difficult task,
because of our treatment of the mentally ill in today\'s society. In
order to keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill, we have to do a
better job of identifying, and helping, the mentally
ill.]{.rendered_qtext}
