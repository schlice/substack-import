Aircraft APUs use a bypass air intake to get their inlet air. Since the
APU is usually located in the tail, the intake is going to be ahead of
that somewhere. It is different for each model of aircraft. For example,
on the Boeing 777, the air intake uses a scoop which opens upwards, on
top of the tail. On the Airbus A330, it is a scoop on the underside of
the tail. On the old Boeing 727, the intake was actually inside the
wheel well.
