<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Interesting to note that Fort Hood was the target of two<br>active shooter incidents within just five years (2009 and 2014). And the<br>military contains some of our most highly trained weapons specialists in<br>the world; and yet they are not allowed to defend themselves when on a<br>military base/post, let alone out in public?\<br>\<br>For bases in combat zones, military members are required to carry a<br>loaded weapon with them wherever they go, even on base/post. But<br>stateside? No weapons carry allowed. You are certainly allowed to<br>possess weapons, but they must be stored in the armory.\<br>\<br>Our military members are some of the most highly trained weapons experts<br>on the planet, and we don\'t allow them to defend themselves while they<br>are on base. If they comply with local laws, they can conceal weapons<br>off base as well as any other citizen. But no weapons on base.\<br>\<br>By the way, the active shooter knows this too. He may be mentally<br>unstable and have difficulty with the concept of right and wrong, but he<br>is not stupid. He wants to kill as many people as possible before being<br>killed or killing himself. He\'s already resigned himself to the fact<br>that he\'s not getting out of this situation alive, and he wants to take<br>as many people down with him as possible. Does he do this in a police<br>station? Or a firing range? No, he does this in a school, or on a<br>stateside military base, where no one but the police or security is<br>armed.\<br>\<br>Does anyone else find this concept alarming?]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
