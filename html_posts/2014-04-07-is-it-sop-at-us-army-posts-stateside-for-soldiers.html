**Content:** [Interesting to note that Fort Hood was the target of two
active shooter incidents within just five years (2009 and 2014). And the
military contains some of our most highly trained weapons specialists in
the world; and yet they are not allowed to defend themselves when on a
military base/post, let alone out in public?\
\
For bases in combat zones, military members are required to carry a
loaded weapon with them wherever they go, even on base/post. But
stateside? No weapons carry allowed. You are certainly allowed to
possess weapons, but they must be stored in the armory.\
\
Our military members are some of the most highly trained weapons experts
on the planet, and we don\'t allow them to defend themselves while they
are on base. If they comply with local laws, they can conceal weapons
off base as well as any other citizen. But no weapons on base.\
\
By the way, the active shooter knows this too. He may be mentally
unstable and have difficulty with the concept of right and wrong, but he
is not stupid. He wants to kill as many people as possible before being
killed or killing himself. He\'s already resigned himself to the fact
that he\'s not getting out of this situation alive, and he wants to take
as many people down with him as possible. Does he do this in a police
station? Or a firing range? No, he does this in a school, or on a
stateside military base, where no one but the police or security is
armed.\

Does anyone else find this concept alarming?]{.rendered_qtext}
