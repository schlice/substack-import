**A neighbor\'s dead tree is threatening to damage my property. I\'ve
sent a letter which he ignored. Can I take a lien on his house if he
attempts to sell without addressing the issue?**

Short answer is no. You do not have standing to take a lien since no
damage has yet occurred. And even if you did, you still do not have
standing just because (in tort) he has trespassed and caused damage.
Your claim has to be adjudicated by the court; you do not have a prior
financial interest, nor do you have any financial control over his
property, so you cannot take a lien against his property

You will have a civil claim once the tree falls, but until actual damage
occurs, you have no claim.

Your best bet is to talk to him.

If you've talked to him and gotten nowhere, send a ***certified
letter*** (I know you're only sending a letter next door, but do it
anyway) so that you can prove you sent a letter and he got it. He can
indeed refuse to respond to it, as is his right, but you can prove that
you notified him well in advance of any actual damage.

Then, when damage does occur, you'll have an easier time suing him in
small claims court to recoup your losses.

Beyond that, there is nothing more you can do until actual damage
occurs.

A reputable home inspector will tell him that he has to disclose the
dead tree and its potential to fall as part of the sale of the home, and
a buyer could make him take it down before they accept the house, if
they chose to make that part of the agreement to buy the house.
