First of all, your article conflates the people they interviewed, who
were of many varied faiths, not just Evangelicals, to official
endorsement by the American Council of Evangelicals of Mr. Trump.

This is simply not so.

If you actually read the article and not just the headline, Questioner,
you\'ll find that people of all faiths believe that while Mr. Trump may
not necessarily be a man of God, he is almost universally referred to as
someone who \"means well,\" and can \"get things done.\"

Indeed, while politicians spend entire careers explaining how a vote in
Congress actually \"got something done,\" Trump, for all of his New York
brashness, has actually built things. He\'s built skyscrapers. He\'s
built a thriving organization. And yes, he was born with a silver spoon
in his mouth, and I daresay the characterization, \"he was born on third
base and he thinks he hit a triple\" is accurate. That doesn\'t change
the fact that he has actually achieved the things he\'s set out to
achieve. He said he\'d build a world-class company, and he has done
that. He said he was going to have one of the highest-rated reality
shows on television, and he has done that. For all of his personal
braggadocio, Trump *has actually shown that he can accomplish things.*

And Republican voters look at that, and they then look at the America he
is walking into: people are angry with eight years of failed Obama
policy and unfulfilled promises. They are scared at a steadily weakening
economy, and they are (rightly) afraid that a Syrian refugee will
actually be a terrorist in disguise. They look at Trump and say, here is
a man who may not speak eloquently, but he speaks honestly. He speaks
from the heart. He has a genuine love for America (why else would he
sink all this money from his own coffers into the race?), and most
importantly, out of all of the candidates out there, he has the highest
chance of actually accomplishing what he says he\'s going to do, because
he has a *track record of success.* So when he says he\'s going to build
a wall, why shouldn\'t we believe him? He\'s built skyscrapers. I bet he
can build a wall. When he says he\'s going to fix America\'s trade
deficit, restore the nation\'s economy, and return jobs to America, why
shouldn\'t we believe him? He\'s run an immensely successful business.
No one can doubt that. And based on the track record of some of our past
presidents (ahem Bill Clinton), the fact that a president is a moral,
upstanding Christian doesn\'t seem to be too high on most voters\' lists
of requirements for a president.

Clearly, voters are looking for honesty, and they believe that Trump has
it in spades. He may not be the orator and skilled debater that Lincoln
was, but his heart is in the right place, he has the best interest of
the country at heart, and he has the ability to pull it off.

That\'s why he is so popular right now.
