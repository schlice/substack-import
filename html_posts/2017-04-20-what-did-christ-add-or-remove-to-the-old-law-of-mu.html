It's a logical fallacy to think that Jesus "modified" the old law when,
in Matthew 5:21, he said "You have heard that it was said...But I say to
you...". If we truly believe that Jesus is God, and the Old Testament is
God's inspired word, then Jesus cannot contradict what was written,
because He essentially wrote both. And God is unchanging. In Malachi
3:6, God says, "I am the Lord. I do not change."

What He was doing in that passage was that He was clarifying the old,
incorrect interpretations of those passages. The Pharisees and the
scribes had, in essence, *perverted* the original meaning of those
passages, so He was restoring the true meaning of those passages, not
changing or refuting them.
