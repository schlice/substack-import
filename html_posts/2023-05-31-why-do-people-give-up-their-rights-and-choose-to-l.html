What rights, exactly, am I giving up? The right to paint my house
electric blue? The right to not mow my lawn for six months? The right to
leave my front porch looking like a shithole? The right to have six cars
in my front lawn, only three of them with wheels?

The reason why I choose to live in an HOA is not to control *my*
behavior. I already do that on my own; I don't need an HOA to tell me
how to live. Everything that the HOA would ever tell me, I already do. I
choose to live in a neighborhood with an HOA (and I serve on the Board
of Directors) to make sure that ***my neighbors*** control their own
behavior.

*And why do I care what my neighbors do?*

Because when everyone is forced to keep their houses and properties
looking neat and orderly, ***home values remain as high as possible,
even in a down market.***

So we choose to live in a community with an HOA to ***PROTECT OUR OWN
INVESTMENTS***. It's really that simple.

Plus, there are fringe benefits of living in a community with an HOA.
The HOA coordinates the collection of money to pay for insurance for the
common areas (so if one of my kids gets hurt playing there, someone can
help pay for the medical bills). They also pay for the landscaping in
the common areas and at the entrance monoliths, and the water to keep
those areas pretty. They coordinate community events to foster a sense
of community. They pay for amenities like playgrounds and dog parks, and
even if you don't take advantage of those amenities, they make your
community more attractive to prospective buyers.

I totally understand that some people simply don't like anyone ever
telling them what to do, especially neighbors. I get it. It's your
house. You paid for it. You should be able to do anything you like to
it, and you shouldn't need anyone's permission to do it. But even if you
don't live in a community with an HOA, don't you sometimes have to get
permission to do some things? If you want to put up a tower to create a
HAM Radio base station, doesn't the government in which your house is
located control that? If you want to start farming pigs on your
property, doesn't your local government control that? So it's not that
someone is telling you what you can and cannot do, and what you must get
permission to do before you do it (because you always have that). It's
the **level of control** you object to.

Again, that's just fine. But because I don't live out in the middle of
nowhere, because I choose to live in a neighborhood with 114 other
homes, and because, if I ever decide to sell my house, I want to get the
maximum value from it, I'm going to welcome that HOA ensuring that my
neighbors toe the line, because people won't buy a pretty house in a
shitty neighborhood. And if they do, they won't pay top dollar for it.
