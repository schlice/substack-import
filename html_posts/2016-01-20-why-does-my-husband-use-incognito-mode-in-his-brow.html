Have you seen the start page for Incognito Mode?

:::: ui_qtext_image_outer
::: qtext_image_wrapper
![](images/qimg-574b644af30a3921993c83f5ac75c711){.portrait .qtext_image
.zoomable_in_feed

Not only does Incognito Mode / Private Browsing protect you from
downloading cookies and temporary files onto your system, it also blocks
parts of web pages that track your browsing activity outside of your
browser.

If you\'re security-conscious, and if you don\'t want to be tracked by
anyone while you\'re surfing, Private Browsing / Incognito Mode is a
great way to do it.

Or you can just presume he\'s surfing porn. That might be easier.
