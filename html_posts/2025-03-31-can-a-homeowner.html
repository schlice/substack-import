In the VAST majority of cases, no. But as with all legal answers, this
one is also "it depends."

You'll need to check your Governing Documents, and what you'll usually
find are two clauses which largely negate most claims:

- The ARB is the **sole arbiter** of decisions regarding whether or not
  a proposed change will be approved. It is nothing more than *the
  subjective opinion of the members of the ARB* whether or not a change
  looks good and fits with the overall vibe of the neighborhood that
  they are trying to maintain.
- A similar approval for one neighbor does not guarantee an approval for
  another neighbor.

You *may* be able to claim a pattern of targeted denials if you can show
a pattern in the overall neighborhood with respect to your requests
versus everyone else's requests, but that would be difficult to
substantiate.

Bottom line, if you think you have a claim against your HOA, contact a
real estate attorney in your local area who specializes in HOA law. But
I can tell you from experience that the vast majority of decisions for
which a homeowner believes they have a claim are really not actionable.
