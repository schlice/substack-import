I wrote this blog post about 10 months after I was diagnosed. It's
pretty good. I'll reproduce it for you here, since I had closed my blog
and it effectively died.

\

Dateline: December, 2005. I wake up one morning and rub my eyes only to
realize that I can\'t rub the sleep out of one eye. It\'s still blurry,
and it hurts when I look around. Huh, I think. Sinuses and allergies
must be bad today. Shower doesn\'t help much (in fact, it makes it
worse), and I notice that when I walk into the dark of the closet, I see
what appears to be sparklers (รก la the 4th of July kind) around the
outside of my field of vision in my right eye. I explain all of this to
DW, who immediately freaks out because she\'s real cautious about eyes
(she's had bad eyes since she was a teen). She hears \"sparklers\" and
she thinks \"retinal detachment.\" And I have a trip coming up, like in
a day, which she promptly makes me cancel and sets me up with her
ophthalmologist.

I explain my symptoms to him, and as I start talking, he knows exactly
what\'s wrong. Optic neuritis, a transient condition caused by swelling
of the optic nerve behind the eye. The sparklers and blurry vision are
caused by the degraded electrical signal flowing down the optic nerve,
and the pain is from the swelling. The condition will right itself in a
few weeks to a few months. The more nefarious problem, however, is what
causes it. In about half of the people who present with this condition,
there is no cause at all, and it just passes. In about the other half,
it is caused by MS. To find out, I need to go get an MRI. I was
scheduled for an MRI a few days later, and got a call back from my
doctor the same day (that just can\'t be good). He says that I should
see a neurologist, because the MRI shows all the signs of someone with
MS.

MS is the common abbreviation for Multiple Sclerosis, an autoimmune
disease which, according to the [[National MS
Society](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=201541&url=http://www.nmss.org/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="nmss.org"}]{.qlink_container}, affects almost half a million
people in the United States, and millions more worldwide. It hits women
twice as frequently as men, and usually presents between 20 and 40 years
of age. It is characterized by the immune system attacking the nerve
cells of the central nervous system, and destroying the myelin sheath
surrounding the nerve fibers. These areas of \"demyelination\" are
replaced by hard, scar-like lesions (called scleroses, thus the term
\"Multiple Sclerosis\" meaning \"many scars\"). Symptoms are different
for every person who get it, but they can include motor control issues,
bowel/bladder control problems, vision loss, memory and balance issues,
numbness or loss of feeling in the extremities. Usually, the disease is
characterized by periods of disease worsening (relapses) followed by
longer periods of wellness (remission). Eventually, the disease will get
more progressive, causing more permanent disability.

I spend the next month going through all the emotions that someone in my
position would go through: anger, fear, sadness, depression, grieving
over the loss, etc. When I finally came around, I realized that I was
given this illness for a reason. I don\'t know what it is yet. But I do
know that God doesn\'t give you what you can\'t handle.

Hope this helps a little. Feel free to ask questions.
