**Content:** [The testing, or which tests should be used, isn\'t the
actual problem. Performing mass-\<anything\> wastes time and money. And
it\'s not fair to only target the people who wish to own a gun for
testing, because as I\'ve said many times, people who commit mass
shootings may have a mental disorder, but they\'re not stupid. So if
buying a gun legally will subject them to mental exams wherein their
particular psychosis may be discovered, they\'ll simply buy their guns
illegally, or steal them.\
\
Let\'s just start with the low-hanging fruit.\
\
Since deinstitutionaliztion, the \"bar\" for committing someone to
psychiatric care in this country has been raised far too high. Police in
this country cannot commit someone that they confront who is clearly not
in his/her right mind. That person must be a \"danger to himself or to
others\" before they can then be referred for a \"psych hold.\" This is
often referred to by California\'s law number (5150) for psych holds
(interestingly, Van Halen named one of their albums after this famous
code number as well). However, most people the police encounter who are
mentally ill are not a danger to themselves. They simply can\'t (or
won\'t) do what they need to do to take care of themselves. The police
can do nothing to help them.\
\
Sending such a person for more detailed testing is not allowed because
it violates that person\'s right to make healthcare decisions on their
own. But what if they are so mentally ill that they choose not to care
for themselves? No one can help them. Until they become violent.\
\
If we can help to identify the mentally ill and get them the help they
need *before* they become violent, we could stop many of these issues
before they start.\
\
People knew James Holmes was mentally ill long before he shot up a movie
theater in Aurora. He wasn\'t stupid, however. His mental illness helped
him to come up with a theory: \"life credits.\" He postulated that he
could \"gain\" life credits by \"taking\" the life credits of others (by
killing them). If he got enough life credits before he died, he would be
fine, even if he died. He was very intelligent; he was a pre-med
student. He was just mentally ill. But everyone who knew he was crazy
was enjoined from helping him. They pleaded with him to get help. He was
even seeing a counselor. None of them knew he would actually act on his
thoughts. How exactly do you stop that?]{.rendered_qtext}
