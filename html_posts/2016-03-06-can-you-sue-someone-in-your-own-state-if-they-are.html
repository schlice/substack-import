I would suggest you first talk to eBay Customer Service. Purchases of
business equipment like industrial printers are covered under a separate
eBay insurance group (actually a third party). You should explain the
situation to them; they may be able to mediate the dispute.

If they cannot help you, you should consult with a property loss
attorney in your local area.
