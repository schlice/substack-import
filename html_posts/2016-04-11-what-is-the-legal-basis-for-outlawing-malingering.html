Malingering is a big word which basically means \"calling in sick.\"
This is a practice by which a person fakes an illness in order to
receive some form of \"secondary gain.\"

Faking an illness to avoid work or duty is illegal for any number of
reasons, primarily because you receive pay to not work, and you are
absent from work under false pretenses. This is the basis of a fraud
charge. You are defrauding your employer by feigning illness. Your
employer is paying you to work; you are defrauding your employer for
accepting money for a reason other than being sick.

This is already a crime under the Uniform Code of Military Justice
(UCMJ) in the military. The military has made a substantial investment
in the person\'s training, and the qualities of character and discipline
expected of a military member are not best exemplified by feigning
illness. In the military, you are either at your duty station, on
official orders away from your duty station, or you are at the clinic.
Anywhere else, and you\'re AWOL.

Companies in the United States have solved this problem in multiple
ways:

- Many companies have modified the \"sick day\" and instead called it a
  \"sick/personal day.\" If you truly are sick, you can call in sick
  with no advanced notice. If you simply need to take a day to
  accomplish personal business, you can take a personal day with less
  notice than vacation (usually only a day\'s notice is required to take
  a personal day; managers are required to grant personal days so long
  as essential business functions are covered).
- Other companies have lumped all paid non-work days into one large
  bucket called PTO or \"paid time off.\" A certain number of PTO hours
  are accumulated for each block of time you work, depending on your
  length of tenure with the company. Any time away from work comes out
  of the PTO bucket. Once that bucket is exhausted, any time away from
  work is unpaid. This is a popular option for FTH (full-time hourly)
  employees (hourly employees who make a minimum or guaranteed 40-hours
  a week).
