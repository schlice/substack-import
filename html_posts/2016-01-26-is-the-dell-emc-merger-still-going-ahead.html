Charging ahead full steam. We were notified not too long ago that the
\"shop-around\" period had expired. This was the period of time that
other competing offers were entertained. This period has come and gone,
and no better offers have been received (surprise, surprise). So the
merger is moving on to regulatory review.

The merger is expected to be completed around June of 2016. At that
point, all shares of EMC stock will be sold and the capital returned to
the investors. They will receive roughly \$30 per share, as well as
VMware \"tracking stock\" worth about \$6 per share (approximately 0.111
shares of tracking stock for every share of EMC stock).
