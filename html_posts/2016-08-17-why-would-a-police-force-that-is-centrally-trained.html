Laws which are enforced by police are state-level laws, and police in
the United States work for the state, not the Federal government. The
Federal government does not have the authority to operate a police force
at a state level.

This would be a good idea if we didn't live in a federation of (mostly)
independent states, and instead lived in the United **STATE** of
America. The Federal government has already grown bigger than the
Constitution allowed it to, and the people have accepted it. This
sometimes leads people to believe that states are irrelevant and
everything can be done by the Federal government. If the Constitution is
the law of the land, then this is most definitely not true.

So when you do see a federal police force take over, it's either because
the Constitution has been amended, or it has been so summarily ignored
that you now live in a police state.
