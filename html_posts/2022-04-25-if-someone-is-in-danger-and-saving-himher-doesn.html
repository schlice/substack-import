In the vast majority of cases in the United States, no.

There are very few laws which criminalize *inaction* when it comes to
intervening. For most of US society, there is no *duty to protect* in
the law.

For some professions, there is indeed a duty to intervene, but it is
only for certain professions (i.e. doctors, etc), but for the ordinary
citizen, there is no duty to aid written into the law.

Original question:

If someone is in danger, and saving him/her doesn\'t pose any kind of
danger to you, but still you chose not to help and then he/she died, is
it a crime?
