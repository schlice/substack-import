*I* don't expect to get anyone to believe in Jesus. Jesus does the work
of conversion, *I* don't. I just show people that there is a better way
to live than what the world is offering, *and I bring them to him*. He
does the heavy lifting.

But if you're just looking at his death, you're not looking at the whole
picture. The beauty of the story is that he died, **but was
resurrected**. He turned death from something permanent to something
temporary. Death is nothing more than a transition from this world to
the next. His death *and resurrection* opened the door for us to be
reunited with God, as our sins are paid for, once and for all. Jesus
paid for our sin with his death and resurrection.

The "good news" is the Gospel. Gospel actually means "good news." The
good news is embodied in that Bible reference you sometimes see at
football games: **John 3:16:**

> For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son. that
> whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.

*This* is the good news. Heaven is open to you. It is open to anyone who
confesses their sins, repents, and believes in Jesus' death and
resurrection to pay for that sin.

Original question:

How do you expect to get people to believe in Jesus by burdening them
with the guilt of his death? Where is the \"Good News\" in that?
