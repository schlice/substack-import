Short answer: you can't.

You can't develop patriotism through a "patriotism development plan."
You can't force somebody to be proud of their country to such a degree
that they would be willing to fight and die for that country, to ensure
that the ideals on which it was founded will endure.

What you **can** do is **build a country worthy of the patriotism of its
people.**

You can build a system of government that people will look to and will
want to continue. You can build a system whereby each man is guaranteed
the freedom to live his life in the way in which he sees fit. You can
build in the guarantee that basic, natural rights will never be violated
by the government. You can make a system which has the capability to
change if everyone agrees, but is strong enough to be the timeless
foundation on which the rest of the nation can be built.

Once you've done that, then you ***live out the example***. You fight
and die for that country. You believe *so strongly* that your nation
should endure that you become willing to give your own life in defense
of that way of life.

That heritage of sacrifice shows future generations that there are
enough people who believe that the experiment in your nation should
continue that they would sacrifice themselves to see it happen. And they
begin to feel the same.

And patriotism develops all on its own.

You can't just develop a love of country. It develops on its own when
you have a country worthy of such love.

I want to disambiguate something before the trolls come along looking
for treats. *Patriotism* is different from *nationalism*.

Nationalism is patriotism run amok. Patriotism is vital to national
independence; nationalism is the zealous desire to force that plan on
others. Once you believe that your system is *superior* to others, not
just different, and then you choose to aggressively export that system
whether others want it or not, you have moved from patriotism into
nationalism.

Instead, show others that your system is better by being better, not by
forcing others to adopt what you believe is better. You can still
believe your system is the best, but let others adopt it on their own
because they believe it is better. Forcing others to adopt your system
is toxic and is the underlying cause of imperialism.
