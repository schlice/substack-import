**Content:** [You\'ve asked for specific legal advice, but I will only
give you general contract advice.\
\
You signed a contract. Unless your contract allows the company to
unilaterally modify that contract (which it usually does not), you are
only bound by the terms of your original agreement. Usually, contracts
are worded so they can be amended, but any amendments must be agreed
upon by both parties.\
\
I would hire a contracts attorney and review the terms of your original
agreement. I would ask the recruiter to provide me with copies of any
amended agreements that you may or may not have signed. They should have
copies of the amended agreements you signed. And then I would hold them
to the original agreement, or find them to be in breach of contract and
terminate the agreement, or propose an amendment to your agreement with
terms that you are both amenable to.]{.rendered_qtext}
