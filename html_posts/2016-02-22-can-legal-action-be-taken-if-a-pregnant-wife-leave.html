*Is it kidnapping?*

In the United States, a baby does not gain the privileges associated
with personhood until it is born. The fetus does not have any rights.
Therefore, a pregnant woman cannot be charged with kidnapping since
there is no baby (save for the fetus in her womb) to be kidnapped.

*\[W\]hat legal action can a husband take if the wife is 9 months
pregnant and leaves him only taking her clothes and own money?*

Make sure that you change the locks, cancel any credit cards she may
have, and close any checking accounts she may have access to.

Since you said \"wife,\" I can only assume that the couple was married.
So while she may \"leave the house,\" if she really wants to \"leave,\"
she will need to file for divorce. During the divorce settlement, child
support and visitation arrangements will need to be made. She will want
to do this, because being a single mother is hard, and she will want to
ensure that child support arrangements are made by the court. Alimony
(also called maintenance in some states) is dependent on how long the
couple was married, and several other factors that the court uses to
determine whether or not it will be paid.

Conversely, of course, if the mother requests child support, the father
will request visitation rights. This door swings both ways.
