**Content:** [You answered your own question. The force you use to
defend yourself has to be equal to the force being used against you. If
someone is beating you with a stick from a tree and you shoot them, you
probably used more force than was necessary.\
\
The qualifier though, more than the level of forced used, is \"fear for
your life.\" If someone is beating you with a stick, but it\'s a big
stick and you\'re losing consciousness, bleeding profusely, and you\'re
able to make it to your firearm and discharge a round, killing your
assailant, you can reasonably argue that at the moment you grabbed your
gun, you were in fear for your life. This would be an affirmative
defense against a potential manslaughter charge.]{.rendered_qtext}
