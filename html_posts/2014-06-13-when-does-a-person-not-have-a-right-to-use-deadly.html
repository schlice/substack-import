<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You answered your own question. The force you use to<br>defend yourself has to be equal to the force being used against you. If<br>someone is beating you with a stick from a tree and you shoot them, you<br>probably used more force than was necessary.\<br>\<br>The qualifier though, more than the level of forced used, is \"fear for<br>your life.\" If someone is beating you with a stick, but it\'s a big<br>stick and you\'re losing consciousness, bleeding profusely, and you\'re<br>able to make it to your firearm and discharge a round, killing your<br>assailant, you can reasonably argue that at the moment you grabbed your<br>gun, you were in fear for your life. This would be an affirmative<br>defense against a potential manslaughter charge.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
