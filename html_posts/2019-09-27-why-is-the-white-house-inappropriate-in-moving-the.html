**Why is the White House inappropriate in moving the president's calls
and transcripts with foreign officials to a highly sensitive and
protected computer system? Are they afraid of hacking or not normal
procedures for handling such information?**

Transcripts of phone calls with foreign officials are classified
**because of what happened with Trump's call with Ukraine.**

The White House isn't afraid of revealing any alleged misdeeds; there
are far too many people listening to those high-level phone calls for
any illegal stuff to ever dream of being discussed, and it surprises me
that people think that any world leader would blatantly call out illegal
behavior on a phone line with so many people listening in.

The White House routinely classifies these conversations for two
reasons:

1.  They are more afraid of **leaks** than they are of admissions of
    misdeeds.
2.  They want to assure *the other guy* that the United States will
    protect their conversation. They want to assure the other world
    leaders that they may speak to our president in confidence and not
    have their conversation plastered all over every Internet web site
    in existence. This is why Trump had to get permission from the
    President of Ukraine to release the transcript of their call.
