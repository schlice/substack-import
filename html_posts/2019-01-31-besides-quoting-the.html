**Besides quoting the \"You shouldn\'t have signed the contract if you
don\'t like it\" argument, what is your view on HOA\'s fining residents
monthly, for having round trash cans instead of the square ones they
recently commanded you must buy?**

Unless the HOA is receiving kick-backs from trash can companies for
forcing you to buy certain cans, there must be a reason why that rule
was implemented.

If I had to guess, I'd say it has something to do with your trash
collection. Many locations have trash companies which utilize
specialized trucks which grab cans and lift them up, dumping the trash.
When a non-standard can is present, the worker must exit the truck, dump
the can, and get back in, which makes trash collection less efficient,
and makes the driver later finishing his route, which may cause more
problems downstream.

If the trash company contract requires a certain geometry of can, they
may eventually start fining the HOA for every incorrectly-shaped can
they have to stop and collect.

So your round can may be costing the HOA (and by extension, you) more
money.

Let me give you a real life forinstance. In my neighborhood, we have
single-stream recycling. Some residents were bagging their recycling
before putting it in the collection bin. The trash company was finding
that plastic bags were gumming up the sorting machines, so they told us
absolutely no plastic bags in recycling. The problem got so bad (and
they had to stop production lines so many times) that they told us they
would fine the HOA for every plastic bag they found in our recycling.

So we have a rule: no plastic bags in recycling. We can cite homeowners
and fine them if they continually place plastic bags in recycling.

Seems silly, doesn't it? Getting a fine for having a plastic bag in your
recycling?

But there is a reason.

I'm certain that your HOA has a reason for mandating a certain shape of
can.

You should ask them why.
