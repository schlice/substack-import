**What is called when a police officer encourages you to commit a
crime?**

I'm pretty sure the word you're looking for is **entrapment.**
Entrapment is a legal defense to a crime when a government agent or
government official originated the idea of the crime and encouraged the
accused to engage in it. If the crime was promoted by a private person
who has no connection to the government, it is not entrapment.

The police can use deception to induce people to commit crimes, but it
has to be established that the person was already predisposed to
committing crime in the first place in order to avoid having the offense
be considered entrapment. For example, a police officer can pretend to
be a drug addict to get a drug dealer to sell him drugs, and this would
not be considered entrapment. However, a police officer cannot use
deceptive tactics to induce a person to commit a crime if that person
was not previously willing to commit a crime.
