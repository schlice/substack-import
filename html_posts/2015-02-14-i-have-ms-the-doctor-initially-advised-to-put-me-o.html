**Content:** [Tysabri (natalizumab) has the highest efficacy of any of
the MS drugs, which means it is the most effective medicine we have. It
does have a risk of PML (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy),
but the greatest risk factors for developing PML are:\
]{.rendered_qtext}

- Taking Tysabri in combination with another medication. More than 75%
  of patients who developed PML were also taking another disease
  modifying drug, or still had a previous DMD in their system
- Being JC positive. You can\'t develop PML if you are not JC positive,
  as it is the JC virus being allowed to run amok which causes PML.

Even if you are JC positive, you can still take Tysabri. You do have to
monitor for PML symptoms and see your doctor right away if you
experience any symptoms at all. Doctors have had very good luck treating
PML using plasmapheresis, among other treatments, and catching it
quickly is the number one way to get out of the worst of it with little
damage.\
\
Anyway, there are plenty of good choices for drugs, and your next best
choice is an oral drug called Gilenya. It has a low incidence of side
effects (less than 20% of patients who start Gilenya have to stop
because of side effects), and its efficacy is pretty good, while not as
good as Tysabri.
