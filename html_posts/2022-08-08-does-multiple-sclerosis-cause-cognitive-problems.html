"Cognitive changes" refers to changes to many different functions in the
brain, including your ability to learn and remember information,
organize, plan and problem-solve, focus, maintain and shift attention,
understand and use language, accurately perceive the environment, and
perform calculations.

**More than half of MS patients report some change in cognitive
function.**

Some areas of cognition are more likely than others to be affected by
MS:

> - Information processing (dealing with information gathered by the
>   five senses)
> - Memory (acquiring, retaining and retrieving new information)
> - Attention and concentration (particularly divided attention)
> - Executive functions (planning and prioritizing)
> - Visuospatial functions (visual perception and constructional
>   abilities)
> - Verbal fluency (word-finding)[\[1\]](#ezhAT){#cite-ezhAT

Certain functions including general intellect, long-term memory,
conversational skill and reading comprehension are not likely to change
due to MS.

For most people, the changes in cognitive function are mild and may
involve one or two areas of cognitive functioning. Most cognitive issues
can be *compensated* for, using proven coping strategies which have been
available for many years. Therapy and assistive devices can absolutely
help in this regard. However, cognitive issues are the number one reason
that people with MS face early departure from the workforce.
Additionally, it is only very rarely in MS that cognitive dysfunction
would cause you to be unable to function independently.
