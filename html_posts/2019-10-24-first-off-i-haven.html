Many people receive incorrect diagnoses at first.

MS is a diagnosis of exclusion, because there is no one symptom which
definitively proves you have MS. Every sign and symptom of MS can appear
with other diseases and conditions. Therefore, you must exclude every
other disease which can cause those signs and symptoms. MS is known as
"The Great Imitator" for exactly this reason.

For example, when I got my first MRI, which showed lesions on my brain,
my neurologist performed a "little white spot panel" on my blood, ruling
out a variety of diseases which can cause white spots on an MRI. My MRI
plus my symptoms were enough to diagnose MS.
