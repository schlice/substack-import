We already did. We the people spoke. Loud and clear. We delivered a
***mandate*** to President Trump to make sure that RINOs won't block his
agenda.

If you've been paying attention to his cabinet appointments, the people
he is putting in place will absolutely ensure that RINOs won't block any
of Trump's plans.

So congratulations, you've already done what you needed to do to make
sure that RINOs won't be interfering with good governance.
