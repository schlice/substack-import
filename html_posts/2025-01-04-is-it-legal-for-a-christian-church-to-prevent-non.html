**Yes, the church can prevent non-Christians from entering the
building.**

While anti-discrimination laws apply to businesses, religious gatherings
are specifically exempted from anti-discrimination laws which prevent
discrimination based on "creed" or "religion". You wanted a separation
between church and state, so great, the church won't influence the
government. But that works both ways: the government cannot interfere
with how a religious organization operates.

Additionally, churches are private property, and can control who enters
and who does not, so long as they do not bar entry for *any other
non-religious* *protected reason* (race, color, country of origin, etc).

**Even if the church is using public property**, like a public school on
the weekend, during the time that the church is using the property,
church rules apply, not government rules. Churches can keep
non-Christians out if they so choose.

*But why would they?*

The whole point of church is to get more people to *become* Christian.
Yes, the church also ministers to believers, but they similarly minister
to *unbelievers* as well. Most churches of which I am aware actually
*welcome* those who do not believe. Heck, come on in, have a free donut
and some coffee, listen to some good live music, and hear a message
which, even if you don't believe the Christianity of the message,
probably still has some beneficial themes and points. We encourage
non-believers to come in, ask questions (even the hard ones), and enjoy
our hospitality.

**TL;DR:** They *can*, but they *shouldn't.*
