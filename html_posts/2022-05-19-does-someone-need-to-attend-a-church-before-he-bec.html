So in order to answer this, I suppose we need to define our terms.

- What is a church?
- What is a Christian?

If you are considering a "church" as "a building where Christians gather
periodically to communally worship God," the answer is no, you don't
strictly need to visit a church building in order to become a Christian.

But it's important to note that we've found, especially during COVID, a
church is more than a building. When Jesus told Peter that "upon this
rock I will build my church" (Matthew 16) he wasn't talking about
construction. He was talking about his church as a group of people, also
called an "assembly" or a "congregation." The Greek word *ekklesia* is
the word we use to describe the church, which translates to "a
called-out assembly or congregation." So the upshot of this is that
**"the church" is so much more than a building.**

The catch-phrase we like to use is this: *Don't just go to church, be
the church.* What does this mean? Almost every church meets once a week,
usually on Sunday. So, for one or two hours a week, the people are
*being* the church. But, the people should *be the church* during the
166-167 hours when they aren't together in the building on Sunday. Joel
Hunter, the pastor of Northland Church in Florida, said it best, "the
church happens not so much when we gather, but when we scatter." If you
are "being the church" only on Sunday, then you're missing the concept.
Church doesn't just happen when we are together in a building. Church
primarily happens when we are *away from* the building.

And what it mean to "become a Christian?" What is a Christian? The
answer to that is that a Christian is someone who has accepted the fact
that they are a sinner, believes that Jesus Christ sacrificed his life
as a penal substitution for his sins, and confesses Jesus Christ as his
lord and savior. When you boil down all the trappings, this is the root
of what a Christian is. So the big question: does this series of beliefs
and actions require a special building? Of course not. You can do this
anywhere.

But to *grow* as a Christian is best achieved with *help*. Worshipping
communally with believers is a tremendous help in growing your faith, so
getting plugged in to an actual body of believers is going to be
important to help you grow in your faith.

So the TL;DR: do you need to attend a church before becoming Christian?
No. But don't discount the power of belonging to a church.
