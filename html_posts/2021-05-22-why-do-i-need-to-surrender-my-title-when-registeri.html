You don't always; it depends on the state you are in.

Many states allow you to keep your existing title. Nevada, for example,
allows you to register your vehicle and get a Nevada license plate
without a Nevada-issued title. Florida, on the other hand, requires you
to surrender your old title and pay to get a Florida-issued title before
you can register the vehicle in the state. Some states, like New York,
require a new title when you pay off your car loan, but you can register
your car with an out of state title.

When it is not mandatory to re-title your vehicle, it might be a good
idea anyway. It might make it easier when you go to sell your car.
