**Content:** [If it can be proven that the innocent person specifically
confessed to the crime *in order to impede or delay* the investigation
into the real killer, the confessor can be charged with obstruction.\
\
Obstruction of justice is charged when a person deliberately, or through
omission, impedes the progress of a police investigation. Confessing to
a crime which one did not commit does not rise to the level of
obstruction unless the confession was done intentionally to forestall
the actual investigation into the actual criminal.]{.rendered_qtext}
