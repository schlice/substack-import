**Content:** [Polygamy is divided into several groups: polygyny is the
practice of one man taking more than one wife, polyandry is the practice
of one woman taking more than one husband, and group marriage consists
of multiple men and multiple women all being married.\
\
In most developed countries, polygamy of all forms is illegal. In some
countries, polygamy is allowed in some circumstances. In nearly all of
these cases, polygyny is the only form of polygamy allowed.\
\
Most developed countries consider it a human rights violation to allow
polygamy. The United Nations [[International Covenant on Civil and
Political
Rights](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6ae6b9&url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Civil_and_Political_Rights){.external_link

qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} considers polygamy an
international human rights violation and recommends all member states
outlaw it in all of its forms, even though the document is probably
limited to polygyny, as it speaks mostly of women\'s rights violations.\
\
Polygamy is illegal in all 50 states of the United
States.]{.rendered_qtext}
