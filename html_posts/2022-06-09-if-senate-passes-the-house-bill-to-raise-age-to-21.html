Remember that this is only for commercial purchases of rifles. Military
members are issued rifles by the military to use in combat, so this bill
would not apply to them.

But *logically* and *morally*, the bill makes no sense when you factor
in military members.

Why is it *logical* that a 20 year old is not mature enough to buy a
rifle, but that same person is mature enough to be *issued* a
government-purchased rifle and go off to war to defend the country? The
logic simply doesn't hold.

Really, what this bill says is that *unless you join the military and we
can personally evaluate you, we don't trust that you're mature enough to
own a rifle.* In other words, *because a tiny fraction of people buy
rifles and kill people with them, we will take away the ability of
anyone to purchase a rifle.*

But killers never follow laws anyway. Would this have stopped Sandy
Hook? Nope, because the killer didn't buy the rifle. He broke into the
safe storage, killed his mother, and then went to the school to kill
Kindergarteners. So we stop an even smaller percentage of killers from
legally obtaining a firearm, but in the process we have stopped large
swaths of innocent, law-abiding Americans (who can join the military and
vote) from purchasing rifles themselves.

We keep chipping away at the Second Amendment piece by piece, because we
keep allowing the little corner cases to be restricted. Eventually,
there won't be any corners left to restrict, and we'll be scratching our
heads when the gestapo is knocking on your door demanding you hand over
your scary black rifles because no one wants to address the real issues.

Original question:

If Senate passes the house bill to raise age to 21 for purchases of
semiautomatic rifles, does this also mean the military will only accept
the applications of those 21 and over as the new recruits will have to
await their 21st birthday?
