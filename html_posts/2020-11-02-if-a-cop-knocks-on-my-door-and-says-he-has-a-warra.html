**If a cop knocks on my door and says he has a warrant how can I confirm
he\'s not lying this happened last march he said police I have a warrent
for (my name) I opened the door he then didn\'t have a warrant and
walked in which is trespassing?**

If you can't see out of your front door, you should fix that. Have a
peephole installed, or use a Ring doorbell (or similar video doorbell).

Really, the police can tell you they have a warrant, even if they don't,
and there really isn't a way at the door for you to know. If they called
one in, they may not have the paper warrant in hand, but they may still
have a warrant. In other words, they may not have a piece of paper to
show you in all cases. Some jurisdictions may require it, and if you do
the research, maybe you can find out if a paper warrant is required in
your jurisdiction. If it is, you can demand to see it before you open
your door.

If they do not have a warrant but they said they did, this is an issue
for your lawyer to argue. In essence, assuming you were arrested, it may
have been an unlawful arrest if you were arrested without a warrant and
without probable cause. The police don't need a warrant to arrest you,
but if they don't have a warrant, they have to have probable cause that
you committed a crime. If they don't have either of those, your lawyer
should help you with that.

The other question at issue is the police entering your house uninvited.
There are certain circumstances under which police are allowed to do
this; the primary method by which they can do this is called *exigent
circumstances*. In other words, if the police feel that circumstances
exist in which someone could be hurt, or evidence of a crime could be
destroyed, or a suspect could escape, or some other consequence which
"improperly frustrates legitimate law enforcement efforts," they can
enter without a warrant.

The police are not required to explain any of this to you, either their
lack of a warrant or their entry into your home without permission. They
are only required to explain this to the judge. You are required to
explain exactly what happened, and your lawyer is there to help ensure
that the police followed the law to the letter. If they did not, the
arrest could be thrown out.

If you were not arrested, but you are still concerned that the police
forced their way into your home, you should file a complaint with the
department. It would be a waste of time to try to argue a trespassing
claim.

Just remember: there is never a legal requirement to open your front
door for anyone. If you don't like what the "police" are telling you,
don't open your door. If they have a warrant for your arrest, they're
coming in whether you like it or not. You can always refuse. If there is
a true warrant though, they can break down your door to arrest you and
you would be liable to fix the door. But if they don't have a warrant,
they won't break your door down. If you want to roll the dice, you're
free to do so; replacement cost of a front door notwithstanding.
