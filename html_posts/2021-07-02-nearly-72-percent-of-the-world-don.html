Fascinating. Did you know that there is more, and better, documentation
regarding the existence of the person known as Jesus of Nazareth than
there is regarding the existence of the person called Julius Caesar? Yet
no one doubts that Julius Caesar existed.[\[1\]](#bvLJt){#cite-bvLJt
.citation_link}

I think the source of your data may be misleading you. In 2020, there
were 2.38 billion professed Christians, which accounts for 31% of the
world's population. So from that, you can extrapolate that nearly 72% of
the world's population is not Christian.

However, being "not Christian" doesn't mean that they don't believe
Jesus existed at all. Jesus is mentioned in the
Qur'an[\[2\]](#OruuN){#cite-OruuN .citation_link}, so those who practice
Islam believe Jesus existed, and that's the second largest world
religion, at nearly 25%.

That means that nearly 56% of the world's population believe that, at
the very least, Jesus existed.

And I'm certain that a sizeable portion of the secular/agonstic/atheist
population believes that Jesus actually lived, even though none of them
believe that he rose from the dead. They together account for nearly 16%
of the world's population.

Therefore, it's likely that as many as 72% of the world's population
believes that Jesus, at least, did exist. Unless you are willfully
ignorant, it's unlikely that anyone truly doubts that the person known
as Jesus of Nazareth actually existed.

Skeptics can doubt that he rose from the dead. There will always be
those who doubt that claim. But doubting that he existed at all is
illogical and is not supported by documented historical record.

Original question:

Nearly 72 percent of the world don\'t think Jesus was a real person. Why
is Christianity such a lie?
