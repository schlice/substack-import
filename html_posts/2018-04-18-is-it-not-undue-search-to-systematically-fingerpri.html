**Is it not undue search to systematically fingerprint and photograph
American citizens upon entry to the USA?**

Why would you want to photograph and fingerprint American citizens who
enter the USA? They already have passports (which imply fingerprints)
and photographs in those passports. Sounds like an unnecessary extra
step when the information is already there.

To the legality of the operation (should you decide to waste the money
to do it), it should be legal. The appearance of your face is not
protected information. Your fingerprints are also not PII (Personally
Identifying Information) like your Social Security Number. You willingly
leave your fingerprints everywhere you go, so if they are protected,
you're doing a bad job at protecting them (unless you wear latex gloves
all day which is just weird unless you're a doctor).

But why would you do this to American citizens in Customs while they are
returning to the USA? It simply makes no sense. There's no good reason
to do it when the information is already on file.
