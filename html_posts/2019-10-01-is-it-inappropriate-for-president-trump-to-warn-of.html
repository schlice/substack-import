**Is it inappropriate for President Trump to warn of treason or civil
war when confronted with an official impeachment inquiry by the U.S.
Congress?**

Sure, if that's what he did.

But he didn't.

First of all, he's quoting a guest on Fox News. Second, the quote says
that it would cause a "Civil War-like fracture" not that it would cause
a civil war.

And he's not wrong.

**Democrats** pushed the Mueller probe, and you know how well that
turned out.

**Democrats** forged the whistleblower complaint, even before the
evidence was in. They knew of the complaint for months, they re-tooled
the whistleblower statute to allow it in, and they held on to the
complaint so that they could time its release (and the subsequent push
for impeachment) in the most appropriate way to serve their own ends.

**Democrats** published Articles of Impeachment, *without an impeachment
inquiry.*

**Democrats** will likely be the only ones voting for those articles, if
and when they make it to the floor of the House.

This isn't **Congress** impeaching the President, it's **Democrats**
impeaching the President. Everything they have done has not been for the
good of the **country**, but for the good of the **Democrats**, and at
the expense of the integrity of the Congress, and at the expense of any
non-partisan collaboration. They have done nothing to advance any
meaningful legislation. They are pandering to their base, plain and
simple. And it will ultimately hurt both them and the nation in the long
run.

Ultimately, it will *increase* partisanship rather than *decrease* it.
It will, in the words of Pastor Jeffress, "cause a Civil War-like
fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal."
