Everyone's got the Trump angle covered, so I want to specifically
address the last part of your question:

> **Would you take a bullet to the head for democracy?**

Yes. I even *voluntarily* agreed to do so. I voluntarily agreed, without
any mental reservation or purpose of evasion, to take a bullet to the
head for democracy when I signed on the dotted line and entered military
service in the United States Armed Forces.

Yes, that's what our military does. Yes, that's why you "thank a vet."
You thank a vet because they volunteered to take a bullet to the head
for democracy. Or in more descriptive terms, they volunteered to make
the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our Constitution and our way of
life.

So when you thank a vet for their service (assuming you do), this is
what you're thanking them for.
