  or is it erotic to them? In other words does a flat tummy or a bit of a pooch look
  sexier to men?"'

**Content:** [First of all, this is all individual to each man out
there. Remember the old saying, which is actually true, regardless of
what the fashion industry tells you: \"Beauty is in the eye of the
beholder.\"\
\
For me personally, I like a woman who is happy with herself the way she
is. A woman who is 5\'9\" and is barely 110 lbs and is upset with her
weight is unattractive, whereas a woman who is 5\'6\" and is 135 lbs but
is healthy and happy is far more attractive.\
\
There is far more that could be said regarding this, including some of
the old (albeit crass) adages that guys used to tell themselves
regarding a little fat on a girl, but that\'s not stuff that I would
publicly post. Nonetheless, I have grown up around both types and I\'ve
gotta say that it really appeals to me when a woman believes she is
attractive the way she is. Today\'s media-saturated society doesn\'t
usually allow women to feel comfortable with who they are; it
continually pushes them to be something more, regardless of how they
currently look. Otherwise, the fashion industry would find no repeat
business.]{.rendered_qtext}
