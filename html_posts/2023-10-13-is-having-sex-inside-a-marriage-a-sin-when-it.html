*NOTE: This entire conversation is predicated on the view that the sex
(and the family planning) is happening within the bounds of a healthy
marriage.*

So are you saying that if you are trying to have children and you do
have sex and you don't get pregnant, was your sex sinful? Or is it only
sinful if you have sex and you're not trying to have children? Or you're
not even thinking about children?

Do you believe in contraceptive use? Do you think that Christian
families can use contraceptives? Can they use the rhythm method to
control when they get pregnant? Do you think it is a sin to try to
control when they get pregnant?

These are all related questions, but the answer is that the Bible is
indeed silent about the practices of family planning, in just the same
way that the Bible is silent about cell phones. It just didn't exist at
the time of the Bible's writing.

That said, preventing or controlling pregnancy for family planning
purposes is netural; it is not considered sinful. However, the married
couple must always accept the fact that God's will ***will be done***
whether they agree that it's the right time or not.

> In their hearts humans plan their course, but the LORD establishes
> their steps. --- Proverbs 16:9 NIV

Married couples must accept this possibility. If it is God's will that
they get pregnant, contraceptives will not stop that from happening.

Anyone, but especially married couples, who has sex, with or without
contraception, must be prepared for the possibility of pregnancy.
