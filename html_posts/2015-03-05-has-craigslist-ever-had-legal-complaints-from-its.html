**Content:** [What legal benefits (or legal restrictions) are placed on
a website based on its Top-Level Domain (TLD)?\
\
To the best of my knowledge, the TLD was, at best, a way to classify
websites based on the type of content served there:\
\
.com: Commercial (for-profit) websites\
.org: Not-for profit organizations\
.gov: Government websites (restricted to government only)\
.edu: Educational websites\
.net: Network service providers\
.mil: Military organizations (restricted to military only)\
\
When registration restrictions were lifted in the early 90s, any
organization could apply for registration in any of the TLDs. There are
no legal implications of being registered in any TLD. There are some
restrictions as to who can register for certain TLDs, but for the most
part, anyone can register in any of the TLDs.]{.rendered_qtext}
