**Can apps record you without consent?**

The device (either iOS or Android) must request permissions before it
can start accessing certain hardware features of your phone. On Android,
apps must ask you explicit permission before it uses:

- Camera
- Microphone
- Location
  - While the app is running
    - Precise location
    - Approximate location
  - In the background
- Phone
- Contacts
- Internal device storage
- Control vibration
- Network access
- View Wi-Fi connections
- Receive data from Internet

(Note that these are broad sections of the device that it must ask for;
there are a few more precise functions within these headings that it
must ask for, but they all fall under these headings)

So the application must ask you permission before it uses any of these
parts of your phone.

Once you grant it access, while the app is running, it can use those
features.

**Whether or not it records you in the background without your
knowledge** would be something that is part of its **Privacy Policy**
and its **Terms of Service**. Presumably, you would expect it to be
doing this (i.e. the app is a fitness tracker, so recording your precise
location while the app is running would be expected). The app should not
be doing something unexpected (i.e. you wouldn't expect your fitness
tracker to be accessing your camera). You should understand every
permission you grant to your apps and you should only provide that
access to apps you trust.
