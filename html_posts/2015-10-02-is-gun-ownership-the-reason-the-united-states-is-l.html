**Content:** [*(Because \"gun ownership\" is such a nebulous term and
means a lot of things, including buying black market guns, I will assume
you meant \"legal gun ownership\" when you said \"gun ownership.)*\
\
You claim that the United States is leading the world in mass shootings.
When you actually look at the numbers around the world, and adjust for
variations in population, we\'re definitely up there, but we certainly
don\'t \"lead the world.\"\
\
At 0.15 mass shooting fatalities per 100,000 people, the US had a lower
rate than Norway (1.3 per 100,000), Finland (0.34 per 100,000) and
Switzerland (1.7 per 100,000).\
\
The United States does have a higher *rate of incidents* than other
countries, but when looking at the actual numbers per capita, the US
doesn\'t lead the world.\
\
Legal gun ownership has never been shown to influence mass shootings. In
fact, in the countries in which legal gun ownership has been removed,
shootings still occur. Homicides with guns still occur. Homicides
continue to occur. Suicides still occur, and suicides with guns still
occur.\
\
Removing legal gun ownership removes one avenue that criminals have to
gaining illegal guns: stealing them from legal gun owners. There are
still plenty of other methods for criminals to acquire illegal guns. The
removal of legal gun ownership channels only strengthens the black
market.\
\
We also haven\'t even addressed non-gun related death around the world.
If these were included, we would likely see something much different
statistically, as there have been a number of high-profile terrorist
attacks in Europe that are not included in those numbers because we
focused exclusively on guns.\
\
There is the rub: we tend to ignore the actual issue because we tend to
focus on the gun.]{.rendered_qtext}
