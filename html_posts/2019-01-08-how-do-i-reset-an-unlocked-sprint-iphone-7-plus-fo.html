**How do I reset an unlocked Sprint iPhone 7 Plus for use on a T-Mobile
account?**

1.  If it is truly not SIM-locked, drop the new SIM in.
2.  It would probably be best to call T-Mobile Customer Service and
    ensure they have the new device in the system. They may ask for the
    IMEI number, which you can get by using the Phone app and dialing
    **\*#06#**.
3.  I would also do a full Wipe and Reset on the phone as well, but
    that's just me. It's probably not completely necessary.
