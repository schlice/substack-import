**Content:** [I didn\'t know that there were laws that governed airline
pricing practices. I wasn\'t aware that as a matter of law, a vendor
could not arbitrarily raise or lower prices at will. To his own
detriment, of course, but I wasn\'t aware that there were laws against
being able to set your own prices in your own business.\
\
I\'m being slightly facetious there. A business has every right to
change the prices of whatever it is they are offering at any time. Of
course, if what you say is true, then if your passengers don\'t buy a
ticket on the first site visit (if they actually shop around), you\'ll
end up losing customers as they will then be forced to continue to shop
around to find the cheaper fare.\
\
What\'s more likely happening is that as you approach the actual
time/date of the flight, the price increases, usually automatically
based on pricing algorithms.]{.rendered_qtext}
