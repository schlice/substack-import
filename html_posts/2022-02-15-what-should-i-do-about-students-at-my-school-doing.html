You alone probably aren't going to be able to stop it. So there's really
only two things you can do:

1.  Learn to live with it
2.  Change your school

Under the "learn to live with it" category, find out where the worst
smells come from and avoid those areas.

Under the "change your school" category, it's not as difficult as you
think. There are virtual schools you can attend for free (as they are
public schools) in nearly every state; there's a good chance your state
has one. They're not widely publicized because the government would
never do something actively to drive students to other schools (if you
want to know why, look up Per Pupil Operating Revenue \[PPOR\]). Anyway,
head on over to the [[K12
Website](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8b5513&url=https://www.k12.com/parent-student-resources/how-to-enroll.html?utm_campaign%3Dtickerlink_howtoenrollswitch){.external_link

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="k12.com"}]{.qlink_container} to search for a school where
you live and look into it. I can vouch for K12. It is a great company
and they offer you a solid product.

Original question:

What should I do about students at my school doing weed? I smell it
everywhere and I\'m sick of breathing in it. Everyone at school thinks
it\'s normal, even the teachers.
