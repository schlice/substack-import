**Content:** [Yes, communications between all healthcare professionals
and their patients are covered by \"doctor-patient privilege.\"\
\
The point at which that privilege no longer applies is when the
professional learns that the patient may be a danger to himself or to
others. At this point, the exact opposite becomes the case: the
professional now has a ***professional obligation*** to contact law
enforcement and/or ensure the patient is delivered safely to a hospital
inpatient setting for emergency mental health
intervention.]{.rendered_qtext}
