If the judicial branch declares a law to be unconstitutional, the
legislative branch can re-write the law to either clarify the wording
which made it unconstitutional, or they can exclude the unconstitutional
provisions and pass the law again. Alternatively, they can propose
Constitutional amendments to change a portion of the Constitution used
to rule a law as unconstitutional, or they can propose Constitutional
amendments to overturn a judicial decision. Finally, they approve
federal judge appointments made by the executive.

The executive branch checks the judicial branch by appointing all
federal judges.
