**Content:** [Because so many people *want* to be N, whether or not they
actually are. It\'s because they believe ***one is better than the
other***, which is simply not true.\
\
Your personality type is what it is. I\'m an S. It doesn\'t make me an
ignoramous. It makes me an engineer. And a good one.\
\
My spouse is an N. A solid N.\
\
We work well together because her strengths are my weaknesses, and vice
versa. She relies on me for certain things (mostly technical), and I
rely on her for many others (like being able to \"read\" people, which
she absolutely excels at). I think I\'m getting the better end of the
deal. And I will spend the rest of my life thanking her for
that.]{.rendered_qtext}
