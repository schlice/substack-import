Hi
[[Tyler](https://www.quora.com/profile/Tyler-Rose-46)]{.qlink_container},
thanks for asking.

If you haven't done so already, please take some time to review the
[[Air Force Academy
Admissions](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=60e33c&url=https://www.academyadmissions.com/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="academyadmissions.com"}]{.qlink_container} website. On
there, make sure you check out the [[Extracurricular
Activities](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b8d301&url=https://www.academyadmissions.com/admissions/the-application-process/extracurricular-activities/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="academyadmissions.com"}]{.qlink_container} page, which will
tell you, among other things:

> *Participation in a variety of athletic and non-athletic high school
> activities is an asset in preparing for the demanding Air Force
> Academy program, and is a competitive factor in your application to
> the Academy.*
>
> *Sustained participation and leadership in a few activities is
> desirable.*

Remember, they are looking for **sustained participation in a few
activities.** You don't need to do a hundred activities. You just need
to do a few, consistently, and show leadership in that activity. The
Academy is looking for people with **demonstrated leadership potential**
and **the ability to succeed in a high-stress academic, athletic, and
military environment.** Showing high academic achievement as well as
sustained participation and leadership in a few extracurricular
activities will achieve that goal.

Also, if you have not reached out to your Admissions Liaison Officer
(ALO), do so. If you don't know who your ALO is, [[find him or
her](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3baf43&url=https://www.academyadmissions.com/admissions/outreach-programs/find-your-admissions-liaison-officer/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="academyadmissions.com"}]{.qlink_container} and reach out.
They will help with the entire admissions process.

Good luck!
