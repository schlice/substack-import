**Is the concept of a homeowner\'s association a contradiction with
American beliefs regarding private property? A person\'s home is their
castle.**

Not at all.

In fact, an HOA is a reaffirmation in American contract law.

Clearly, what you fail to realize is that a homeowner must voluntarily
choose to live in an area controlled by an HOA. When they purchase their
house, they actually physically sign the Covenants, which is a legally
binding contract between the HOA and the homeowner.

So homeowners dissatisfied with the fact that their home is in an area
controlled by an HOA are either completely ignorant about the papers
they signed when buying their house, had a poor real estate agent (who
didn't explain what an HOA is and what they were agreeing to), or were
*willfully ignorant* about what the HOA can do.

I know people who moved into areas controlled by HOAs with the attitude
of "I know the rules, but I'm just going to break them anyway, what can
they possibly do to me?" Those people found out the hard way that the
HOA can do quite a lot, especially when you agreed, UP FRONT, to follow
their rules.

If you don't like HOAs, don't buy a house in an area controlled by an
HOA. If you're in an area controlled by an HOA and you don't like it,
MOVE. Sell your house. It's a great time to do it.
