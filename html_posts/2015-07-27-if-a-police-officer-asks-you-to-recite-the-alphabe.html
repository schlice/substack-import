**Content:** [My kids actually learned to recite the alphabet backwards
in school, so I learned it with them. Spoken rythmically:\
\
ZYXWVUT,\
SRQPONM,\
LKJ, IHG,\
FEDC \<clap\> BA.\
\
However, before I had kids, I was driving a drunk classmake back to the
dorms and the gate guard stopped us when he smelled the inside of the
truck cab. He made me get out and when I got to the guard shack, his
sobriety test included reciting the alphabet backwards. I could barely
do it, but not because I was drunk; I just could barely do it.\
\
Officers won\'t ask you to recite the alphabet backwards. There are too
many cognitive impairments that could interfere with a proper outcome,
and since it\'s so unreliable, it\'s not used anymore.]{.rendered_qtext}
