I'll assume you're talking about iOS 10 since that's what you have in
the picture.

I'm pretty sure you can't. I've checked the settings on iOS 10's
Facebook Messenger and there is no option to turn off receiving calls
using iOS CallKit, which integrates VoIP applications with Apple's Phone
app.

Your only option is to uninstall Facebook Messenger.

Alternatively, you could contact Facebook and ask them to add an option
to use a different VoIP application instead of CallKit.

But they won't.

They don't want to. They want a VoIP call using Messenger to look
exactly like a phone call. That's the whole point. Notice that the only
difference between a cellular voice call and a Facebook Messenger call
is the text below the caller's name. That's intentional. The more used
to it you get, the easier it will be to start offering paid services to
you, and the less you'll use your cellular network for actually making
voice calls.

I also checked Android's version of Messenger and the preferences look
identical. I assume that there may be an app which can intercept a VoIP
call and send it to another VoIP app on a rooted Android phone, but I am
unaware if any exists.
