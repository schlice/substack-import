As long as the people are "of age," where is a "report" going to be
filed? Asking a question is not a crime, unless you are asking a
prostitute to have sex for money, but even in that circumstance, the
question is not the crime; the exchange of money for sex is the crime.

Nevertheless, there is no law in the United States that prevents people
who are not minors from asking for nudes.

However, if you're at work, it might be a different story. The person
being asked might consider it harassment to have been asked for nudes,
and report you to HR, in which case the worst that could happen is you
lose your job.

If you're at school, there is a good chance that one or both of you are
underage. If either the asker or the asked person are underage, and you
are at school, you have likely violated one of your school rules (check
your Student Handbook to be sure) and the worst that could happen is
that you get expelled. If your School Resource Officer gets involved,
you could be found guilty of solicitation of, or distribution of, child
pornography, which is a whole bucket of nope that you don't want to be
involved in. If either the asker or the asked party is under 18 in the
United States, **don't.**
