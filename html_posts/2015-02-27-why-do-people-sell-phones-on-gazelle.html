**Content:** [Simplicity.\
\
Gazelle is (almost) just a few clicks and you\'re done, shipping label
in hand. Once they have your device, you get paid.\
\
eBay is going through all the gyrations of starting an auction, waiting
for it to finish, shipping the item, and hoping the seller accepts the
item, before you can even think about using your money.\
\
The cost for that simplicity is a reduced amount you get back on your
device.]{.rendered_qtext}
