The correct answer, as with all legal questions, is "it depends."

If you live in a city or a county, there are usually laws which prohibit
the discharge of firearms within that city limits. So it doesn't matter
what you're shooting at, generally discharging a firearm is a crime,
usually a misdemeanor. This is purely a safety thing, because people
live in such close proximity that you can't have people randomly
shooting firearms, because even if you're not aiming at someone, the
population density simply means that you could *potentially* hit
someone.

If you live in unincorporated land, or in rural areas, there are usually
no laws against discharging firearms. So long as someone is not shooting
*at you*, then there really isn't much you can do about the discharge of
firearms. If they are doing it late at night, there are usually still
noise ordinances, so perhaps law enforcement could still get involved.

So check your local laws and see if there are any provisions against
discharge of firearms. If there are, contact your local law enforcement
and let them know about the neighbors who are unlawfully discharging
firearms. But again, be sure it is illegal where you live before you
contact the police.
