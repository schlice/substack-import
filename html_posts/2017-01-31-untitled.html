**Content:** []{.rendered_qtext}

You know something, I really needed this exchange. Although I shouldn't
let it (I know this intuitively), sometimes I let the negativity of
Quora get to me, and today was one of those days. Thank you for
reminding me that there are still good people out there who do just want
to learn for the sake of learning.

I'm glad I was able to help.
