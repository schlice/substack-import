Generally, no. The overhead bins of most aircraft are symmetrical.

The only exception I can think of would be the Embraer ERJ-145

This is a view from the front to the back, so the right side is on the
left of this picture. Notice that the right side has two seats, while
the left side only has one. There are only overhead bins on the right
side, so in this case, there is more luggage room on the right side.
