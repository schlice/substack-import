**Content:** [I\'d say you should be able to stop this behavior, because
if Craigslist can\'t identify you as you, then they can\'t identify
anyone else as you, and you could still be liable under
\"bait-and-switch\" even if you didn\'t post the ad, since no one at
Craigslist can verify that you are you.\
\
You probably can\'t sue Craigslist because they don\'t have adequate
spam protection. You might, however, be able to get Craigslist to block
ads for your business, or (if they refuse), get an injunction barring
Craigslist from posting any ads for your business.\
\
This also means that you won\'t be able to post ads as you, either.\
\
But that\'s just fine, at least it protects your business from such
malicious ads, especially since Craigslist doesn\'t have a viable way to
prove that you are you.]{.rendered_qtext}
