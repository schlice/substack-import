**Can shooting people in public with a Nerf gun be considered a crime?**

The answer is, of course, it depends.

This crime is called assault in most locations. Doesn't matter if you're
hit with a baseball bat, a fist, an open hand across the face, or a Nerf
dart, if it was intentional and not part of a Nerf gun fight, it's an
assault.

Also doesn't matter if you shoot someone in public or in private, but it
sounds like when you say "people in public" you mean "random strangers
on the street." In this case, it is most definitely assault, it is a
crime, you can go to jail for it, and if you injure them further (i.e.
you shoot them in the eye and you injure them), the subsequent assault
and battery lawsuit will see you paying for their eye care. It doesn't
make a lick of difference if you shoot them with a Nerf gun, a feather
gun, or a real gun. Assault is assault regardless of what it is touching
you.
