He's trying to use COVID to cover it up, but it's really too thin a
justification for that.

Ultimately, the president does not have the legal authority to cancel
contracts, or change the terms of contracts. He's attempting to void a
repayment contract, and he has no authority to do that.

Not so long ago, Nancy Pelosi
[[agreed](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4b09ec&url=https://twitter.com/rncresearch/status/1562137015314948096){.external_link

president of the United States has the power for \[student loan\] debt
forgiveness," Pelosi told the media last July. "He does not have that
power. That has to be an act of Congress."

Biden's legal justification, to the extent that he has one, is that the
HEROES Act "could be used to effectuate a program of categorical debt
cancellation directed at addressing the financial harms caused by the
COVID-19 pandemic."

Except that *his own office* ensured that there was actually no harm
from the loans caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, since they had initiated
a pause on student loan repayments, which has been in effect since March
13, 2020.

So they're claiming now that the COVID-19 pandemic is **so severe** that
loan payments **which no one has been required to make for the last two
and a half years** are still causing financial harms?

How, exactly?

Original question:

What legal or constitutional authority gives POTUS the authority to
change the student loan forgiveness (SLF) program by canceling a portion
of the SLF debt without Congressional approval?
