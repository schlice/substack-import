Depends on what you mean by "non-American."

Here's the basic requirements for enlisting in the Air Force (emphasis
mine):

- Be between 17 and 39 years of age.
- **Be a U.S. citizen or legal, permanent resident**
- Have a high school diploma, GED with at least 15 college credits, or
  GED

A "legal permanent resident" is not a full US citizen, so in that
respect, a "non-American" can join the Air Force, so long as he or she
is a legal, permanent resident.
