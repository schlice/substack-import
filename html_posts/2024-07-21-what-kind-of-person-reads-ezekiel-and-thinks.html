What kind of person reads Ezekiel and thinks \"That\'s the God I believe
in\"?

- The kind of person who doesn't read the Bible and evaluate its
  contents based on the norms of modern society.
- The kind of person who understands that God didn't send the people
  into exile to punish them. He sent them into exile to make good on His
  promises. They lived in sin and rebellion for centuries, and after
  centuries of warnings and invasions and prophets cautioning the people
  to change their ways, God had to step up His intervention to get their
  attention. The story of Ezekiel is a story of God's *intervention* for
  our *redemption*. *And if you look closely, it's the same story that
  God will tell again through the life, death, and resurrection of
  Christ.*
- The kind of person who is able to *correctly* *apply* the message of
  Ezekiel to us today. I'm certain that not everyone in that small
  community would have known why they were being uprooted. Some would,
  because they were the ones living in open rebellion against God, but
  some would not. Don't we find ourselves in that same situation today?
  I know we do, because I answer questions all the time on this platform
  from people who are basically asking "Why, God, why?" They ask why bad
  things happen to good people. They want to know where God is in all of
  their struggle. The people in exile had to wait five years for God to
  send Ezekiel, and when He did, Ezekiel delivered a prophetic message
  that they most likely didn't want to hear: God is sovereign over all,
  and the judgment the people were experiencing was as a result of their
  own sin.\
  \
  Now, this doesn't mean that everything that happens to us is as a
  result of *our own* sin, but everything **bad** that happens to us,
  even today, is as a direct or indirect result of sin in our world. It
  is up to us to lean on God during the hard times, even when things
  don't make sense to us. What pleases God is when we trust Him even
  when nothing else makes sense. Faith begins where logic ends.
