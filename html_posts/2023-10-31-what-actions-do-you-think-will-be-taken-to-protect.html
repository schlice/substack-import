Why do you feel that he needs special protection outside of any other
American citizen?

And why do think the insane ramblings of a delusional nutball pose any
significant threat to anyone?

If Sheriff Labat feels threatened, he has the entirety of the Fulton
County Sheriff's Office at his disposal; he can place himself under
24-hour surveillance by his own deputies, if he really feels there is a
valid threat.

Since he has not taken this drastic step, it's quite possible that he
believes that there is no threat.

I concur.
