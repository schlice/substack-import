What is a "right against searches?" Where is this right recorded?

Last I checked, the Constitution had a similar right listed. It was in
the 4th Amendment, and it said that you have a right against
***unreasonable*** search without first obtaining a warrant.

See, details matter.

So what's an "unreasonable" search? Is a search before voluntarily
entering a protected building reasonable? Is a search for guns prior to
entering a "gun-free zone" reasonable?

The courts have indeed ruled that such searches are considered
reasonable. So no warrant is required.

The Constitution says nothing about not being subjected to searches
before entering sterile areas, like airport terminals.

Original question:

If courthouses require compulsory searches for entry and jury duty
requires a person to enter the courthouse, how is a jury member's right
against searches maintained?
