**Content:** []{.rendered_qtext}

So let's re-word the question the way you think it should be read:

"Would a cop shoot a kid if they point an air soft pistol at them, the
cop identifies the weapon as a toy, but fires anyway?"

If that's the question, I'd answer, "Yes, if the cop wants to be guilty
of murder."

Generally though, what happens is that the cop **DOESN'T** realize it's
fake until it's too late.

That's the meaning of the question I addressed.

Please don't tell me I didn't address the question. Only a brain-dead
amoeba or a psychopath would realize the gun is fake and then decide to
take a life anyway. I just assumed the question was poorly worded.
