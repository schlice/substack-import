It [[does not

in their Vizio Internet Apps Plus list.

It appears that the only way to use HBO NOW on a Vizio TV is to purchase
a [[compatible streaming
device](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ea72b3&url=http://help.hbonow.com/app/answers/detailHBO/a_id/11/~/which-devices-work-with-hbo-now){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="hbonow.com"}]{.qlink_container}. You can use a compatible
game console (Xbox or PlayStation), or you can use a streaming TV device
from the list, which includes Roku, Chromecast, Apple TV, and Amazon
Fire TV or Fire TV Stick. You can also directly connect your compatible
computer to your TV and view it that way as well. Chromecast is unique
in that you actually stream the show from your computer or tablet to
your Chromecast, but it does work.

It also appears that some Samsung Smart TVs natively support the HBO NOW
app.
