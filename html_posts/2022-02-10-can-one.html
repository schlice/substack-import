Let me ask you this question.

Do you know your grandparents full names? Sure, you probably do. But do
you know all eight of your great grandparents full names? I bet very few
of you do.

We are forgotten in a blink of time. We do not generate any lasting
memories. Unless we are someone famous or influential, our lives flick
in and out of existence and no one remembers.

So ask yourself this question: if your *presence* has so little impact
on others' lives, ***why would you think that your absence would?***

Suicidal people tend to overestimate their impact on the world. They
think that the world would be better off without them. But this is just
as flawed logic as thinking that your *presence* makes the world a
better place.

I'm not trying to be mean or uncaring. I'm simply trying to be rational,
since we can all agree that the position of the suicidal person stems
from a point of irrational thinking.

And I also think that the suicide would only completely devastate a
handful of people, those who were closest to the person, like parents or
siblings, or best friends. Beyond that, the suicide will generate a
moment of sadness, maybe some self-reflection in others, but certainly
won't "completely devastate everyone who knew the victim." This is
actually another indication of exactly what I mentioned earlier.
Sometimes the suicidal person says, "I'll show them, I'll kill myself
and they will be hurt." But this is exactly the same sort of
overestimation of one's impact on the world (thinking that others will
be hurt by your passing) as is thinking that your presence makes their
life so much better.

See what I mean? If your presence doesn't meaningfully enrich others'
lives, why would you think that your absence would harm them?

The thoughts of the suicidal person stem from irrational thinking. What
the suicidal person needs, above all else, is *help*.

You might suggest to your friend that they reach out to one of the
organizations listed in the "There is Help" box on this page.

Original question:

Can one's suicide have more profound, unforeseeable consequences beyond
completely devastating everyone who knew the suicide victim? Asking this
as someone who has a suicidal friend and wishes to know more about the
subject.
