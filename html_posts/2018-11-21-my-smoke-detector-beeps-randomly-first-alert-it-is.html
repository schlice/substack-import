**My smoke detector beeps randomly (first alert). It is not a low
battery chirp, it is a full beep, but it only beeps once. It does it
once every one to two days. What could be the reason?**

There are generally not any default system beeps which occur as full
alert tones every few days. Most system tones are one to two short
chirps and take place on an interval of minutes, not days. Those system
chirps mean different things depending on the type of smoke detector you
have (for example, is it hardwired or battery only, does it include
carbon monoxide detection, etc).

Hearing alarm tones (not system chirps) every day or two sounds like an
issue with the detector itself.

If it were me, I'd advise you to replace the detector.
