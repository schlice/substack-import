**If I unroot my phone will it be just as I bought it from the store?**

That depends on the phone, but in most cases, yes it will. There are two
notable exceptions: manufacturer\'s warranty, and Samsung.

First, **rooting your phone voids the manufacturer\'s warranty.** If the
manufacturer has built a mechanism into the phone which allows them to
see whether or not you ever modified the boot loader, they can deny you
coverage under their standard 1 year hardware warranty. To that end,
never root a phone which is still under warranty.

Second, Samsung uses an *e-fuse* to indicate whether or not a custom
boot loader has ever been installed. The e-fuse is used by Samsung\'s
KNOX security software to create encrypted partitions within which
credit card information and other protected information is kept. The
presence of an intact e-fuse is required for KNOX to run. Installing a
custom boot loader, or modifying the existing boot loader,
**permanently** trips the e-fuse. Along with voiding the warranty, KNOX
software will never run again on that device, so you will never be able
to use some software like Samsung Pay, or other software which relies on
KNOX encryption.

Beyond those two examples, if you do install a custom OS or root your
device, in most other cases, restoring the factory image returns the
phone to the condition it was in before you rooted.

This, however, is no guarantee. Never root a phone that is still under
warranty, and never bank on the fact that you\'ll get your phone back to
its original condition after you unroot.
