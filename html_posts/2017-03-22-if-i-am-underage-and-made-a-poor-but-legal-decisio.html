The short answer is "it depends," and it depends on a lot of things,
like what federal agency you'd like to join, and what job you'll be
doing.

You don't give a lot of details, but it sounds like your only crime was
underage drinking. This alone probably won't prevent you from being
hired by a federal agency, but again, it depends a lot on which agency,
what kind of job, and what you'll be doing in that job. For example, if
you're going to be working with classified information, the background
investigation may reveal more about what you did, and that may speak to
your character and your ability to safely handle classified information
(which is all part and parcel of the background investigation before
being granted a security clearance). If you're not going to be working
in a highly sensitive organization, perhaps this would be less of a
concern.
