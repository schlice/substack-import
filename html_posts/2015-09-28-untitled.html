**Content:** [I could see myself as clearly in that vet\'s exam room
while you described your experience. Mine was so similar, because I too
told my wife that once she couldn\'t get herself up to go to the
bathroom, we\'d know it was time.\
\
When we put Jessie down (she was a golden retriever who lived to the
ripe old age of 15), she finally relaxed for the first time in a year,
and it was very relieving for me to see her relax. She had been fighting
non-cancerous tumors throughout her body. The one on her brain stem hit
her the hardest, as she lost balance and blood pressure control. She got
frequent nosebleeds and could only walk with help (the veterinary
neurologist gave us a vest with a \"carry handle\" on it. We knew we
were close at that point.\
\
When they gave Jessie the injection, the same vet who had been her
caregiver for all those years cried with us, then quietly left the room.
She gave us as much time as we wanted, and then we left the office by
the back door. It was painful; I was crushed. Time softens the blow, but
the dog-sized hole in your heart never really closes.]{.rendered_qtext}
