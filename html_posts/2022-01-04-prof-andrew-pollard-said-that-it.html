Does Professor Pollard believe this of the flu vaccine also?

We already do this for influenza; it doesn't seem like a big stretch to
add COVID-19 to the same protocol. An annual COVID shot, right alongside
your annual flu shot. We try to catch as many of the seasonal strains as
we can, otherwise we get sick.

As a person who was fully vaccinated and still got COVID and recovered,
that's exactly what it's going to look like. You'll either get the shot
or not, and if you were exposed to the strain for which you got the
shot, you won't get sick that year. Or you'll get sick, you'll be off
your feet for a week, and then you'll be back to normal, like most other
healthy people.

Original question:

Prof. Andrew Pollard said that it\'s not sustainable or affordable to
keep rolling out boosters and vaccines. What will we do to stay safe
when the booster wares off?
