**Hundreds of wacky, obsolete laws still exist. Why don't more states
remove them?**

We are all aware that obsolete laws are never enforced, thanks to the
police's ability to selectively enforce laws. and the district
attorney's ability to selectively prosecute laws, so long as it is done
in a uniform, 14th Amendment-approved manner (i.e. *not* enforcing that
law on anyone).

So why don't we remove these never-enforced, obsolete laws from the law
books? There are several reasons.

1.  There is an administrative cost to removing a law. Law books must be
    reprinted. People who require law books (lawyers, police, etc) must
    buy new copies of those law books. The law book publishers (i.e.
    LexisNexis and others) are quite happy when you remove a law,
    because they get to print an addendum and then a new full version of
    their law books, but no one else is particularly happy when they
    have to shell out bucks to buy an updated copy of the law books.
2.  Additionally, there is even further administrative cost to removing
    a law. Many states require a vote to remove a law from the state
    Constitution, which means all of the administrative cost to add the
    question to the ballot, following all of the legal requirements to
    do so (which requires lawyers, who will bill their time, of course),
    mailing out ballots, tallying ballots, etc.
3.  Valuable historical context may be lost. Just because a law doesn't
    apply now doesn't mean that this law didn't apply at some point in
    our history. Seeing the original law in its original context helps
    us shape new laws.
