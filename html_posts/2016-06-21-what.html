In some forms, we already have this. They are called **Auxiliary Police
Officers** and **Reserve Deputies**.

I will comment about Reserve Deputies since I have some experience in
the field. I was in my county's Reserve Deputy Academy in 2013, but a
medical issue forced me out. I intend on re-entering the Academy in
2017. The information I share about Reserve Deputies is probably unique
to my county (no two departments operate similarly, even in our own
state), but I believe we have the best Reserve program in the country,
and I'd put one of our Reservists up against any peace officer in the
nation any day.

Think of a Reserve Deputy in the same way you think of a volunteer
firefighter. Now you know what Reserve Deputies do. The official job
description for a Reserve Deputy begins, "Highly trained
community-minded volunteers" which pretty much sums up the entire
program.

They are fully-trained, POST-certified Reserve peace officers. They work
alongside full-time deputies and provide force augmentation services;
they are a *force multiplier*. They also perform *additional duties*
which cannot be filled by full-time deputies. Additionally, they are
*volunteers,* which means *unpaid,* saving the county money. They
receive over 300 hours of training in a Reserve Academy which meets two
nights a week and one weekend day for 22 weeks (since these folks all
have day jobs). They receive 50 hours of firearms training, 40 hours of
driving training, 40 hours of arrest control, and the remainder of the
time is spent in classroom-style learning. They also provide and pay for
all of their own uniforms and equipment, except for firearms, Tasers,
radios, and body armor, which are supplied by the county.

After graduating from the Academy and receiving their deputy's badges,
they progress through an OJT certification program, allowing them to
perform greater and more independent functions, until they can perform
any activity that any full-time deputy in the county can perform.

We also have **Citizen's Patrol** in the county, and **Community
Assistance Officers** in the city. They have a much shorter academy as
they are unarmed citizens, not sworn deputies. They are dispatched when
disabled motorists need assistance, or when a street needs to be closed.
It is the "step-down" from the Reserve Deputy or the Auxiliary Police
Officer.

Between these two volunteer functions, we probably already have
something akin to what you're asking for. But we need to ***expand***
these programs. Federal dollars could do that. De-emphasizing the "war
on drugs" would provide a source for those additional Federal dollars.
