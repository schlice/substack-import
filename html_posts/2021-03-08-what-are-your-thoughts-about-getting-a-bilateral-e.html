**What are your thoughts about getting a bilateral epididymectomy in
order to avoid ever causing any unplanned pregnancies and thus avoid
ever being hunted down for 18+ years\' worth of child support?**

I kinda think that's putting the cart before the horse, but you do you.

Although you probably wouldn't get a bilateral epididymectomy, you'd
probably get a vasectomy. Instead of removing the epididymus, we remove
a section of the vas deferens, apply clips and cauterization to both
ends, and close. It is generally regarded as less painful and less
invasive. Bilateral epididymectomies are generally reserved for those
with epididymitis, and even then, only when other interventions for
chronic epididymitis are unsuccessful.

The problem is that the procedure is difficult to reverse without both
significant cost and the likelihood of significant pain. Some
practitioners will cut costs by using techniques like sub-optimal
magnification and local anesthesia. Cutting costs provides for a lower
potential for success and increases the chances of side effects.

Look, it certainly will accomplish your goal. You can have sex with as
many women as you want and you'll never have to worry about having to
pay 18 years of child support. Just remember that you're making a body
alteration which is difficult and possibly quite painful to reverse.
