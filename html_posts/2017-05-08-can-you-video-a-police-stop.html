Police officers are no different than anyone else out in public. You can
record video of a traffic stop if the officer is in a public place just
as you can record video of anyone else in a public place.

That said, if the officer tells you you have to stand in a specific
place, or to stay back from the scene, or gives you any other
directions, you are still required to follow those directions. You
cannot shove your phone in the officer's face, or expect to get
arrested. You cannot interfere with the officer's performance of his
duties. Or, again, expect to be arrested.

But other than that, you can record anyone out in public.

By this point in our history, every officer assumes that he is being
recorded by no fewer than three cameras every time he steps out of the
cruiser, and probably at least one while he's in the car.
