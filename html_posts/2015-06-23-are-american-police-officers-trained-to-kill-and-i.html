**Content:** [To answer your specific question, police officers are not
trained on how to kill.\
\
Police officers are trained in the use of firearms. They can do so
quickly and efficiently. Police officers will \"shoot to stop the act.\"
That means they will keep firing at center mass until the act is
stopped. This often results in death. Firearms are deadly force, and
their employment will often result in the target being killed.\
\
However, it\'s a false equivalency to say that police officers are
trained to kill because they use firearms.\
\
To illustrate, if a police officer shoots someone and they live (which
happens more often than not), have they failed at their task? Clearly,
the answer is no, which means that the end result of the shooting is not
intended to be death.]{.rendered_qtext}
