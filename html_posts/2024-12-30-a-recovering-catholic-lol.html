Yes. I am a recovering Catholic. It's supposed to be tongue-in-cheek, as
if Catholicism is an addiction and I'm recovering from that. Ha ha, very
funny.

But I had to *un-learn* all the stuff I believe is unbiblical from my
childhood through my college time. So literally for the first 22 years
of my life, I had to un-learn all of those things Catholicism taught me
which are a bit left-of-center from what the Bible actually teaches.

I now open the floor to questions.
