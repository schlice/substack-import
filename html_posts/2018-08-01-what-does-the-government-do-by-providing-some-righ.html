**What does the government do by providing some rights to the citizens
that cannot be violated?**

If government grants (provides) a right, then government can take away a
right.

Therefore, "unalienable" rights are not granted by government.

For example, the Bill of Rights merely prevents government from
infringing on rights already possessed by the people. It doesn't "grant"
rights.
