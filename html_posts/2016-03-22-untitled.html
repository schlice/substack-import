I wonder in how many jurisdictions a certification such as a Red Cross
CPR/First Aid course (which is pretty common; we give it to our Boy
Scouts routinely) legally creates a duty to assist, and what the
limitations to that duty are. Are you aware?

My employer gave us CPR/FA/AED training when we got AEDs in the
building, so we\'d have some trained people around on a regular basis. I
wonder if that created an affirmative duty to assist. Not like I
wouldn\'t help anyway. I\'m just curious.

BTW, the new Resusci-Annies are really cool; they work with the AED as
well and indicate when you got the pad placement correct.
