Oh yes, most definitely.

First of all, it's not the victim's fault, despite his persuasion. It's
not the book's fault, or the gun's fault. It's the girl's fault, because
she held the gun, and she pulled the trigger. When you take on the
responsibility of pulling the trigger, you take on the responsibility
for what happens to the bullet. Anything the bullet touches is your
responsibility. If you are unaware of this, you should not touch a gun,
let alone a Desert Eagle chambered in .50 AE. Taking someone's *word for
it* is a fatally-flawed line of reasoning.

Secondly, there is *exactly* a crime for this. Manslaughter is "the
unlawful taking of a life." There was no forethought; in fact, she
thought that she was *not* going to kill (a terribly ill-contrived and
incorrect thought, but that was her honest thought nonetheless). There
was no malice; she had no intention to kill. She was charged exactly as
she should have been under the statutes in her jurisdiction.

She was legally allowed to own a gun, so there was no crime there. Where
they were located, there are no laws against discharging a firearm, so
no crime there.

The manslaughter charge was absolutely justified.
