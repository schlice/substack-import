Seriously, sometimes Google can be your friend. This article is very
well researched and talks about the differences:

[[Arbitration, Mediation and Conciliation: differences and similarities
from an International and Italian business
perspective](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e03195&url=http://www.mediate.com/articles/sgubinia2.cfm){.external_link

Arbitration is the most like a courtroom: the parties have less control
over the outcome, and the arbitrator has the final say about
compensation that each party is required to pay.

Mediation and Conciliation are two processes that are more inclusive and
encourage the parties to come to mutually beneficial agreement.
