**All of the bloodshed today makes me cry, even though the use and
permitting of guns allow violence to be at an all-time low in history.
When will guns be permanently banned in America?**

God-willing, guns will never be permanently banned in America.

There are many reasons for this. Here are just a few:

1.  People will always be violent with each other, because that is human
    nature. The presence or absence of guns does not change this.
2.  Criminals, by their very nature, do not follow laws. It is already
    illegal to commit crime. The criminal who is breaking the law to
    commit a crime is really unconcerned that he breaks a second law by
    using a gun to do so. Banning guns does nothing to stop the
    criminal, it only affects the citizens who follow the law, leaving
    them less able to defend themselves.
3.  Criminals will always find a way to get guns. I know that some
    people say that if we ban guns from law-abiding citizens' hands,
    then criminals won't be able to steal them. That's literally like
    telling the Kindergarten class that no one can play with toys
    because one bully likes to steal them. We don't prevent the criminal
    from committing a criminal act by turning law-abiding citizens into
    criminals.
4.  Not all gun use is bad. Defensive gun uses far outnumber offensive
    ones. Anywhere from 350,000 to 2.5 million times per year,
    law-abiding citizens will use firearms to defend themselves, often
    without a single shot being fired. The difference in the numbers?
    You don't report a crime that never took place to the police.
    Therefore, we have little more than survey data to indicate exactly
    how much crime is prevented by guns. Using representative sampling,
    we can *estimate*, but we know that at a certain level (at least
    350,000), these defensive uses did occur. It is likely much more.
5.  This nation was founded on **freedom** and rugged individualism.
    These ideals still live on in Americans today. Our laws were
    structured around this freedom; namely the fact that **your security
    is your responsibility**. In fact, many Supreme Court cases have
    found that the police have no responsibility to defend you from
    crime. Their responsibility is to find those who break the law and
    bring them to justice, hold them accountable for their crimes. While
    they do what they can to prevent crime, they cannot be there to
    prevent all crime.

There are more reasons than this, but these are just the basics. We
could go into resistance to tyranny and the unalienable right to
self-defense, but this is enough for now.
