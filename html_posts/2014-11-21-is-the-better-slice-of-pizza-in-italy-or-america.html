**Content:** [The answer is \"it depends on which one you think tastes
better.\"\
\
Since \"which is better\" is a subjective answer, I will tell you about
the definite difference between the two.\
\
In Italy, and anywhere traditional Italian pizza is made, it is cooked
in a brick oven using hardwoods as the heat source. The pizza oven heats
to very high temperature (approaching anywhere from 850-1000 degrees),
cooking the pizza in minutes and producing a hard, crunchy crust.
Italian pizzas are generally smaller, and are easy to eat like a
cracker, retaining its shape as you pick it up.\
\
When Italian pizza recipes were brought to America (to New York City,
where most immigrants came, and later to Chicago), pizza ovens were not
wood-fired, as there wasn\'t much wood to be had in the big city.
Coal-fired ovens were the order of the day, and the temperature was
significantly (in pizza-land) cooler, around 450-550 degrees. This
resulted in longer baking times and produced softer crusts than you
could achieve with a wood oven. Thus, you see New York-style pizza as
very large, thin slices that are routinely \"folded\" down the middle
for ease of eating.\
\
Electric pizza ovens are usually set to around 500-550 degrees. They
don\'t generate the same quality of heat that brick wood-fired ovens do,
and the pizza cooks differently.]{.rendered_qtext}
