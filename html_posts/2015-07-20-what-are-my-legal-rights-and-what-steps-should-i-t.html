**Content:** [Remember that we can\'t give you specific legal advice on
Quora. You need to retain an attorney to get specific legal advice.
Therefore, I can\'t tell you what to do in your situation. I can\'t tell
you what charges you should look into pursuing, as these are things that
your lawyer should advise you on. By the way, you should get a lawyer.\
\
Locking you in a room is either called kidnapping or imprisonment,
depending on where you are located.\
\
Throwing a chair at you causing a bruise is called assault, or assault
and battery, depending on where you live.\
\
Either one of those two scenarios would have warranted a call to the
police.\
\
Facebook, along with many large online sites, offers **two-factor
authentication**, which requires you to enter a code that is either sent
by text message or provided by the Code Generator page in the Facebook
app of your phone. If you have the means, I strongly suggest you enable
two-factor authentication in as many of your online accounts as you
can.\
\
You can absolutely get a restraining order in most jurisdictions with
less evidence than you currently have. Talk to your lawyer about getting
a restraining order.\

Good luck!]{.rendered_qtext}
