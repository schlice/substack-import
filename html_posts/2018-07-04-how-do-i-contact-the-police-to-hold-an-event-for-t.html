**How do I contact the police to hold an event for them?**

I suggest you contact the department's public affairs office. That
number should be available in the phone book, but if not, call the main
switchboard number for the department and ask for public affairs. That
number is definitely in the phone book.

Please do not call 911 for this. I know, you shouldn't have to say that,
but actually you do. Some people...

Anyway, public affairs should most definitely be able to assist you.
