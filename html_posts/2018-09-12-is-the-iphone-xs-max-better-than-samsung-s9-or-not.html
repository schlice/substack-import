**Is the iPhone Xs Max better than Samsung S9 or Note 9?**

The short answer is "it depends."

"Better" is a matter of opinion. So what is better to one person may not
be better to someone else.

To me, better falls into two categories: comparisons of specs on paper,
and how those specs translate into real-world performance.

On paper, some of the specs in the Xs Max are certainly better than
what's found in the Note 9. The processor is the big story here: the 7
nm production process creating the A12 Bionic chip is so far the best on
paper in the industry. The cameras are, on paper, really good, but not
much better than the X. The display is also really good, but better than
the Note 9? On paper, it's pretty much a wash.

As far as "how the paper specs translate into real world performance,"
that remains to be seen. People are going to have to start getting them
"in-hand" and doing some real-world comparison analyses to really see if
that "on-paper" spec translates into a better real-world performance
bump.

I suggest watching some of the more well-known YouTube tech vloggers
such as [[Marques

say when they start getting devices in-hand. Lew [[already has a

bet he's talking about this very topic. I haven't even seen that one
yet.
