**If you pay for your health insurance out of your paycheck, then why
does your employer have any right telling you what services/medicine you
can get?**

Because you don\'t pay for all of your health plan.

In fact, you only pay for a very small portion of the cost of your
health plan. Your employer pays for the bulk of your plan. Your monthly
cost plus your copays and your coinsurance costs still don\'t add up to
even more than half of the total cost of your insurance plan.

Your employer pays for most of it, which is why it is offered as a
benefit to you. To that end, they can determine what services they will
cover.

To be clear, no one is telling you what services or medicine you can
get. If you can get it, you can get any service or medicine (some
require prescriptions and some require referrals). They are only telling
you which ones they will help pay for. You are free to get any other
service on your own, and pay the full retail cost out of your own
pocket.
