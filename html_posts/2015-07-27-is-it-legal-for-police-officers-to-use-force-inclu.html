**Content:** [The use of force was legal. The police ordered the man
away from the house and he refused to comply. Yes, the homeowner was
trying to save his home. But the article is clearly biased against law
enforcement, so you don\'t see the other side of the story from the
people charged with ensuring public safety.\
\
The situation was unsafe. While the homeowner has the right to protect
his home, what would have been the outcome if the police allowed the man
to stand there and he got burned, or worse? Again, the police would have
been sued for not keeping him safe. Sometimes, the police have to
protect you *even if you don\'t want to be protected.*\
\
Also, it\'s the firefighters job to protect the property, as well as
neighboring properties. Even though they had not yet arrived, anyone
with fire experience knows that a property which is that far involved in
a fire won\'t be mitigated by a garden hose.\
\
Fires are tragic property losses. No need to compound them by adding
threatening the loss of life as well.\
\
(EDIT) I didn\'t answer the second part of the question, which was how
would this apply to suicide prevention. Suicide intervention is a
completely different animal, as occasionally the suicidal person will
\"force the hand\" of the police by intentionally threatening the life
of an officer to get him to use deadly force against him, which was his
goal from the start. This action is colloquially known as \"suicide by
cop.\"\
\
Police need to be especially tactful and cautious if they encounter an
individual who is prepared to take his own life, as often these
situations are very volatile as the victim is generally not in a stable
frame of mind. Therefore, actions which might seem completely illogical
to you would seem totally normal to the victim, and so a situation like
this can get out of hand very quickly.]{.rendered_qtext}
