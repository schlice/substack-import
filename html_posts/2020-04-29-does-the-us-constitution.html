**Does the US Constitution\'s Fourth Amendment protect your cell phone
from being seized and searched?**

Yes, the Fourth Amendment covers you and all of your property and
possessions.

As always, there are exceptions.

The Fourth Amendment says that you cannot be subject to
***unreasonable*** search and seizure. Reasonableness is the ultimate
determining factor in whether or not a search is prohibited by the
Amendment. The implication here is that *some* searches are *reasonable*
and are allowed.

For example, if an officer has asked if he can search your car and you
agreed, the officer can search without a warrant. This is considered
reasonable. Searches after you are arrested are also reasonable, as are
searches without a warrant when exigent circumstances exist, such as
imminent destruction of evidence, or when people are in imminent danger.
Also, there is no Fourth Amendment protection if the items are in plain
view, but the *contents* of a cell phone have a reasonable expectation
of privacy if it is locked by a PIN or passcode.
