The answer is "it depends," because each academy is going to be looking
for a different cadet profile in order to meet the needs of that service
at that time.

You're going to meet people who were accepted into multiple service
academies. You're going to meet people who were only accepted into one.
It all depends on what the individual academies were looking for at that
particular time, and how competitive you were at that time for an
appointment, in comparison to the rest of the applicant pool for that
class.

If you are a person who is competitive for academy appointment, you
should apply to multiple academies, and then secure your nomination to
that academy from the source who has slots to give for that school.

None of the academies are demonstrably harder than the others. In fact,
we have exchange programs where we send junior-year cadets intra-Academy
for a semester. We'd often have squids and grunts mixed in with the
zoomies on the terrazo.
