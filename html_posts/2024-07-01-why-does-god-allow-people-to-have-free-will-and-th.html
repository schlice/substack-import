**Love, by definition, must be freely given. It cannot be coerced.**

C. S. Lewis wrote, "the Irresistible and the Indisputable are the two
weapons which the very nature of \[God's\] scheme forbids Him to use.
Merely to over-ride a human will (as His felt presence in any but the
faintest and most mitigated degree would certainly do) would be for Him
useless. He cannot ravish. He can only woo."
