**Is there any real importance connected to Trump being the only
president impeached in the first term?**

There would have been, had there been real evidence of crimes being
committed and had there been broad, bipartisan support for articles of
impeachment.

What you have here, that you have never had before in any presidential
impeachment in history, is exactly what Alexander Hamilton warned us
against: impeachment based solely on which party controls the House.

This was a partisan show, not an impeachment. So the fact that it
happened in the first term is entirely insignificant, a footnote in
history. It shows more that this was nothing more than a three-year
temper tantrum on the part of the Democrats who are still butt hurt that
the pantsuited she-devil who they had anointed to become President was
overthrown by a poorly spray-tanned and horribly coiffed reality TV
star.
