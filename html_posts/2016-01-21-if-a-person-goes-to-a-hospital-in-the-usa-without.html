According to the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act
(EMTALA), any person who goes to an emergency room must be stabilized
and treated for life-threatening illness or injury, regardless of their
ability to pay. Hospitals are required to provide \"emergency medical
treatment\" which is lifesaving treatment and/or stabilization, and
provide treatment for women in \"active labor\" (water has broken).

(Note that ERs do not have to provide non-lifesaving treatment to
persons who cannot pay.)

Once that treatment is done, someone still has to pay the bill. So
several things will happen:

1.  The hospital will try to collect from the individual.
2.  If the individual cannot pay any of the bill (i.e. no income at
    all):
    1.  The hospital will try to determine whether or not the person
        qualifies for Medicare or Medicaid, and try to collect the money
        from them.
    2.  The hospital may try to write off the debt:
        1.  If the hospital is non-profit, it might write off the cost
            as \"charity.\" In order to maintain non-profit status, the
            hospital has to do a certain amount of \"charity\" work.
        2.  If the hospital is for-profit, it may write the debt off as
            \"bad debt\" which is then used to calculate Medicare and
            Medicaid reimbursement rates, allowing the hospital to
            command higher reimbursement from the government
    3.  The hospital can then use the \"bad debt\" or \"charity\"
        numbers to attempt to ply more from paying customers\' insurance
        plans, making it more expensive for everyone else to get care.
3.  If the person is employed but underinsured, or if they do have some
    form of income, the hospital will send the remainder of the bill to
    collections, which can bankrupt the individual.

One way or another, the hospital will get paid. The hospital will also
get paid at the expense of the other, paying, customers, in one way or
another.
