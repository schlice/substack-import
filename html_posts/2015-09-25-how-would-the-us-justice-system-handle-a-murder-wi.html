**Content:** [They couldn\'t be tried separately or in parallel, because
you would have to charge both of them with the crime. Since it\'s clear

described means that it\'s not time to charge either one, because you
either have evidence that implicates both of them, or you don\'t have
enough evidence to implicate one over the other.\
