You don't *need* to praise God. God certainly doesn't *need* praise. God
is omnipotent. God already *has everything.* God needs nothing.

But God ***deserves*** praise.

The God of the Universe, who is so powerful that He literally created
the entire Universe and everything in it with nothing but the breath of
His words, knows you personally and cares enough about you that **even
if you were the only person who needed to be saved,** He would still
have willingly gone to the cross and died for you.

That's how much He cares for you.

And that's why He deserves praise.
