I'm going to focus my answer on the US. What other countries do is up to
them.

There's a lot of mistrust, as well as outright sheep-like devotion, to
what the top scientists in public policy are saying. There are
scientists all over the debate: some think the vaccines are useless, and
others think the vaccines work like vaccines.

The point is, we don't really know. But the facts so far are telling us
that the vaccines work like vaccines, and for the ***vast majority of
the population***, if you're vaccinated, it's unlikely you'll contract
the disease.

Putting the science aside for the moment, look at what is happening, and
what those actions are telling us. The government is pushing a massive
ad campaign to get people vaccinated. There has to be a reason that they
are doing this. At the same time, policymakers are relaxing mask
mandates across the country.

So, we are pushing a massive vaccine campaign, and relaxing mask
mandates. The only reason that these two facts can co-exist is because
the government believes (as I do) that vaccines work.

So why are vaccinated people so hesitant to remove their masks? Why are
they so fearful? The virus is not as deadly as the media makes it out to
be. Hospitalizations for COVID infections are 2.6 per 100,000 for adults
as of this writing. That is a shockingly low number. COVID cases among
adolescents are down by 84% and hospitalizations are down 69% since
January.

Why is that? **Vaccinations of adults.**

The grand takeaway: **Vaccines work.**

So, here's the money shot, the \$64,000 question: **If vaccines work,
why do we still have mask mandates? If masks work, why don't they? If
vaccines work, why don't they?** Because *if a fully vaccinated person
can transmit a disease to another fully vaccinated person, then vaccines
don't work.*

Besides, "transmitting a virus" when neither person gets the virus means
**NOTHING**. That virus will not be able to multiply or infect the host,
so it dies. Period. That's science.

The only people at risk are the unvaccinated.

However, here's the kicker: **that's on them.**

It's not as if there is a massive shortage of vaccines. Heck, [[the US
government is buying vaccines to give away to other
countries.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=933212&url=https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/09/us-is-in-discussions-with-moderna-on-buying-covid-vaccine-doses-for-other-nations.html){.external_link

In nearly all cases, the vaccine is free. It's available everywhere, and
it's available to everyone.

**So if you don't get it, that decision is on you.**

Now, the next point can't fail to come off as heartless or uncaring, but
I'm going to say it anyway: **that's not my problem.**

Don't put your refusal to get the vaccine on me. Don't make your refusal
to get the vaccine into my problem. You have no right to do that. Your
refusal to get the vaccine is on you. You assume the risk of
participating in society without the vaccine.

Look, I get it. Some people can't get the vaccine. Those people should
either remain double-masked, or stay home. That's the reality of some
peoples' conditions that doesn't allow them to be vaccinated. Hopefully
they have good support systems to help them, and there is a fully formed
supply chain that can get them everything they may need delivered to
their door.

**But if you choose to not get the vaccine for whatever reason, you also
choose to take on the consequences of that choice.** One of the
consequences may be contracting COVID-19.

The bottom line: if you choose to participate in society, you choose to
accept certain risks. One of those risks is that you may contract any
number of diseases from exposure to carriers who may be asymptomatic.
Not just with COVID, but with any number of other diseases. There is no
malice here. That's not anyone's fault. Viruses are indiscriminate; they
will spread everywhere and infect wherever they have the ability. Just a
few years ago, we had a smallpox outbreak in the US because a group of
people chose to participate in society without being vaccinated against
smallpox. Vaccines work if you let them.

I'm fully vaccinated, but could I still contract COVID-19? I guess it's
possible, even though the risk is vastly reduced. And if I do, then
that's on me. It's no one else's fault that I was infected. It's not my
fault either. Viruses don't care who they infect. There is no blame,
there is no fault. It just is. I choose to participate in society; I
accept the risk. I accept the risk that someone will play themselves off
as being fully vaccinated and will be shedding virus around me. I accept
the risk that a fully masked person may also shed virus and I could
inhale some. I probably already have at some point. But I personally
accept that risk because I personally choose to participate in society
at large.

What I **steadfastly refuse to do** is accept the blame for *someone
else's choices*. In other words, I don't wear a mask to reduce *your*
risk. I wear a mask to reduce *my* risk. If you refuse to get
vaccinated, I don't have to change my life to accommodate your choices.
It's up to you to change your life to accommodate your choices. It's not
up to me to change my life to accommodate them.

I accept my risk, you accept yours.

That's the very nature of a free society.

**What is your opinion of the CDC relaxed facemask rule of fully
vaccinated people don\'t have to wear masks indoors and outdoors? Do you
trust people to follow the guidelines or will you still wear a mask?**
