My best friend at USAFA was prior enlisted at Plattsburg AFB in upstate
New York. He worked on avionics and automatic flight controls (I have no
idea why I remember that) on the F-111. Several flavors of F-111s were
flown out of Plattsburg, but this story involves the Ravens (EF-111As)
that had the large electronic countermeasures (ECM) pod at the tip of
the vertical stab:

Realize that this is early to mid 80s when this happened: no cell
phones, and TV was still broadcast OTA (over-the-air). The story is told
that a right-seater in the Raven had a house that was roughly on final
approach for one of the runways at Plattsburg. Apparently, he would let
his wife know that he made it home by quickly powering on and powering
off the ECM pod when he was over his house. This would cause all the TVs
in the neighborhood to briefly "fuzz out." It was also entirely outside
of regulation.

Eventually, other people in the neighborhood complained to the base that
their aircraft were interfering with their TVs. A little research,
matching up the incidents to flight plans, and the culprit was quickly
discovered and disciplined.
