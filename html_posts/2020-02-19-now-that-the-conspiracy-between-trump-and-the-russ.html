**Now that the conspiracy between Trump and the Russians is revealed,
why is not a second impeachment forthcoming?**

You have to ask yourself this question: **why now?**

Why is all of this information coming to light now? Why wasn\'t any of
this information given to Robert Mueller during the Russia collusion
probe?

To answer that question, look at who this revelation would benefit the
most.

- *Who is putting this revelation forward?* Julian Assange.
- *Who benefits the most by this revelation?* Julian Assange.

So, is it more likely that Trump has engaged in a massive conspiracy
with Russia to hack the 2016 election, or is it more likely that Julian
Assange will say anything and everything that he possibly can in order
to prevent himself from being extradited to the United States?

If you have two explanations for a thing, and one explanation is wildly
out there, and one explanation is more likely, it is usually the more
likely explanation that is the correct one.
