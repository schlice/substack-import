**Does my site need to be ADA compliant?**

As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."

Currently, the law is a little bit murky when it comes to ADA compliance
on a website. Courts have been interpreting ADA in various ways when it
comes to website compliance. Some courts have stated that any US
business must have an ADA-compliant website. Some courts have said that
the website must have a "nexus" to a physical location which must be ADA
compliant before their website must also be compliant. This is why
Facebook was able to dismiss a 2011 ADA case in California, but Home
Depot was not. Finally, some courts have stated that ADA simply does not
apply to websites.

While the law is still all over the map right now, it's worth noting
that in a personal ADA lawsuit, the only remedies available are
injunctions which force you to bring the website into ADA compliance,
and attorney's fees. If it becomes a Federal case and the DOJ becomes
involved, they may invoke other civil penalties and/or fines.

Your best bet is to get ahead of the law and make your website
ADA-compliant. NOTE: This is an external link. I do not endorse or
