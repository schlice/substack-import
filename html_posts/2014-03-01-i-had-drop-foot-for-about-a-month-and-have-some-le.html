<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I\'m guessing you are asking me to weigh in on your issue.<br>There\'s not enough information to provide an answer, so let me just<br>give you a few points to consider.\<br>\<br>Until all your blood tests come back, we can\'t be sure what caused the<br>white spots on your MRI. Your neurologist took blood for a series of<br>tests colloquially called \"little white spot\" tests. There are lots of<br>things that can cause white spots on an MRI. Even migraines and head<br>injuries can cause them. The spots by themselves do not indicate MS.\<br>\<br>The MRI is a piece of evidence in the \"body of evidence\" indicating<br>MS. And since MS is a diagnosis of exclusion, you have to exclude<br>everything else that could cause those symptoms. And since there are<br>some very valid causes for your symptoms, I would initially postulate<br>that your neurologist is correct and you had a pinched nerve, and not<br>MS.\<br>\<br>However, the verdict remains to be delivered, so let us know what<br>happens following your next neuro appointment.]<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
