**Content:** [I\'m guessing you are asking me to weigh in on your issue.
There\'s not enough information to provide an answer, so let me just
give you a few points to consider.\
\
Until all your blood tests come back, we can\'t be sure what caused the
white spots on your MRI. Your neurologist took blood for a series of
tests colloquially called \"little white spot\" tests. There are lots of
things that can cause white spots on an MRI. Even migraines and head
injuries can cause them. The spots by themselves do not indicate MS.\
\
The MRI is a piece of evidence in the \"body of evidence\" indicating
MS. And since MS is a diagnosis of exclusion, you have to exclude
everything else that could cause those symptoms. And since there are
some very valid causes for your symptoms, I would initially postulate
that your neurologist is correct and you had a pinched nerve, and not
MS.\
\
However, the verdict remains to be delivered, so let us know what
happens following your next neuro appointment.]{.rendered_qtext}
