You cannot force the landlord to evict a paying tenant, even if you have
evidence of ongoing bad behavior.

You said the police were called. That's your avenue.

Your next step is to hire a civil rights attorney. You and your attorney
can start putting pressure on the landlord and the police to take
action, or your next step will be to begin making claims of civil rights
violations.
