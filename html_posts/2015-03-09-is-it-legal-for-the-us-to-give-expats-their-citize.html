**Content:** [The government cannot take away your citizenship, unless
you weren\'t a citizen in the first place and were naturalized. It\'s
called being \"denaturalized.\" I\'ve heard of lots of federal cases
where I thought that US citizens should lose their citizenship, but take
heart, the government cannot do this. You can revoke your citizenship,
but it\'s a choice you have to make in front of a magistrate in an
embassy outside the US, and it is permanent.\
\
Many US citizens have dual citizenship and they don\'t forfeit their US
citizenship because of it. Expats (US citizens living outside of the
country) are still subject to some Federal income tax on money they make
while living outside of the country; they still file 1040s as well as a
bunch of other tax forms. State taxes vary based on state of residency;
for example, if you are a New York state resident and you live outside
the state, you don\'t pay state income tax (I never paid New York state
income tax while I was Active Duty stationed around the country).\
\
You can lose your citizenship if you were naturalized. You can\'t lose
your citizenship if you are born American.\
\
If you have been paying taxes, you are entitled to the benefits of those
taxes, regardless of where you physically live.]{.rendered_qtext}
