**Can a cop give you a ticket for parking in a parking meter spot but
you are still in the car?**

Can they? Of course they can. Will it hold up? Unlikely.

"Parking" and "Standing" have two legally distinct definitions. If
you're still in the car in the operator's position, your vehicle is
technically "standing." Once you get out and leave the vehicle, it is
now "parked."

Of course, this is highly dependent on local laws, local definitions of
parking and standing, and local laws regarding stopping, standing, or
parking.
