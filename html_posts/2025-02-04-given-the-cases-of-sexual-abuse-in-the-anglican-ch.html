Let's re-phrase your question to see if we can gain some understanding:

***Given that sin exists in the world and that everyone is a sinner, how
can anyone evangelize?***

The answer is simple. It's in the Bible.

> *but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners,
> Christ died for us. \-- Romans 5:8 ESV*

And there it is. Christ died for us **while we were sinners.**

See, God doesn't wait for us to become perfect before He redeems us. We
don't take a bath before we take a shower. Christ didn't come to heal
the *well*, He came to heal the *sick*. He loves us and redeems us
**while we are sinners**. Not after.

\

Secondly, the Church has no moral authority. The church isn't the one
handing out moral dicta. **The morality is God's morality.** The church
is just the mouthpiece. And since the church is made up of people, the
church will always be marred by the stain of sin.

That doesn't mean that the church doesn't strive for holiness. That
doesn't mean the church doesn't use Biblical principles when it
encounters active sin in its members. But it does mean that the church
is nevertheless commanded to preach the Gospel regardless of how sinless
we personally are.
