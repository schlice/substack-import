**If an employee constantly harasses and abuses a disabled coworker and
the store fails to take adequate action, can a lawsuit be filed against
the store?**

Any harassment by any employee against any other employee can result in
a lawsuit. It's just worse for the perpetrator if the person is disabled
as well, because additional charges under separate disability protection
laws can also be filed along with the harassment and hostile work
environment lawsuits.

Both the harasser and the employer would be liable.

However, the person being harassed needs to give the employer the
opportunity to fix it. That person needs to go to his/her manager, HR
department, etc, and report the harassment, and give the employer the
opportunity to correct the situation.

If they fail to do so, then the lawsuits are the appropriate remedy.
