So if you are right and the purpose of life is to serve God, then free
will makes no sense. Therefore, the fact that we have free will speaks
against the purpose of life being to serve God.

It makes more sense if the purpose of our life is instead to **freely
choose whether to love Him or reject Him, without coercion.** For love,
by definition, must be given freely, it cannot be coerced.

Free will makes much more sense if we are to use it to freely choose
Him. In that way, He doesn\'t have a bunch of robots in the new kingdom.
Everyone who is there is there willingly.
