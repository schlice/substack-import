One of the first things we learned in our *Ethics of Law* class:

***You can\'t legislate morality.***

But why not? Isn\'t law the imposition of the morality of a legislator
onto the masses? Don\'t we impose our will (and thereby our morality)
onto the population through the imposition of law?

Yes and no.

The law that is imposed on the population is the minimum set of moral
standards required to function as a civil society. So, in a way, laws do
set morality, but only the most basic of morality. The laws we pass are
the minimum required standard of morality, not its height. Laws are
basic rules that people must obey if they are going to be able to live
side by side in a mutually beneficial arrangement. ***Laws, therefore,
set a baseline for human morality in a civil society***. Clearly, not
all citizens can live up to the standard set by the law, but laws (and
therefore basic required moral codes in any civil society) are defined
by the majority and are agreed to by the whole.

Laws certainly are not the end-all, be-all of morality. Why? Because
after the bare minimums are met, morality becomes *relative.* Above the
basics required for a society to function, **your** morality may not
apply to everyone. My morality says that we should go to church on
Sunday. Yours may not. Should we make a law that says that everyone must
go to church on Sunday? Certainly not! Our laws allow for the free
exercise of religion, or no religion at all. This means that each
citizen is allowed to exercise his or her own moral code when it comes
to religion; the state will not impose that set of moral standards on to
you. So in this situation (my morality says to go to church, yours may
not), whose morality is right? The answer is that both of our
moralities, in a free society, are right, and you have as much right to
live by your moral code as I have to live by mine.

Your statement about universal morality is untrue because once we have
passed the baseline of moral behavior to live in a civil society,
moralities differ. There is no such thing as universal morality. Many
have tried to define it, using various names. The UN put together a
statement of basic human rights (called the \"Universal Declaration of
Human Rights\"), which is, in essence, another attempt to set a baseline
for all human morality. But again, these are just baselines. They are
not moral life goals.

Laws set the baseline. Hopefully, your search for knowledge,
understanding, community, compassion, connection, and enlightenment set
the limit.
