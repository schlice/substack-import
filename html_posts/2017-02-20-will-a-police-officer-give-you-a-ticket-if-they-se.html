They absolutely can. If they observed you driving without your seat
belt, or (in most states) as a front-seat passenger without your seat
belt, the observation is all that matters. At the time of the
infraction, the infraction itself is all that counts.

Would they apply some leniency if they saw you applying your seat belt
later? Maybe. It's up to the individual officer and the circumstances
under which you were stopped. Perhaps you'll get some credit for
(eventually) doing the right thing. Perhaps not. In any case, putting
the seat belt on later has no impact on the actual infraction.
