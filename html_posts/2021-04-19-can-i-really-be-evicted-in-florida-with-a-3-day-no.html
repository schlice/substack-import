**Can I really be evicted in Florida with a 3-day notice for reasons
other than non-payment?**

You can't be evicted in 3 days. Your lease can be terminated in either 3
or 7 days, and you may have the opportunity to correct your breach of
contract. Eviction requires a court order.

For reasons other than non-payment, if you materially breach your rental
agreement, you either have 7 days to "cure" it (or fix it, if it is of a
"fixable nature"), or you have 7 days to "quit" the unit (i.e. move
out). If the item is not of a fixable nature, the landlord can simply
tell you that your lease is terminated and you have 7 days to move out.

If it is fixable (i.e. activities in contravention of the lease or
Florida statute such as having or permitting unauthorized pets, guests,
or vehicles; parking in an unauthorized manner or permitting such
parking; or failing to keep the premises clean and sanitary), the
landlord will present you with a 7-day "cure or quit" notice which
reads:

> You are hereby notified that (cite the noncompliance) . Demand is
> hereby made that you remedy the noncompliance within 7 days of receipt
> of this notice or your lease shall be deemed terminated and you shall
> vacate the premises upon such termination. If this same conduct or
> conduct of a similar nature is repeated within 12 months, your tenancy
> is subject to termination without your being given an opportunity to
> cure the noncompliance.

In other words, you have one chance to fix it, and if you do you can
stay, but if you break the lease terms again within a year, your lease
will be terminated without the opportunity to fix it.

If it is not a breach that is of a fixable nature (i.e. destruction,
damage, or misuse of the landlord's or other tenants' property by
intentional act or a subsequent or continued unreasonable disturbance,
etc), or you committed a curable breach of lease agreement within the
past 12 months, the landlord will provide the following notice:

> You are advised that your lease is terminated effective immediately.
> You shall have 7 days from the delivery of this letter to vacate the
> premises. This action is taken because (cite the noncompliance) .

If the breach of rental agreement is for **non-payment**, the landlord
can serve you with a 3-day "cure or quit" notice which means you have
three days (excluding weekends and holidays) to pay your rent or leave
the unit.

Once the appropriate time frame is up, and you either haven't paid,
haven't fixed the issue, and you haven't moved out, the landlord will
have to file in court to have you forcibly evicted.

**TL;DR: 3 day notices in Florida are for non-payment. Other lease
terminations not for non-payment result in a 7-day notice. Whether or
not you can stay depends on the violation. Eviction happens when your
lease has been terminated and you haven't moved out, and your landlord
goes to court to get an eviction notice.**
