Yes, but only in very limited circumstances.

You are required by law to provide your real name when police stop and
question you. You are also required to provide your real address and
other real identifying information (but not personally identifying
information like your Social Security Number). Failing to do so is a
separate crime, and you can be held on that charge alone until you can
be identified.

If you enter into a plea agreement with the district attorney, if it
includes testimony, once you have signed on the dotted line, you must
answer their questions as detailed in your agreement, or you risk
terminating your agreement and being prosecuted yourself.

Beyond that, you do not have to say anything. You do not have to give
any information at all. You can even lie if you choose. It\'s not
illegal to lie to the police. It may not help you, but it\'s not a
crime.
