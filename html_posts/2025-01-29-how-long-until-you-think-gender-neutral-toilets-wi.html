It will be a very long time.

Originally, sex separated toilets emanated from the idea that a woman's
place was in the home. In mid-20th century United States, this wasn't a
means to "keep women down," but to "keep women ***protected***", because
the common understanding was that women were the "fairer sex." Because
they were physically weaker, the common thought went, they shouldn't
have to be subjected to the rigors of work outside of the home.

But emanating from that belief (however erroneous it may have been),
allowing women into the workplace meant that they needed to be
"shielded" from the "harsh realities" of the working environment, and
needed a "private retreat" to where they could escape: the women's
restroom. It wasn't to "keep women down." It was to protect the "fairer
sex" from the horrors of the working world.

Indeed, at the time, separate spaces for women were being introduced
throughout society: women's reading rooms were incorporated into public
libraries; separate train cars were established for women, keeping them
in the back to "shield" them in the event of a crash; and the
aforementioned sex separated toilets. The suggested layouts of those
women's retreats/restrooms were designed to mimic the comforts of home
(think curtains and chaise lounges). If you are my age and you managed
to sneak in to some women's restrooms after hours as I did in my youth,
you'd find a much cleaner, better-smelling space (even one I found with
a couch) which actually reflects this aging reality.

Today, they remain, not because of bigotry or systemic sexism, but
**building codes**. Depending on a building's level of occupation, a
certain number of toilets must be provided, and building codes still
specify separate spaces for men and women. In many cases, those building
codes mandate a minimum number of toilets and urinals for each sex.
These building codes often result in more facilities being made
available for men than for women (based on projected occupancy). In some
cases (such as arenas or theaters or auditoriums), the required ratio of
toilets does favor females. However, for the overwhelming majority of
facilities in our day-to-day lives such as nightclubs, restaurants,
retail stores or educational facilities, the ratios are the same across
genders, which has the knock-on effect of the long lines for women's
facilities which have become so ubiquitous in American culture.

The idea that we need to protect women from harm hasn't changed despite
the change in the conversation. That idea has stuck around in American
culture, and the trans bathroom debate has reignited those smoldering
embers when we nearly had them extinguished.

I would hesitate to call it bigotry or sexism when it's really just
cultural affectations which have been incorporated into long-lasting
building codes which are *very difficult* to change and require a great
deal of effort to re-engineer, and a great deal of time to incorporate.
And the desire to protect women hasn't faded, and I doubt that it will
any time soon.

So for non-individual restrooms, I suspect that sex-separated restrooms
will remain for quite some time. Even if a decision was made today to
change them into unisex restrooms, it would still take at least ten
years before you see them being incorporated into new buildings, and
retrofits will take longer still.
