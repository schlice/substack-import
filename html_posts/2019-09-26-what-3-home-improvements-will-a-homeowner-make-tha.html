**What 3 home improvements will a homeowner make that will never pay for
themselves?**

It's a lot easier to list things that you can improve that will
absolutely pay for themselves (exterior upgrades, curb appeal, kitchens,
etc). It's much harder to list things that will never pay off, since any
improvement might hit that right note with one particular buyer.

Nevertheless, there are three improvements that are the *least likely*
to result in a substantial increase in sale price:

- **Bathrooms**. You will typically see less than 50% of a bathroom
  remodel returned in resale value. People know that they don't spend
  much time in the bathroom, so it's less likely to make a huge
  difference. Also, the cost per square foot in a bathroom is high, so
  usually remodeling the bathroom won't get you the big returns you're
  looking for.
- **Adding a room**. Again because of the high cost per square foot,
  adding an addition on to your house is unlikely to see a tremendous
  bump in resale value.
- **Bells and whistles**. That yoga room, that wine cellar, or that
  sauna you just "had to have" may suit you just fine, but it's unlikely
  to raise your home's value. In fact, it may turn buyers off who don't
  want those features, don't want to maintain them, and may cost them
  money in the future to change into something more useful for them.
  Niche additions can be a negative as they may turn off some buyers.
