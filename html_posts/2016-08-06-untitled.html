So your take here is that because you didn\'t see her do anything
\"wrong,\" she shouldn\'t be charged with resisting arrest, because she
shouldn\'t have been arrested in the first place.

What you are describing is a potential legal defense against a false
arrest. If the original arrest is thrown out, then you believe that the
resisting charge should also be thrown out because there was no legal
basis for the original arrest.

The problem here is with who is responsible for determining validity of
arrest. At the scene, the officer is presumed to be right. Whether or
not the original arrest charge gets thrown out is up to a judge. So at
the scene, the law still requires you to follow the lawful orders of a
police officer. Therefore, if we presume the officer is right, you have
no right to resist arrest. Besides, it is a separate law which covers
resisting arrest, and that law does not hinge on the validity of the
arrest, since it cannot be known at the scene whether or not the arrest
charge is valid.

So while the original charge (failure to follow orders and failure to
produce identification) may get thrown out, the resisting charge can
still stand on its own. It\'s a question of safety.
