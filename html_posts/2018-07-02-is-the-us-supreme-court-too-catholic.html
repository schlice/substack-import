**Is the US Supreme Court too Catholic?**

LOL

Seriously, I just got finished laughing. On the other hand, is that a
bad thing? I mean, I don't even think the Catholic Church is *Catholic
enough!*

In any case, the question asks a factually flawed question. Supreme
Court justices are not selected based on their religion; it is
specifically prohibited in the Constitution. Article VI, Paragraph 3
(emphasis mine):

> *The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of
> the several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial
> Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall
> be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution;* ***but
> no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any
> Office or public Trust under the United States.***

So the SCOTUS can never be *too Catholic*, since no religious test is
authorized.
