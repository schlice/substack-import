You're kidding, right? Played?

Here's the reality of the situation: **Trump USED Cruz to unify support
for him!**

Trump *knew* that Cruz was not going to endorse him. By the way, in
**any** other convention for anyone, Bush, Clinton, etc., if you're not
endorsing the candidate, you don't get to speak. Period. If you're not
"in the tank" for the candidate, you don't get anywhere near the stage.
If Bernie Sanders was going to speak at Hillary's convention and *not*
endorse her, do you think he'd be allowed anywhere near that arena?

Not only did the Trump camp know what he was going to do, but did you
happen to notice when Trump entered the arena? It was at the ***precise
moment that Cruz made it clear that he was not going to endorse
Trump!*** The crowd was going nuts, and none of it was for Cruz. Trump
came in and was waving at everyone, and they were going absolutely nuts
after what they had just heard.

And then, Newt Gingrich followed Cruz, and he said (paraphrasing) that
Cruz just said "vote your conscience" and if you truly believe in the
principles of the Republican party, there really is only one ticket you
can vote for that will match your conscience, and that is the
Trump-Pence ticket. That was in Newt's speech, not off-the-cuff. Yet
another indication that this was totally planned.

Cruz is short-selling the Trump campaign, betting Trump is going to lose
the election so that he can say, "See, I'm the only one who was out
there holding to my principles." He's taking a calculated, but very big,
risk. And Republicans do not have short memories. They feel betrayed by
Cruz, so even though it's very clear he's setting himself up for 2020,
it may be over for him before he even begins. This stunt may not have
helped him at all.

If you look at this convention through the lens of a traditional
candidate, you think that Trump got played, he totally didn't expect
this, he was blindsided, etc. But make no mistake, not only was Trump
***not*** played, he ***allowed*** Cruz to go out there and not endorse
him because it helps Trump galvanize support around himself. Some of
those people who were not so warmed-up to Trump are now aligning
themselves with him. Some of those Never Trumpers are now out there
supporting Trump. Cruz did that.

Also, because of the absolute media histrionics (again, free advertising
for Trump) over Cruz's supposed "snub" of Trump at his own convention,
ratings for day four of the RNC convention were through the roof. Cruz
did that, too.

So Cruz's failure to endorse Trump has accomplished two things:

1.  It has galvanized support behind Trump. Some groups which were "on
    the fence" about Trump are now backing him, and others who were
    "kinda" supporting Trump are now fully "in the tank" for him. He has
    done much with the Cruz speech and his own to show that he can speak
    eloquently, and he can deliver a polished speech, and he can level
    factual, substantial indictments of his opponent.
2.  He doesn't need to put hundreds of thousands of dollars into ad
    campaigns. The mainstream media attracts enough attention to Trump
    that he has no need to spend the money. Now that he has officially
    been chosen as the candidate, you will see an all out war against
    Hillary, and if this campaign and convention have shown you
    anything, this will be like nothing you have ever seen before from a
    candidate.

I'll say it again, if you view Trump's campaign through the traditional
lens of politics as usual, you're going to miss everything attracting
people to him. You're going to scratch your head and say, "Why do people
like this buffoon?" You won't get it. You'll look at Cruz's speech and
lack of endorsement and say, "See? He's still a buffoon. He totally got
played."

The number one mistake you can make about Trump is that he's stupid. You
can call him a misogynist, you can call him racist, or bigoted, or what
have you. But don't believe for one second that he's stupid. He didn't
enter that arena exactly when he did by accident. No doubt in my mind,
this whole thing was planned. And the results? The whole thing played
directly in Trump's favor.
