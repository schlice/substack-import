An inheritance was something which was very important during Biblical
times. With few or no opportunities for career advancement, the majority
of people worked in the same trade as their parents. A great desire of
people was to inherit a large sum of money.

What was the "inheritance" that Paul was thinking of? There are two
inheritances for believers. First, we are adopted into God\'s family,
which grants us the right to look forward to an inheritance. Second, we
are granted eternal life with God, "inheriting" all of eternity in His
righteousness.
