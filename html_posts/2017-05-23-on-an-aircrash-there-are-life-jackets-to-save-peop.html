If you land on the ground, you don't need the life jacket.

If you make an emergency landing on the wheels, the doors are equipped
with emergency slides to get you to the ground. On water, those
emergency slides would double as life rafts.

If you make a crash landing **not** on the wheels, and you can walk
away, feel free to take the life jacket with you as a souvenir. Tell
them I said so.
