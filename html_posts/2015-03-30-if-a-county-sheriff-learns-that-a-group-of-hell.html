**Content:** [Were the sheriff\'s deputies to actually stop the bikers
from entering the county, they would be in violation of the 1st
Amendment. Freedom of assembly implies that you can freely use
Federally-funded roads in order to assemble, and traversal within any of
the states in the country is also legally protected as [[Cliff

mentioned.\
\
What might happen is they might get an \"escort\" to ensure their free,
unobstructed movements throughout the county (and surreptitiously
observe their behaviors; what group of fully-law-abiding citizens
wouldn\'t like to have a police escort?). The \"escort\" could ensure
that the gang (especially if it is a large one) doesn\'t impede traffic
and isn\'t impeded itself. The gang isn\'t unlawfully burdened by the
presence of the police escort. So everyone\'s happy.]{.rendered_qtext}
