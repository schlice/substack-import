**When someone is on disability, is the money they're receiving from the
government or from money they put in through their employers?**

The answer is "it depends."

If the person is a disabled veteran (like me), they may receive
compensation from the Veteran's Administration. This is disability
caused by military service, and the government reimburses the veteran
for that disability.

If the person is on "short-term disability" or "long-term disability,"
this is an insurance policy that an employer and an employee pays for
during their active employment. If they are injured to such a degree by
their work that they can no longer work, their disability insurance pays
them. This type of disability is paid by employers (or more accurately,
the employer\'s insurance policy).
