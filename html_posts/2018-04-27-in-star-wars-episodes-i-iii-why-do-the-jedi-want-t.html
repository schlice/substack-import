I think the Jedi know there is a prophecy, but they don't know what it
means. All they know is that they can't fully utilize all aspects of the
Force because they turn every time they try. They must, therefore,
divest themselves of the emotional aspect of their nature, because
delving into emotions puts them at risk for turning.

We know from all aspects of philosophy and logic that you can't have
just one side. A coin will always have a head and a tail. In order to
have light, there must be dark to distinguish it from nothingness. A
front isn't a front without a back. The Jedi know intuitively that they
are supposed to be able to use their logic *and* their emotion when
harnessing the Force, but they just can't figure out how to do it
correctly. They don't exactly know how the Chosen One will bring balance
to the Force. They just know that he is supposed to. They don't even
know how to know who the Chosen One is. They just know that Anakin has a
higher Midichlorian count than any other Jedi ever (including Yoda), and
was possibly fathered by the Midichlorians themselves, and in that case,
must be the Chosen One.

Anakin and Luke can tap into that emotional side of their nature and
harness the power of it while not fully turning. Yoda said that once you
head down the path to the Dark Side, forever will it dominate your
destiny. That wasn't true with Luke (who was able to start down the path
and still resist turning), and it certainly wasn't true with Vader, who
was able to be redeemed at the end of his life, essentially by "turning
back" from the Dark Side, which by all accounts was supposed to be
impossible.

The Jedi also know that the Sith are an anathema. While the Jedi exist
by denying an essential part of their nature but still following the
Order, the Sith *unnaturally* use the Force to do things that were
entirely unintended, such as attempting to cheat death. The Sith are
most definitely not part of the "balance" that the old legend spoke of,
as the Sith drive the Force *out* of balance. So there's the light and
the dark, and then there's the Sith's interpretation of the dark, which
is totally out of whack. So I do believe that balance in the Force means
that the continued presence of the Sith puts the Force into imbalance.
