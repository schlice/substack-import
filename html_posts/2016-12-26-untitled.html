It's not difficult to drive a truck into a crowd of people. In fact,
it's so easy that ISIS is using that tactic (i.e. Nice and Berlin) to
carry out their terror attacks.

Clearly, removing guns from society makes it more difficult to commit a
killing with a gun. If that's all you're trying to do, then removing
guns from all law-abiding citizens will reduce the ability for a
deranged killer to get a gun and kill people with it.

But it does not stop crime, and it does not treat the cause of people
committing crime. It's hardly disingenuous to treat the problem rather
than the symptom. It's pure iceberg theory.

The gun makes it just as easy to murder a 5-year old as it makes it for
an octogenarian to defend himself against a 220 pound assailant, or a
woman to defend herself from a knife-wielding rapist, or a homosexual to
defend himself against a whole truckload of drunken homophobes. The ease
of use is what contributes to the beauty of the weapon. It is exactly
that simplicity which allows anyone to use it so effectively. Because a
person chooses to use it in a way which is wholly unacceptable in
society doesn't make the tool completely ineffective. Because ISIS used
a truck to kill 89 people in Nice shouldn't be a reason to ban trucks.
Their usefulness is well-established. Because you don't see the
usefulness in a gun doesn't mean that it doesn't exist. Thankfully, the
framers saw the usefulness, and protected them in the Constitution.
