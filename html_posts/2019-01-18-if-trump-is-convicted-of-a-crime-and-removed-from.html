**If Trump is convicted a crime and removed from office. Is there a
reasonable chance that Pence will be investigated as possibly being
complicit in any cover-up? If that happened would Pelosi become
president?**

If Pence became president, you could bet dollars to donuts that the
House would shift their investigative focus to him.

Remember, it's Republicans that are the enemy, not just Trump.

However, it's more than likely that President Pence would appoint a Vice
President before he were ever impeached (if Trump's investigation took
years, so too would Pence's). Therefore, that Vice President would
become President.
