It wouldn't happen because Kinder Eggs are marketed to children, and
handguns are illegal to be sold to children for a reason, so it would
shock the conscience, so it would never be approved.

But simply in terms of legality, **if** you could legally import the
Kinder Egg (or maybe do the assembly of the eggs in the US), and **if**
you had a FFL dealer selling the eggs **and** performing background
checks on everyone who buys the eggs, it *might* be legal.

But the mere fact of Kinder Egg (i.e. marketing to kids) blows the whole
thing out of the water, even if you could make it legal.
