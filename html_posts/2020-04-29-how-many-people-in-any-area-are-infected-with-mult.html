**How many people in any area are infected with multiple sclerosis?**

First off, people are not "infected" with MS. It's not a bacterial or
viral infection you can "catch." It's an *autoimmune* condition, where
the body's immune system malfunctions and attacks itself. So people
would be "affected by" MS, or "living with" MS or "diagnosed with" MS.
It's inaccurate to say "infected" with MS.

Anyway, disease rates vary by location. Certain areas and certain
populations have virtually no MS at all, like the Hutterites or the
Inuit or the Yakutes, or Hungarian Romani, Norwegian Lapps, Australian
Aborigines, and New Zealand Maoris.

Disease rates vary also by ethnicity. It is most common among white
women of northern European ancestry (women are two to three times more
likely to develop MS than men).

Even within the United States, some states have a higher incidence of MS
than others, so it's really hard to pinpoint in any area just how many
people have MS.
