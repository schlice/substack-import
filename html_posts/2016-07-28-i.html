I like [[Justin
Styles](https://www.quora.com/profile/Justin-Styles-1)]{.qlink_container}'
answer and the way he phrased it. "\[T\]he Army has entrance standards
that are ...*different*. Not lower, per se, but their mission allows for
them to accept a wider range of candidates."

That's putting it mildly.

Because of their mission type, the Army must admit multiple times the
number of people that the Air Force must admit. The Air Force can
therefore be more selective in their recruitment, necessarily therefore
admitting a higher-scoring component of admissions criteria. So while it
may be untrue, it's worth noting: perception is reality. Because of the
differences in admissions standards, the Army is perceived to be the
"dumber" service. Right or wrong, that's the way it is. There are some
incredibly smart people in the Army, and I take nothing away from them,
but the reality is that perceptions are what they are.

**If you have a choice, go for the Air Force.** Quality of life is
better, treatment of personnel is better, living conditions are better,
facilities are better, the list goes on.

If you have your choice, I would highly recommend the Air Force.
