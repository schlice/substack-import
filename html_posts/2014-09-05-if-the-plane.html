**Content:** [Thanks for the A2A. The \"black box\" is actually two
boxes known as a Flight Data Recorder and a Cockpit Voice Recorder. Both
devices record the information they receive on solid-state storage
media, like flash drives. The FDR records \"telemetry\" information,
such as the aircraft\'s location and \"attitude,\" how it was positioned
in the sky, as well as the settings for all the controls and control
surfaces (flaps, ailerons, rudder, etc). The CVR records all voice
conversations, whether they were broadcast over the radio or not. While
the aircrew is not keying a radio, their headsets and mics are always
on, and they can talk in a normal tone to each other over the noise of
the engines. Those conversations are continually recorded.\

As you can see, the box has an underwater locator beacon attached to the
outside of it, which will ping for as long as its battery still has
charge, so that it can be located underwater. When a plane crashes in
water, essentially a big microphone is placed in the water, listening
for that beacon\'s \"ping\".
