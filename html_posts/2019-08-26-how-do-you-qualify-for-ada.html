**How do you qualify for ADA?**

An individual qualifies for protection under the ADA if they have a
recognized disability.

Remember that this definition of disability is a *legal* one, which
differs from a *medical diagnosis*. A **person with a** **disability**
*under ADA* (which means the legal definition) is defined as a person
who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or
more major life activity. This includes people who have a record of such
an impairment, even if they do not currently have a disability. The
definition also includes individuals who do not have a disability but
are regarded as having a disability.
