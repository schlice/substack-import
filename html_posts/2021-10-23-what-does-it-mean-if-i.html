What does it mean? It means you think that, at 15 years old, that your
life is just so bad that it's not worth saving.

Except for *you haven't even started living your life yet*. You need to
be out of school first before you would even be qualified to make a
judgement like that, and even then, suicide is never the answer.

Society and your parents absolutely deny you freedom and rights. Because
you're still a minor. You still have to do what your parents tell you,
because they are legally responsible for you. And society denies you
specific rights because you are still under 18.

Now, if they are doing something specifically to harm you, then there
may be recourse for you. But planning to kill yourself because your
parents are "denying you rights and freedom" doesn't make too much
sense.

Original question:

What does it mean if I\'m planning to commit suicide to escape my
parents and society denying me freedom and rights? I\'m 15.
