Yes, if your parents call the police to bring you home. **But if you're
worried that your parents will bring you back home after you leave, then
you're not doing it right.**

If you're already living away from your parents, emancipation might be
the right choice for you. Or if you're already working and you want to
be able to manage your own money.

Here's the trick: in order to be able to substantiate an order of
emancipation in Vermont, you have to be living on your own for at least
three months, among other things:

- You are at least 16 years old
- You have lived separate from your parents, custodian, or legal
  guardian for three months or longer
- You are managing your own financial affairs
- You have demonstrated the ability to be self-sufficient in your
  financial affairs and can provide proof of employment or other support
  (\"other support\" does not include general assistance, Reach Up
  benefits, or relying upon the financial resources of someone receiving
  assistance or aid)
- You either hold a high school diploma or are earning a passing grade
  in an educational program approved by the court and directed toward
  the earning of a high school diploma or its equivalent
- You are not under legal guardianship or in the custody of the
  Commissioner of Social and Rehabilitation Services or the Commissioner
  of Corrections
- Your emancipation is in your best interests considering such factors
  as whether you will be able to assume adult responsibilities; your
  adjustment to being on your own; the opinion of your parents,
  custodian, or guardian; and whether the emancipation will create a
  risk of harm to you.[\[1\]](#tQtgH){#cite-tQtgH .citation_link}

So two things stand out to me:

1.  You have to be living on your own for at least three months, if not
    more. If your parents call the police to bring a missing child home,
    you won't be able to claim emancipation because you haven't been on
    your own, handling your own affairs, for three months.
2.  Your parents opinion is part of the consideration of the court as to
    whether or not you will be granted emancipation.

What these two things tell me is that *if you don't have your parents'
cooperation, you'll not be granted emancipation* and will simply have to
wait until you turn 18.

I think this is a great opportunity to have a very meaningful discussion
with your parents about how you can make it on your own, they should
give you the chance, etc. Because if they don't, I can just imagine that
you can make the next two years a pretty hellish experience (as they can
for you as well; those two years won't be fun for any of you). So rather
than go through it that way, it's best to sit down with them and review
your plans and the actual feasibility of them, **and get them to buy in
to your plan.** If you do well for at least three months on your own and
then you meet all of the requirements in Vermont to request legal
emancipation, you should get your parents to agree to allow it.

Sign a contract with them. If you can meet the requirements, they let
you go. If you can't, you agree to stay at home and follow your parents'
rules until you turn 18.

Original question:

Will the police bring me back to my parents if I move out, even if I\'m
safe and self-sufficient? I\'m 16 from Vermont.
