**Is Trump killing his supporters by taking little action to slow the
spread of coronavirus? States with democratic leaders have largely taken
some or a lot of action against the virus while states with republican
leadership have largerly not.**

A few things.

1.  I'm not sure exactly how the virus distinguishes your political
    affiliation before it kills you. So if (and that's a big if) Trump
    did something which is affirmatively killing people, it would kill
    everyone regardless of who that person supports.
2.  Trump is President, not a King. There are a scant few actions he can
    take which states must do. I mean, he could direct the CDC to start
    bullying states to do things, but this isn't right either.\
    \
    I love the hypocrisy:\
    \
    DEMOCRATS: "Trump is actually a fascist dictator!"\
    \
    After Coronavirus hits:\
    \
    DEMOCRATS: "Why isn't Trump acting like more of a fascist dictator?"
3.  I also fail to see what "taking action" has to do with slowing the
    spread of the virus. As other answerers have noted, not all actions
    have been universally good. Allowing infected seniors to return to
    their nursing homes to spread the virus to others was terrible, but
    it still counts as "taking action." Sometimes, not "taking action"
    is better. It just depends on the action. Simply taking action for
    the sake of taking action could lead to disastrous consequences.
