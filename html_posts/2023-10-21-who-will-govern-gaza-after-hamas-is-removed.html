Israel.

I suspect Israel will offer the people in Gaza the same deal they did at
the end of the Six Day War: *if you accept Israel\'s right to exist, if
you accept Israel as the valid authority in this region, you can live in
peace, as full citizens of Israel.* It\'s a good deal. For the Arabs in
the region, they would be the only Arabs in Europe living in an actual
democracy.

And just as after the Six Day War, some will take that deal

But some will not. And in this case, they will be asked to leave. I use
asked loosely. They won\'t actually be asked to leave. They will be
escorted out of the county. Israel can no longer afford to allow them to
remain when all they desire to do is destroy Israel. They have no desire
for peace. They have no desire for compromise.

Just think about the chants that they have been shouting at the pro
Palestinian rallies. "From the river to the sea, Palestine shall be
free.\" Where\'s the river? It\'s the Jordan River, the eastern border
of Israel. Where is the sea? It\'s the Mediterranean Sea, the western
border of Israel. They want nothing more than the complete destruction
of Israel. Israelis can no longer afford such people on their shores.
