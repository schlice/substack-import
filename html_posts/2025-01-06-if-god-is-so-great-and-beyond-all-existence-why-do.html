God is omnipotent. That word means God is *fully complete*. He needs
*nothing*. Because if He needed something, then He would be
*incomplete*. He would be missing something. An "omnipotent" being who
needed something would not be omnipotent. Therefore, God needs nothing,
not the least of which is praise and worship.

We don't worship God because He needs it. *We worship God because He
deserves it.*

So what wonderful thing did God do that makes Him worthy of worship?
**He saved us from ourselves.**

But to understand what happened, you have to know about one of our
greatest design features: **free will.** That feature turned out to be
our downfall when Adam and Eve chose to reject Him and break His rules.
That act *broke* us. But He wanted us to have that ability to make free
choices, because He wanted us to freely be able to choose Him, warts and
all. It is this ability to make free choices, **even the ability to
reject truth**, which makes us moral creatures and gives us the ability
to choose our ultimate destiny.

So we broke that relationship with God through our own sin. That sin
separated us from God. A perfect and holy God does not accept sin in His
Kingdom, so that sin separates us from Him.

So God sent Jesus to take on Himself the punishment for our sin. Jesus'
sacrifice took all of our sin (past, present, and future) and reconciled
us to God.

But lest you think that God cruelly sent a patsy to do His dirty work
and to suffer to "fix His creation", it's important to remember that
**Jesus is God.**

So ultimately, **God took upon Himself the punishment that we deserve,
so that we could be reunited with Him.**

Now, we have a restored relationship with Him. Our free will is intact.
We can freely choose to love Him or reject Him without violating our
freedom. And that freedom is crucial, because love can only be freely
given; it can never be coerced. God could never force us to love Him. He
needs us to do so freely.

In other words, He built the perfect system to allow us to make the
choice to love Him. While He will always pursue us, He will never coerce
us.

And it is for that reason that He deserves our praise. He deserves our
worship. We don't worship Him because He needs it. We worship Him
because He deserves it, for what He's done for us.

I'm reminded of the words to the song:

*What He's done, what He's done,\
All the glory and the honor to the Son!\
My sins are forgiven,\
My future is Heaven,\
I praise God for what He's done!*
