1.  Accept the free watering and adjust your own watering accordingly.
2.  Notify the HOA that there is a misaligned sprinkler so that they can
    contact their landscaper to fix the sprinkler alignment
3.  Realign the sprinkler yourself. It's not that difficult. Just don't
    break it; if you do, you'll be responsible to pay for fixing it.
