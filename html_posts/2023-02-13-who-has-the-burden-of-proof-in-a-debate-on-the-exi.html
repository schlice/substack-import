The burden of proof lies with the one making the claim.

So if I make the claim that God exists, I must back it up with some
evidence.

If you make the claim that God does not exist, you similarly must back
it up with evidence.

> **What are some arguments that can be used in this regard?**

I can only speak for making the claim that God exists. I can't prove
that God does not exist --- no one can. Author and philosopher Mortimer
Adler said, "An affirmative existential proposition can be proved, but a
negative existential proposition---one that denies the existence of some
thing---cannot be proved."

Making the claim that God exists involves using logic and reason
(inductive reasoning). Most of what we know today, we know through
inductive reasoning, or induction. And induction can never be 100%
proven, it can only be highly likely. Or as we say in the legal world,
**true beyond a reasonable doubt**.

To make the proof that God exists, you must first ask the right
question, and that question, the most basic question in the universe, is
***why am I here?*** Why do I exist, instead of nothing at all? First of
all, I know I exist. I know I am not an illusion, and I know that I am
not self-existent (eternal). Therefore, my existence must have a
*cause*. Everything that has a beginning has a cause. Even the outspoken
atheist David Hume said, "I never asserted so absurd a proposition as
that something should arise without a cause." From that, we derive the
**Law of Causality**, which states that very principle: *everything that
has a beginning has a cause.*

So logically, what we know so far:

- Something exists.
- You can't get Something from nothing, and you are not self-caused.
- Therefore, some necessary and eternal entity caused us to exist.

Even the atheists do not deny this logic. They simply claim that the
universe is that eternal cause. However, to date, all scientific and
philosophical knowledge tells us that the universe had a beginning.
You've probably heard of the Big Bang, right? Yeah, that was the start
of the universe. And if it had a beginning, it had a cause, and is
therefore not eternal.

So continuing our logic from above:

- The only two sources of eternality are an eternal universe, or an
  eternal creator.
- The universe had a beginning, and is not eternal.
- Therefore, an eternal creator exists.

If you want to disprove one of these logical statements, you must do so
with evidence, as each of these statements has its own evidence.

You can come up with *hypotheses* about things like sources of
eternality (maybe the universe continually expands and contracts
eternally), but you must provide some evidence for this, since all
evidence to date says that the universe exploded into existence out of
nothing, and before that, nothing existed, not time, space, or matter.
So if you are going to say that something existed before the Big Bang,
you have to explain how Einstein's Theory of General Relativity is wrong
when it proves that all time began at the Big Bang.

So there you have it, a basic proof for the existence of a creator being
we call God. Now this doesn't say anything about the type of god it is,
or any other details, it's just the logical set of proofs which get us
to the point which proves that a god exists.
