**Content:** []{.rendered_qtext}

Because no one can agree on what "evidence" is acceptable. The
"evidence" that is acceptable to some is completely useless to others.

So it's not about the evidence. It's about what evidence you would find
acceptable.

To check yourself, change the sentence thusly, and think about how you
would answer it:

> **Why do Alexander the Great mythicists deny every piece of evidence
> that a historical Alexander the Great existed?**

Then answer this question for yourself. Once you're done, look at the
evidence and ask yourself: *why is the evidence suitable for Alexander
the Great, but not for Jesus?*
