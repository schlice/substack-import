All they see is "not Trump."

They'd literally vote for a chimpanzee in a suit, so long as it was
running against Trump. The largest majority of the Democrat party is
really only voting for Biden because he\'s not Trump.

Their hatred for Trump runs *so deep* that they\'d be willing to abuse
an elderly man so that Trump will not re-enter the White House.

It\'s too bad that Nikki Haley didn\'t win the nomination. Because if it
was Haley versus Biden in that last debate, not only would she have
mopped the floor with him, November would be a landslide victory for
her. But because it\'s Trump, it\'s still going to be close.

As I have always said, Trump\'s biggest problem is Trump. If he could
just get out of his own way, he\'d be a good president. As it is, he\'s
got good policies, but he\'s not a great person. So most of us have to
hold our nose and vote for Trump so that we get the good policies. The
country is more important than the man.

For the Democrats, apparently, the man is more important than the
country.
