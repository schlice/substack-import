First of all, you are slightly inaccurate. Federal prosecutors have
filed charges against at least 600 people in connection with the January
6 riot at the Capitol. Not all of them have been convicted. The vast
majority of these have been charged with unlawfully entering or
remaining in a restricted area, property damage, and other minor crimes.
Most of those have simply pled guilty to minor charges and walked away
without doing any jail time.

Because they weren't there. They didn't unlawfully enter or remain in
restricted areas. They didn't cause property damage. They didn't resist
arrest.

Trump, especially, did what politicians do: *he riled up his base*. Was
this a wise thing for him to do? Probably not. But it's par for the
course from a man who we called a "maverick" and a "political outsider"
from day one. And it is not illegal. Far from it; it is Constitutionally
protected speech. Political speech is even more protected than most.
