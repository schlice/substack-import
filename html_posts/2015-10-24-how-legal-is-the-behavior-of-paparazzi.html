**Content:** [Paparazzi often try to get photos that are just a hair\'s
breadth shy of illegal invasion of privacy. They will do it in any way
that they can, because they want to be the one that snaps that one
picture that everyone wants to buy.\
\
But while any person is out in public, they can be photographed or
recorded. You have no expectation of privacy when you are outside your
home. Even if you\'re inside your home, if you\'re standing by an open
window, you can be photographed. You have no expectation of privacy when
your blinds are not drawn.\
\
Some things they do are clearly illegal: you can\'t obstruct someone\'s
movement in public. You can\'t incite a riot, either by your words or
your actions. That\'s why celebrities have bodyguards. They keep the
paparazzi on the right side of the law.\

privacy.]{.rendered_qtext}
