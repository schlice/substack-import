**Would you give up your 2nd amendment rights to bring back one police
officer killed in the line of duty?**

Nice, a clever twist on the "[[false
dilemma](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5c946b&url=https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/black-or-white){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="yourlogicalfallacyis.com"}]{.qlink_container}" logical
fallacy intermixed with the "[[false
equivalence](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=22885e&url=https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/false-cause){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="yourlogicalfallacyis.com"}]{.qlink_container}" logical
fallacy.

The False Dilemma: If you don't give up your rights, you're a monster
because you don't want to bring dead cops back to life. If you do vote
to bring dead cops back to life, the Second Amendment is meaningless
because you don't choose to fight for it.

The False Equivalence: You presume by your question that giving up your
2nd Amendment rights will somehow mean that cops won't get killed by
criminals, when there is no such equivalence.

Your question is loaded with logical fallacies, which makes it
unanswerable.
