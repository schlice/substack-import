**Content:** [You would have to wear something that the darts will
bounce off of. So you must be wearing a suit of Teflon, or some sort of
armor. Chain mail won\'t work, as the darts can catch on the chain and
then electrify the entire suit. I suspect that if your chain mail was
grounded and you were insulated from the suit, that might do the trick.\

OK, so spend the rest of your life walking around in chain mail to stop
the TASER, and you\'ve just bought yourself a one-way ticket to force
escalation.]{.rendered_qtext}
