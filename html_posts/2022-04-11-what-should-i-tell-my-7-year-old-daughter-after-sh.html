This is a great time to introduce the basics of gun safety to your
child.

You really shouldn't need to go into the "sometimes killing is
acceptable" schtick because it's a bit beyond the 7 year old mind. For
now, you can tell your 7 year old that guns are tools, but they can be
very dangerous if they are not used correctly. If you ever see one:
**stop, don't touch, leave the area,** and **tell an adult**.

By the way, I shamelessly stole that from the NRA's Gun Safety Program,
with Eddie Eagle. This would be a really really good time to [[introduce
your child to Eddie

Original question:

What should I tell my 7 year old daughter after she asked me \"Why do
guns exist?\" after seeing an ultra-violent scene in a movie playing on
TV (over which I had no control)? Besides \"to kill\" I don\'t know what
to say.
