in order to qualify as a service dog, a dog has to be trained to treat a
specific condition caused by a recognized disability. PTSD is a
recognized disability. A dog specifically trained to treat a condition
caused by PTSD qualifies as a service dog under ADA.

Business owners can ask you whether or not your dog is trained to treat
a specific condition caused by a recognized disability, and what the dog
is trained to do. That\'s all they\'re allowed to ask you. Your dog does
not need any papers, it doesn\'t need to wear a special harness, or
anything. You'll see lots of dogs wearing vests; a vest does not make a
dog a service animal. I also see emotional support animals wearing
vests; this also does not make them acceptable under ADA. The dog must
be trained to treat a specific condition caused by a recognized
disability.
