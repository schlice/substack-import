**Content:** [September 11th is not a federal holiday; it is a national
day of mourning. As written by my colleague and friend [[Bill
Petro](https://www.quora.com/profile/Bill-Petro)]{.qlink_container} on
his

With the following words and many others, **President George W. Bush**
designated September 11 to be regarded as **Patriot Day**, or ***America
Remembers***:\

]{.rendered_qtext}

> *By the President of the United States of America*\
> A Proclamation\
> On this first observance of Patriot Day, we remember and honor those
> who perished in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. We will
> not forget the events of that terrible morning nor will we forget how
> Americans responded in New York City, at the Pentagon, and in the
> skies over Pennsylvania --- with heroism and selflessness; with
> compassion and courage; and with prayer and hope. We will always

> that freedom prevails, and that the principles upon which our Nation
> was founded endure.\

The President inaugurated this observance on September 4, 2002 and
repeated it the next year, following a joint resolution approved
December 18, 2001 along with the US Congress, intending that it be
firmly planted into the consciousness of the American people, and each
year recalled to our memory "that more than 3,000 innocent people lost
their lives when a calm September morning was shattered by terrorists
driven by hatred and destruction" on September 11, 2001.
