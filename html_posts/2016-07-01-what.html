Well, I'm due for a few bonus points, so here goes.

The United States Military Academy at West Point was originally an Army
fort. General Washington considered West Point to be the most important
strategic position in America. He personally selected Thaddeus
Kosciuszko, one of the heroes of Saratoga, to design the fortifications
for West Point in 1778, and Washington transferred his headquarters to
West Point in 1779. Continental soldiers built forts, batteries and
redoubts and extended a 150-ton iron chain across the Hudson to control
river traffic. Fortress West Point was never captured by the British,
despite Benedict Arnold\'s treason. West Point is the oldest
continuously occupied military post in America. It was converted to a
military academy in 1802 by President Thomas Jefferson. It was West
Point that defined military education for officers, setting it as the
"first step" in a litany of education for officers to partake of during
their careers.[\[1\]](#BhmoK){#cite-BhmoK .citation_link}

In stark contrast, the Air Force Academy is different in almost every
way from West Point. It is, far and away, the youngest academy (as is
the military service for which it trains and recruits new officers). The
Academy was envisioned almost immediately after the Air Force became a
separate service in 1947. A board was assembled in 1948 to start the
process of reviewing Army and Navy academies to understand what was
needed in an Air Force Academy. On April 1st, 1954, Congress authorized
the construction of an Air Force Academy (and by the way, the irony is
not lost on us that our Academy was authorized on April Fool's Day). The
Air Force was already well prepared for that day. The curriculum was
already in development at Maxwell AFB several years before. The site in
Colorado was selected because of its isolated location, yet still close
enough to large towns, good weather for training, and not the least of
which that the state of Colorado offered to contribute US\$1 Million
towards the purchase of the land. In the same year that construction for
the new Academy began (1955), the first class of 306 men was sworn in at
a temporary Academy location at Lowry AFB in Denver. On 29 Aug 1958, the
wing of 1145 cadets took up residence at their now-permanent location on
Academy property. The first class graduated in 1959.

As for interesting traditions, I can tell you that West Point has *far
more* interesting traditions than we do, simply because we didn't have
time to develop them. But I will fill you in on the one item which could
be considered as close as you can come to a "secret handshake" for Air
Force Academy grads. We have a form at the Academy called USAFA Form
0--96 (that's pronounced "Oh-Dash-Nine-Six"), the "Cadet Food
Acceptability Report."

Except that it's not used as an actual "food acceptability report." It's
used to teach military form writing skill, how to correct mistakes on a
military form, to always carry a pen, and how to provide the "correct"
answer, which occasionally is not always the "right" answer. I know that
seems strange, but [[read this blog

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="thestrategybridge.com"}]{.qlink_container} and you'll get a
better idea of what I mean. Anyway, the "correct" answers for the top of
the form are "Fast, neat, average, friendly, good, good." Regardless of
the actual quality of the meal (which is always exceptional, by the
way), the "correct" answers are always the same.

The tale is told that during the Vietnam Conflict, a downed Academy
graduate did not have (or could not remember) the correct answers for
his security authentication in order to be picked up by rescue craft.
When the chopper pilot (also a grad) heard that the downed pilot was a
grad, he radioed, "Authenticate fast neat average." When the downed
pilot replied, "Friendly good good," he was picked up and returned home.
