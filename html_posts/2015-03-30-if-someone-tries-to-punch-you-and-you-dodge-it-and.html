**Content:** [[[Cliff
G.](https://www.quora.com/profile/Cliff-G-13)]{.qlink_container} is of
course correct. If you had asked \"If someone tries to punch you and you
dodge it and then you take out a gun and shoot him, will you be charged
for murder?\" this would be an example of using a higher level of force
than necessary to meet the threat and would probably not be covered
under self-defense. You probably wouldn\'t be charged with murder, but
you might be charged with voluntary manslaughter. But this too varies by
jurisdiction. There are exceptions though, especially a very large
difference in size (i.e. you\'re extremely small and your attacker is
extremely large), where using a gun could still be considered valid
self-defense. The short answer is \"it depends on the laws in your
jurisdiction\"\
\
In your scenario, you met a punch/kick with a punch/kick. This would
probably be considered equal force and would probably be valid as
self-defense. Exceptions might be if you were militarily trained or
trained in martial arts. These people actually know how to kick someone
and kill them. That death-by-kick may not be defensible as
self-defense.]{.rendered_qtext}
