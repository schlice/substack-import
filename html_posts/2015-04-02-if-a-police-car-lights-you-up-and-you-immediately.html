**Content:** [The law doesn\'t say \"immediately slam on your brakes
when you see police lights behind you.\" The law says you must \"yield\"
to flashing lights and sirens behind you. That means you pull over so
the officer can pass, or you pull over so the officer can have a chat
with you, but either way, the law says you pull over.\
\
Since there is no provision in the law that allows you to slam on your
brakes and allow a police car to hit you, you would likely be at fault
for causing a dangerous driving condition.]{.rendered_qtext}
