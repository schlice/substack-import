**As a pro-lifer, what do you think about a rape victim that wants to
have an abortion?**

As a pro-lifer, it is literally the only time I would be willing to even
discuss the possibility of abortion, or when the life of the mother is
threatened by a continued pregnancy.

But we are discussing rape right now, so let's stick with that. Here are
a few points to consider:

1.  Yes, the rape victim (we're assuming it's a woman) is a victim here.
    ***But so is the baby***. Does it make much logical sense to take
    someone else's life because you are the victim of a crime? That baby
    is as much of a victim as the woman. And the only thing that allows
    you to kill the baby is its location. Let's say (as sick and twisted
    as this is) that the rapist brought his 6 month old daughter with
    him while he raped that woman. Would it still be okay to kill that 6
    month old girl because a woman was raped? Of course not. So why is
    it okay to kill one victim because another person was a victim too?
2.  The reason why I will compromise my own principles in the case of
    rape is because first of all, I know that only about 1% of abortions
    are a result of rape (and not every woman who is raped chooses to
    abort her baby; it's around 50% of women who are impregnated during
    a rape who choose to terminate their pregnancies). In order to get
    an abortion then, a woman must report a rape. The police must
    investigate, and they must conclude, at the very least, that she's
    not lying. So this has the dual effect of correcting the
    under-reporting of rape, and saving lots and lots of lives. I'm
    willing to compromise my own principles and save 99% of babies
    instead of holding fast to my principles and not saving any.
3.  I fully understand that if we even entertain the idea of restricting
    elective abortions, we must massively change the adoption
    infrastructure in this country. We must make it *dead simple* to
    both give up a baby for adoption, and also for parents to adopt a
    baby. The amount of red tape to adopt an American baby is ludicrous.
    Parents know they have a better chance to actually adopt a baby if
    they go overseas to do so, to China or Russia or the Philippines.
    This must end. However, we still must ensure that we are not
    allowing people to merely adopt children so that they can benefit
    from tax breaks and other federal assistance. I want adoption to be
    safe and easy, and not become a cash cow to unscrupulous foster
    parents. We absolutely can do both, and we can do it much faster
    than we do now. It will take great efforts on the part of the
    federal government, and a whole lot of cash, and we are currently
    short on both of those today. Thanks, COVID.

*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.
Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a
civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not
misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously. My mental well-being
isn\'t worth your harassing, inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I
wrote, tough shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is
un-cited opinion masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m
wrong, write your own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site,
not a debate site. If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually,
you\'re wrong,\" don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment.
Put anything vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be
followed by a block and a mute, and a BNBR report. I will do this
immediately and with no compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*
