You have started with a strawman argument without any proof. There is
zero evidence to support your statement that *even some* police officers
feel like they can harm citizens and not face punishment. So to answer
your question, we're not going to spend the hundreds of millions of
dollars to invent a second force to protect citizens from the police
when there is absolutely zero evidence that we even need one.

Now that the answer is out of the way, let's discuss some of the reasons
why we don't need what you're asking for.

First of all, police are under far more scrutiny than civilians, and
they are very well aware of that fact. Where a civilian only faces the
judicial system, police face review by the judicial system for
violations of law, a review board within the department looking for
violations of police policy (not law), as well as (these days) potential
review by the US Department of Justice for violations of civil rights.
What other profession is so scrutinized? Also, how many other
professions are being recorded all the time? With the advent of cell
phones with embedded cameras, everyone can record at any time, and
people love to record the police, just waiting for them to screw up just
a little bit to get their 15 minutes of YouTube fame and a few more
likes and subscribes. Police generally presume that every time they step
out of the cruiser, someone is recording them. With that kind of
scrutiny, no officer in his right mind would ever presume that they
could harm someone without punishment.

Secondly, there were some officers a few decades ago who had this
mindset, but the nature of the police force is changing. New officers
coming on board grew up in a much more "sensitized" environment, where
ensuring people's "feelings" are protected is just as important as
enforcing the law. Officers who were trained in the environments in the
70's and 80's are retiring. So naturally, those old, bigoted attitudes
which existed are on their way out anyway.

Finally, and this is important, no one is saying that it won't happen,
or that police are somehow immune to that sentiment. Sometimes, officers
with those preconceived ideas about police superiority will slip through
the screening process, or some young officer will be mentored by one of
those older, bigoted officers, and will pick up some of those attitudes
towards those they serve. It has happened, and it will continue to
happen, but it will happen less often as we go forward, not more often.
There are lots of police officers, and since police come from society,
and we acknowledge that those attitudes exist in society, they will
exist (albeit to a lesser degree) in our police force.

So the need for such a protective force is simply not there.
