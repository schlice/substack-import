**Can my employer force me to wear a seat belt in my personal vehicle?**

Yes, if you drive your personal vehicle for work. Your employer can
"force" you by requiring you to do so, and then firing you if you fail
to do so (i.e. you get pulled over and are given a citation for failing
to wear a seat belt).

I mean, they can't really "force" you to wear your seat belt. However,
they can condition your continued employment on you not being pulled
over for a seat belt violation.
