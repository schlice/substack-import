When you bought your house, you would have signed the Governing
Documents for the HOA in that big stack of papers you signed. Therefore,
your deed would reflect that your home is part of a Homeowner's
Association.

You can check with your County Property Appraiser's office to retrieve a
copy of your deed as filed with them, and it will indicate whether or
not your home is part of an HOA. In fact, simply pulling the electronic
records of your property on file with the County Appraiser's office
should show clearly if the property is part of an HOA.
