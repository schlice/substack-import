**Content:** [Look, I see where you\'re getting at.\
\
\"Have guns been proven to reduce police mortality?\"\
\"No, no such tests have ever been done, or are even conceivable.\" (see
[[Tim Dees](https://www.quora.com/profile/Tim-Dees)]{.qlink_container}\'
answer)\
\"Then why are police officers armed if it has never been proven that
guns actually keep police officers safe?\"\
\
The answer is police officers are not armed to keep them safe. Police
officers are armed to keep ***YOU*** safe.\
\
When they face a threat to ***YOUR*** life or safety, they can employ
firearms to stop that threat.]{.rendered_qtext}
