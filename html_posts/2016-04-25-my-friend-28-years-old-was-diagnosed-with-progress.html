**Content:** [Be a good friend. Be an ear to listen, be a shoulder to
lean on. Your friend is going to be experiencing many different
emotions, so you can best serve your friend by not judging, and
understand that your friend is going to be confused, angry, and scared.
Keep your friend grounded. MS is not a death sentence, but it will
change their life.]{.rendered_qtext}
