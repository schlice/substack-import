<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [This is the sentiment we try to make clear to the anti-gun
crowd which equates \"no guns\" with \"no crime\". Britain\'s no-gun
policy hasn\'t helped to eliminate knife crimes, and if you can\'t own a
knife, someone will beat you with a baseball bat (er, a cricket bat),
and if you can\'t own that, they\'ll beat you with a frying pan, or a
rock, or a metal pipe.\
\
The point we\'re trying to make (and the one you are helping us to make)
is that the *tool* used to commit the crime is irrelevant; the crime
will still happen regardless of what tool is actually
used.]{.rendered_qtext}
