They'd never make it near enough to the United States mainland to even
see the beach.

I've answered a similar question a while back:

[[Bill Stein\'s answer to If an unidentified passenger plane flew into
the American mainland and ignored all attempts at communicating with it,
how would the military
respond?](/If-an-unidentified-passenger-plane-flew-into-the-American-mainland-and-ignored-all-attempts-at-communicating-with-it-how-would-the-military-respond/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container}

This answer has all the details about the ADIZ which I'm going to
reference.

If an invasion force of aircraft was headed towards the ADIZ, we would
immediately launch our NORAD quick response assets to intercept and
visually identify the attackers. Your invasion force would be met 200
nautical miles off the coast of the United States. They would be given
ample opportunity to declare their intentions, and continuing on their
existing heading would be considered a declaration of war.

Once it was determined that China was openly sending an invasion force
towards the mainland of the US, the National Command Authority would
approve the destruction of that invasion force.

So what would happen? You'd make it 9/10ths of the way to the United
States and die in a fiery plane crash into the Pacific Ocean.

From that point forward, China would have some explaining to do in order
to avoid full-on war.
