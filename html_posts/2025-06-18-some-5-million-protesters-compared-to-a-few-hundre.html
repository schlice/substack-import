Apples to oranges comparison.

As opposed to one single parade in DC for the Army, the protests were
funded by the Democrat party. No fewer than 70 Democrat focused
organizations organized protests in 19 states, funded their operations,
***paid people to be there***, and provided logistics support. In
addition, well-organized violent agitators also attended these same
protests, in secret, outside of the work done by the organizers of the
protests. These violent agitators basically hijacked any peace in
"peaceful protests" and turned them into violent riots. So much for
"peaceful" protesting.

Anyway, the organizers failed miserably, for multiple reasons:

- The unfortunately-named "No Kings" protests just didn't land with
  people. The day after the protests, we all woke up and, miraculously,
  we were still not ruled by a king. So...congratulations? You got what
  you wanted?
- The irony of the whole "No Kings" protest on the same day as the 250th
  birthday of the US Army was clearly lost on the organizers, as the
  only reason you can peacefully protest and not be immediately arrested
  is because the Constitution was preserved by the Army.
- It should also be noted that if the US were actually ruled by a king,
  a protest titled "No Kings" would not be permitted. So the very idea
  of a "No Kings" protest existing belies the idea that the US is run by
  a king.

> **were there any celebrations of Trump\'s birthday (like the MAGA
> election-celebrations across the country)?**

So since you are apparently comparing the "No Kings" protest to Trump's
birthday (because I guess everything is about Trump), no, there were no
large-scale birthday celebrations anywhere in the US for Trump's
birthday.

Because, as we have noted throughout this answer, Trump is not a king.
If he was, we'd be celebrating him as if he were a king, but since he is
just a political office holder, we don't celebrate him as we would for a
king, with kingdom-wide celebrations.

*Election* celebrations, on the other hand, are quite common and were
widespread the day after the election. Elections are politically and
emotionally charged, so some revelry is expected after an election.
