Lots of hugs, some tears, lots of pictures, probably lots of adult
beverages, etc.

Once the ceremony is done, the newly-minted Second Lieutenants usually
have a little bit of leave left over (around a week or so). Following
that, they ship out to their first duty assignment, which is normally
some form of tech school to start their new jobs. If they are pilots,
there is usually a little more downtime before UPT begins, but that's
generally how it goes.

They already have their personal effects boxed up and ready to leave,
and Transportation will ship them to their next duty station.

Transportation will also coordinate their transport to their next duty
station. If available, they will fly on military transport directly to
their next duty station. If not, tickets will be provided for civilian
air transport.

There's been a famous meme that has been running around the Academy for
decades that the best view of the Academy is the one in your rear-view
mirror. It's certainly an amazing feeling to see that, and consciously
or subconsciously, everyone takes an extra-long look in their rear-view
mirror after they have graduated and are literally leaving the base for
the last time. But it doesn't last.
