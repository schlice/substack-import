*(US answer only)*

If person A believes that his life is in danger, or he is in danger of
grave bodily harm, he can use whatever force he has at his disposal,
***up to and including deadly force***, to defend his life.

This is known in the United States as **the right to self-defense.**

Now, every state has different rules around the use of force, and what
justifies it, and when can you use it, etc., but nearly every state is
similar in that you have the right to defend your life if you are in
fear of losing it.

Original question:

If person A attacks person B and B gets the upper hand and begins
beating person A to a pulp, does person A have the right to defend
himself with a gun if he had one?
