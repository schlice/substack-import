**Content:** [More social services are great, but there are limits to
government benevolence.\
\
For example, the government could do so much more in the United States
to help the mentally ill. We are ignoring a problem which, I think, goes
much deeper than most people understand. There are so many different
levels of mental health issues; most people are totally functional and
have some level of mental health issue. If there wasn\'t such a stigma
surrounding mental health, we\'d make far more progress. The government
could do so much more to furthering that discussion, and adding more
social programs would be something that would benefit many, many
people.\
\
But on the flip side, we throw so much money at education, and we\'re
not seeing the ROI from that money. We will approve any tax increase on
the ballot as long as the word \"education\" is tied to it. We have
steadily increased spending on education over the last 20 years, yet
student achievement has been essentially flat. Throwing more money at
education doesn\'t help.\
\
Finally, I\'d mention that our National Parks Service says don\'t feed
the animals because doing so \"will make them dependent\" on those
handouts and they will never learn to feed themselves. From the
[[National Park
Service](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d73554&url=http://www.nps.gov/grca/learn/nature/wildlife_alert.htm){.external_link

dead animal.\"\
\
There\'s a lot of truth to that statement.]{.rendered_qtext}
