Along with [[Chaplain

excellent answer, I used to have the same problem with people taking
"smoke breaks." It was a bit unfair, no? I mean, I didn't smoke at the
time, so how did they get to leave their duty stations for 15 minute
smoke breaks while I didn't?

The answer: I was just as permitted to take "fresh air" breaks at the
same interval as they were to take "smoke breaks."

Sundays are time off for just about everyone who had a M-F 9--5 job in
the military. How you choose to spend your Sunday mornings is up to you.
You can use that time to attend church services if you like, or you can
just take that time to relax and unwind.

When it came to positions which were 24x7, sometimes the mission takes
priority and you have to work on a Sunday. Christians and other
believers understand and accept this, so long as accommodations are made
when building schedules for predicted work.
