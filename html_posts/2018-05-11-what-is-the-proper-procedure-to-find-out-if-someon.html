**What is the proper procedure to find out if someone is a confidential
informant before dealing with them?**

So perhaps I'm confused. You're wanting to know how you find out if
someone is a CI for a Federal or State law enforcement entity before you
"deal with them?"

If I'm reading that correctly, the short answer is ***you can't***.

CI's are protected informants. Only the CI and the "handler" know that
they are participating in the program. Not only does no one else know,
even if they did, they would never reveal that information as it is
protected as part of an ongoing investigation. The only time anyone
outside of those two will find out is when the CI takes the stand in a
courtroom.

Otherwise, *you will never know.*

The moral of the story: this is one of the risks when "dealing" with
other people. Perhaps you should ensure that your "dealings" are
above-board. So long as what you're doing is legal, whether or not the
person you are dealing with is a CI will make no difference whatsoever.
