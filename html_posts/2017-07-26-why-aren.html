I only want to address the Constitutional issue here. Personally, I
believe that if you want to *carry* your gun off of your property, you
should meet high standards of training. But that's not what the OP
asked. The question was

> *Why aren't citizens who want guns in the US required to have high
> standards of training?*

What other products are you required to receive high standards of
training on before you purchase them? You don't need a license to
**buy** a car, you only need a license to **drive** a car. I know, you
presume that if you buy a car, you're going to drive a car, but I have
heard of at least one person who never had a license buying a car. He
can't *drive* that car, but he can *buy* a car.

We do have some requirements for **buying** a gun: you can't be a felon,
you can't be an adjudicated mental defective, etc., but those
restrictions are the least restrictive possible and serve a compelling
state interest. We have far greater restrictions and requirements
(including training requirements) if you want to **conceal** a firearm,
but we have yet to enact those same standards in all places for someone
who wishes to **carry** a firearm. It's very disjointed. Some states
allow all people who can legally own a gun to carry that gun openly,
some states do not. Most states allow concealed carry if training and
certification requirements are met, some states do not.

So I think the problem you are facing is that you misunderstand the
question. You don't necessarily need high standards of training to buy a
gun, nor should you. Cars are demonstrably more dangerous than guns, and
you don't even need a license to buy one. You do need a license to drive
one, but not to buy one. Same thing with guns. You don't need a license
to buy one, but you may need a license to carry one. Licenses involve
training.
