<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

I don't generally answer anonymous commenters unless it's some sort of
sensitive discussion, but this made me laugh, Immigration is not law?
Perhaps you should re-read the Constitution, Anonymous Respondent. And
the President's executive action was not guidance on how to execute
existing law. It was \*new\* guidance that does not exist in current
law. The President cannot write law, only Congress can write law. And
therefore, his unlawful executive action was stayed.

Yes, the better way would indeed be to follow the law and go through the
proper procedure if you are dissatisfied with a law. Like perhaps going
to the people who, oh, I don't know, **write the laws** and petitioning
them to, oh, I don't know, **change the law**.

What the President and liberal Democrats fail to understand is that
*inaction by Congress does not mean failure to act. Inaction is, in and
of itself, an action*. Failing to pass a law means that there is not
enough political will to get it passed, which means that **the people**
are not behind it. And so Congress *chooses*, consciously, to do
nothing.

When the President says, "I'm acting because Congress failed to act,"
this is faulty logic, is self-serving, and as the Supreme Court ruled
today, is unlawful.
