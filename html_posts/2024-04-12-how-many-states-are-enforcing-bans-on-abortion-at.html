As of April 8, 2024, there are 15 states which completely ban abortion
at all stages, with very limited exceptions.

As of April 8, 2024, Georgia and Florida are the only states which ban
abortion after only six weeks of pregnancy. Other limited abortion
states include North Carolina, Utah, Nebraska, and Arizona, but they are
all somewhere between six and fifteen weeks.

Florida is unique because their state supreme court upheld the
constitutionality of a 15-week ban, but the state passed a 6-week ban
which would only go into effect if and when the state supreme court
found that the 15-week ban was constitutional.
