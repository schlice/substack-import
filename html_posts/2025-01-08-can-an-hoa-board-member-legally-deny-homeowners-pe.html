In concept, yes. Not in actual practice.

An HOA board member, acting alone, cannot deny a homeowner permission to
sell their property.

However, the HOA (as an entity) will report to title company whether or
not the seller is "in good standing" with the HOA (i.e. their account is
current and there are no past due balances on the account). In many
states, you cannot complete the sale of a house if the owner is in
arrears with the HOA.

Please note that this varies by state. In many states, you cannot
process the sale of your home until the HOA reports that your account is
settled, but in nearly all cases, the HOA will provide a Statement of
Account to the title company which clearly shows that the HOA is due
money to be paid out of the proceeds of the sale. The title company will
ensure that the account is returned to good standing before any proceeds
are paid to the seller.
