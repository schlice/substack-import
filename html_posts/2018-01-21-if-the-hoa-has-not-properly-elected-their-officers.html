**If the HOA has not properly elected their officers, can we get rid of
it since nothing has been properly registered since it\'s release from
the developer? It is only 7 homes & 1 nut.**

said, the Board that is in place is likely the Board that was installed
by the developer when the HOA was turned over to the homeowners. From
here on out, the HOA must follow the Director election process as laid
out in the Governing Documents. An election is not necessary at initial
stand-up of the HOA; generally, the developer installs a Board of
Directors which will serve until the first mandated election.

Additionally, you cannot "get rid" of an HOA. HOAs are legal entities
registered with the City. If you no longer want your HOA, you will need
to **dissolve** it, which is a legal process. You generally need 3/4 of
the homeowners to vote to dissolve the HOA. If your HOA only consists of
seven homes, you'll likely need at least 5 of the homeowners to agree to
dissolve the HOA. Laws may be different in your city, or your governing
documents may call for something more than the law requires as a
minimum; check your Governing Documents to determine what would be
needed for dissolution. You then need to determine what to do with any
community property which was owned by the HOA. You can sell it to a
private owner, or you can donate it to a charity. In either case, you
need the services of a real estate attorney who specializes in HOAs to
assist you with the transition. You (homeowners) will need to pay for
that attorney yourselves, and he ain't cheap. You'll also need to
re-file with the City to show that an HOA is no longer in place, and
that's not free either.
