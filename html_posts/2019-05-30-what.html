**What\'s the maximum period of time a person can be sentenced for
contempt of court for refusing to comply with a judge\'s request (like
answering a question)? Also, could a person be sent to a maximum
security prison for contempt?**

In the United States, civil contempt charges are not subject to the
principle of proportionality. In theory. a person can be held in
contempt indefinitely. A circuit court decision in 2002 (*Chadwick v.
Janecka)* stated this. The defendant in that case, H. Beatty Chadwick,
was held in contempt for 14 years, the longest contempt confinement in
history.

It's unlikely that someone would be sent to maximum security over a
contempt charge, but it's up to the state (or the Marshal's service for
federal contempt charges) to decide where prisoners are housed.
