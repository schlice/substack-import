There is no central repository for that information. In some cases,
states set those requirements for their law enforcement agencies, and in
others, there is no specific state guidance and it is left to the agency
to determine.

So to answer your question, your best bet is to make the request to the
law enforcement agency in question. You may be able to make a Freedom of
Information Act request for their explosives handling protocols. The
department may be able to avoid your request under one of the exemptions
to FOIA, namely Exemption 2: Information related solely to the internal
personnel rules and practices of an agency.

But you can at least try.
