This is never the right question to ask.

The right question to ask is: why should \<x\> be *illegal?*

If there is a compelling state interest for something to be illegal,
then a law should be created. But if there is not, then there should not
be.

We don't *ask permission* from government to live our lives.

And if someone is fortunate enough to have enough money to buy a whole
company, why can't he?
