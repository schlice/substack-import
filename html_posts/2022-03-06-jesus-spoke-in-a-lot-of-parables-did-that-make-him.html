Jesus was a teacher. Trying to teach difficult concepts, or concepts
which went against the accepted cultural norms, would have been
difficult if he had just spoken the concepts. It was much easier to
explain difficult concepts using parables. But they weren't just
parables. They were stories about situations that would have been
*deeply personal* to the people to whom he was speaking, which drove the
message home even more.

For example, look at the story of the Good Samaritan. Samaritans, to the
Jews he was addressing, were veritable *pariahs*. The Jews hated the
Samaritans, so much so that the Jews destroyed the Samaritans\' temple
on [[Mount
Gerizim](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=823ae0&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Gerizim){.external_link

reciprocally hated the Jews as well. When he told the story of the
person who was mugged, beaten, and left by the side of the road to die,
a Jewish priest and a Levite both walked past the man. But the Samaritan
was the only one to show kindness.

Jesus specifically picking a Samaritan man was intentional, based on his
target audience. The point Jesus was trying to get across was that an
individual of a social group his listeners disapprove of can exhibit
moral behavior that is superior to individuals of the groups they
approve. There really isn't a better example of ignoring prejudice as
when you challenge a listener's own belief system.

Another example would be the parable of the Prodigal Son. We all know
the story: the prodigal son wastes his inheritance and then comes
crawling home and the father throws a banquet for him, because the son
was lost, but now he's found. However, the simple fact that the children
asked the father for their inheritance *before he died* would have been
highly insulting and an incredible affront during that time. The idea
that these children would even be welcome *at all* would have been seen
as highly offensive. In the culture of the time, no one would ever think
to ask for their inheritance before the father died. So not only did the
father act mercifully, he did so *when he was so totally insulted by the
children in the first place*. The story takes on a whole new meaning
when you understand that their initial act was so culturally unheard of
in the first place.

You can see that the parable is an excellent vehicle to tell a story
about a complex topic, and it really hit home with the people Jesus was
teaching.

Original question:

Jesus spoke in a lot of parables. Did that make him seem like a
sarcastic jerk/smart-ass, or was he actually trying to help a person to
think deeper (looking at different perspectives)?
