**Does the Fourth Amendment apply to technology**

Absolutely.

**\[W\]ould the government be able to track us without the Fourth
Amendment?**

Much more easily than they can now. Without the 4th Amendment, they
could surreptitiously attach a GPS tracker to your car and find out
everywhere you went and how long you were there. They could potentially
hack your phone and install spyware to listen in on your calls or
monitor your social media, just waiting for you to break a law.

The 4th Amendment flips that entire narrative on its head:

> *The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,
> papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall
> not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause,
> supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the
> place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.*

Now, the police have to have probable cause that a crime has been, or
will be, committed, and **then** they can get a warrant to do a specific
search, which may involve technology.
