I thought you commit suicide when you unalive yourself. Last time I
checked, Jesus was killed by the religious leaders in Jerusalem. He
didn't kill Himself.

So by definition, it's not suicide.

He ***sacrificed*** Himself. And again, last time I checked, that was a
*noble* thing to do, not a sin. At worst, He'd be a **martyr**.

AND, He came back to life three days later. So did He *really* sacrifice
Himself if He came back from the dead? Does it count when you didn't
stay dead?

And eating an apple isn't a sin. By the way, the Bible never says it's
an apple, so it's clear you've never read the book. Probably too hard
for you, I get it. It's some heady stuff. I'd suggest you try reading
***The Message***, which is a Bible translation designed to read like a
novel instead of...you know...the Bible.

off topic...

Eating an apple isn't a sin. ***Disobeying God is a sin.*** And yeah,
it's a pretty big one. God literally tells you to not do something and
you do it anyway. Like God doesn't directly tell you or I things to do
or not do, but in this case, God told Adam to not eat the fruit, and he
did it anyway. I think that's a pretty big sin, wouldn't you say?
