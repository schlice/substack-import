**Is it true that we humans are only to eat vegetables?**

Let's look at human physiology, and let's see if it is appropriate to
categorize humans as herbivores:

- Human digestive tracts are shorter than herbivores, but longer than
  carnivores. Granted, it's closer to herbivores than carnivores, but
  it's not exactly either. We do not possess multiple stomachs or chew
  cud like herbivores.
- Humans cannot produce vitamin C on their own; they can only derive it
  from plant sources. Carnivores and some omnivores produce their own
  vitamin C.
- Humans produce hydrochloric acid, which is totally unnecessary for
  herbivores. It allows humans to digest a wide variety of plant and
  animal food sources.
- Humans cannot digest fiber like herbivores.

It is clear that we are neither designed to be herbivores nor are we
designed to be carnivores. Physiologically, we are more likely mixed
eaters (omnivores). Vegetarianism is a lifestyle choice enabled by a
first world food chain, not required by physiology.
