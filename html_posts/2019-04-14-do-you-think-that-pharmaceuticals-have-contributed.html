**Do you think that pharmaceuticals have contributed to school shootings
or mass shootings in the US?**

Only in a roundabout way.

Pharmaceuticals were one of the major drivers of
*deinstitutionalization*, or a de-emphasis on institutionalizing those
with mental issues, in favor of community clinics which could dispense
drugs to those who needed them.

Deinstitutionalization led to a whole host of issues, but primary is a
de-emphasis of mental illness in the United States, and the relegation
of treatment for even the most severely ill to community providers.

The remaining doctors who can prescribe drugs do not do any counseling,
and the counselors who help the mentally ill process their feelings and
emotions can't prescribe medications to help them do that. And ne'er the
twain shall meet, except in unusual circumstances (I know some doctors
who work very well with some counselors, and when the counselor
recommends a drug, the doctor writes the prescription, acting as the
"prescribing psychiatrist"). Otherwise, this schism prevents the
mentally ill from getting the treatment they so desperately need: a
combination of pharmaceuticals and therapy, which isn't provided in a
single location. There was a push during the Kennedy administration to
give some of those counseling providers "prescriptive authority," but
for any of them who are still alive, they're either retiring or no
longer practicing.

At any rate, this systemic de-emphasis on mental illness has made it
next to impossible to actually identify and treat the truly mentally
ill. Especially in our most vulnerable population: youth.

So while pharmaceuticals didn't cause the problem, it was the
over-reliance on pharmaceuticals, to the exclusion of inpatient care,
which shifted the overall focus of practice of mental illness, and the
subsequent de-emphasis on mental illness in America, relegating it to
the practice of supplementation and holistic medicine. Basically, any
treatment of anyone except for the truly schizoid insane is seen as
pseudoscience.

This entire system needs to be re-worked from the ground up.

Yes, there were problems with the mental institution system in the
United States, but dismantling it wholesale was not the answer. It was
that decision which has led to the inevitable buildup of those with
*treatable* mental conditions going untreated.

And solving their perceived problems with a gun.
