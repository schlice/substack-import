**Can multiple sclerosis affect one's personality for the worse?**

Short answer: yes.

Longer answer: You've read in these answers that living with a chronic
disease can induce depression, and injectable medications are also known
to cause depression.

However, you're asking about the disease actually changing your
personality. To that, I say it can, although it's less likely.

Think about it: your personality is partly made up of your life
experiences, which help to build you as a person. The things you've done
in life shape your very personality. If MS has wiped out any portion of
your memory, wouldn't that necessarily change who you are? In some
cases, it does.

That said, MS lesions do not frequently impact long term memory. They
most frequently impact the ability of short term memory to function
well. However, since everyone's MS is different, and in some cases, MS
can impact long term memory, if that happens, it can actually alter your
personality.

Whether it's for the "better" or for the "worse" is a matter of opinion.
But it can alter personality.
