**As a Trump supporter, can you either denounce your support for Trump
or admit that his supporters are actually domestic terrorists and
unpatriotic Americans after the insurgent attack on our US Capitol?**

No, I will do none of those things.

What I will do is state that ***whoever those individuals were*** *who
violently stormed the Capitol were criminals.* Whether or not they were
actually Trump supporters is still undecided, and I'll reserve my
judgement until I see the police reports myself.

I will also say that Trump's speech yesterday morning, at the very
least, was poorly executed. At the very worst, it amounted to conduct
unbecoming a president. Whether or not it was impeachable is a
discussion best left to Congress to decide. But it was best described as
the whiny, petulant ramblings of a spoiled child who didn't get his way.
Trump definitely deserves to be censured for that speech, and if
Congress feels so inclined, impeached.

None of this is indicative of Trump supporters *in general*. The only
judgement we can cast is on the small number of violent rioters who were
present at the Capitol building.

Casting that judgement across all Trump supporters is lazy thinking. No
one in their right minds would condone the actions of those violent
rioters.

But don't you find it *just the least bit ironic* that if this incident
had taken place just a few months ago, we would have been calling them
"mostly peaceful protesters?"

But because they happened to be wrapped in Trump flags and wearing MAGA
hats, they are suddenly "domestic terrorists" and "unpatriotic
Americans?"

Please don't bother trying to explain away the differences between what
happened yesterday and the violence that the media spent months
proclaiming was "mostly peaceful protesting." I don't look at the
"mostly peaceful protesters" and paint all Democrats like that. Don't do
the same with me.

I'm not going to condone the actions of a few (including the president),
nor will I paint the entire group with that broad brush.

Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a

shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion

If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\"
don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything
vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be followed by a
block/mute, and a BNBR report. I will do this immediately and with no
compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*
