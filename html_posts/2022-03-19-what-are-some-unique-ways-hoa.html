HOAs in the United States are 501(c)(4) non profit corporations. This
means that none of the money they collect is disbursed as *profit* to
anyone or any entity. All of the money they bring in goes back into
things the HOA must pay for (like insurance, electricity, water, etc),
and in to capital improvement projects for common use.

If an HOA needs money for a community project, they can either increase
dues, or implement a special assessment (if their governing documents
allow them to do so).
