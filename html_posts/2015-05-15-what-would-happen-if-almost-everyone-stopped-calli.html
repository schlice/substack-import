**Content:** [Cops would get really bored.\
\
Since there were no more calls for service, cops could focus more on
traffic infractions (yeah, that sounds like the outcome you were after),
and beneficially, community-oriented policing. We could definitely
reduce the number of patrols on the streets, reducing the number of paid
officers on the staff.\
\
Insurance claims would be very difficult to adjudicate. Without police
reports, insurance companies won\'t know the \"documented\" facts about
what happened, and insurance would become far more expensive to have and
to use, since insurance companies would have to do their own
investigations to determine what happened, and the results will always
be in their own best interests, not yours.\
\
And probably the biggest issue if people simply stop calling the police:
crime would dramatically increase because there\'s no chance of me being
caught and punished for my crime. As long as I can get away from you,
I\'m off scot-free. With no threat of police investigations following
me, no threat of crime scene analysis, no ballistics testing, etc., all
I have to do is kill you (and any other witnesses) and I\'m good to go.\
\
You would also see an increase in street justice. Didn\'t like the rough
ride Freddie Gray may have had? Maybe you shouldn\'t stop calling the
police, because that will become the way we deal with criminals. When
there are no jails to which we can send bad guys, we deal with them the
old-fashioned way: a lead pipe and a rough ride.\
\
Ultimately, organized crime would flourish, as gangs of organized
criminals would take over the policing of neighborhoods, charging
\"protection fees\" to all of the residents, who would either pay or be
subject to the same treatment as the criminals. You wouldn\'t have the
option to \*not\* call your local protectorate, as they would be there
patrolling your streets whether you liked it or not.\
\
The police would be back, but they wouldn\'t be government
organizations, they would be organized crime. You\'d have no choice but
to do what they said, when they said it, and they would be too powerful
for anyone to stop.\
\
Now, if the police were still around, and they decided to try to stop
this, you\'d have all-out war on your hands.]{.rendered_qtext}
