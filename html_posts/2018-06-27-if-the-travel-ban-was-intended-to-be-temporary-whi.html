**If the travel ban was intended to be temporary while the
administration worked out better procedures, why haven\'t they already
identified those procedures a year and a half later?**

The problem is not with US procedures. The problem is with the countries
with whom the ban has taken place.

The way visas work:

1.  Someone wants to visit America on a visa.
2.  Their consulate sends a visa request to the US.
3.  The US asks for certain information about the person wishing to
    travel.
4.  The home country sends that information to the US.
5.  The US reviews that information, and provides a yes/no on the visa
    application.

The problem with these countries: **their process breaks at step 4.**
They either never send information about the applicant, or they don't
send the information asked (usually basic criminal history information).

Additionally, not all countries treat all crimes the same, so things we
consider crimes are not necessarily treated as crimes in other
countries. So again, step 4 tends to be a problem if the home country
looks the other way on retribution murders, for example. Not saying any
of the target countries do, just an example off the top of my head.

When the host country is uncooperative, and when the host country does
not provide the information we need to make appropriate decisions about
visa applicants, we can't process those visas correctly. And if we can't
properly determine the intent of the visitor and whether or not it's
hostile to the US, the situation becomes potentially unsafe for us.

This is why we stopped travel from those countries.

That they are mostly majority Muslim nations is a red herring.
