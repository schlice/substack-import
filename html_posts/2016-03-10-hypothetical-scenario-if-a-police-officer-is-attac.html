*Legally,* there are no circumstances in which you have the legal
authority to resist a police officer in the performance of his duties.
In fact, doing so gives the officer *more* authority, not *less*, to
continue his assault.

However, since we\'re talking about a very unlikely hypothetical, I
think the assault would reach a point where you would have no choice but
to defend yourself.

The difference comes in the punishments. If the officer was legally
carrying out his authority but just used excessive force, he might lose
his job. If you defend yourself against a police officer, you are
resisting arrest, and quite possibly assaulting a peace officer, and
you\'re going to jail *and* you\'re a convicted felon.
