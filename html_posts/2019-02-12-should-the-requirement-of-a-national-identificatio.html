**Should the requirement of a national identification card be viewed
more as a violation of privacy or states rights or neither?**

It's not a violation of privacy. The Federal government can create an
identification card to identify you as an American citizen.

It's also not a violation of states' rights. The Federal government is
not forcing the states to use the ID card for anything.

Which raises the question: **why have a national ID card at all?**

What purpose would it serve? It wouldn't be used for elections, since
those are run by the states, and ID requirements vary. It wouldn't be
used for international identification; we have passports for that. And
we already have a passport card, which works like a passport book in and
around most places in North America you might reach by car or passenger
ship.

So what would be the purpose?

Unless you can come up with a good reason to have a national ID card,
then it just seems like a big waste of time and money.
