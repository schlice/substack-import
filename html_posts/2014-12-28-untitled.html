**Content:** [He makes a pretty important point in his analysis that
correlates with what you mentioned:\
\
\"The first point I want to draw your attention to is that roughly half
of shooting rampages end in suicide anyway. What that means is that
police are not ever in a position to stop most of them. Only the
civilians present at the time of the shooting have any opportunity to
stop those shooters. That's probably more important than the statistic
itself. In a shooting rampage, counting on the police to intervene at
all is a coin flip at best.\"]{.rendered_qtext}
