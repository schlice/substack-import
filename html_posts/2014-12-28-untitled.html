<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [He makes a pretty important point in his analysis that<br>correlates with what you mentioned:\<br>\<br>\"The first point I want to draw your attention to is that roughly half<br>of shooting rampages end in suicide anyway. What that means is that<br>police are not ever in a position to stop most of them. Only the<br>civilians present at the time of the shooting have any opportunity to<br>stop those shooters. That's probably more important than the statistic<br>itself. In a shooting rampage, counting on the police to intervene at<br>all is a coin flip at best.\"]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Why-are-there-so-many-mass-shootings-in-the-U-S/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
