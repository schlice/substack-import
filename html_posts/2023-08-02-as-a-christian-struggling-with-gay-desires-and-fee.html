Oh good Lord no. He is probably more sad about it than you are.

You do not have these desires and feelings because of some failing of
your own. You have them because of *sin*. Not something you *did*, but
something you *are*.

See, we are all sinners by nature. We are born into these sinful bodies,
in a fallen world. Our sin nature subjects our physical bodies to all
sorts of problems, including but not limited to: health problems (both
mental and physical), pain, suffering and eventual death.

Your homosexual desires and feelings are a direct result of that sin
nature which has corrupted our physical bodies. Paul addressed exactly
this problem in the early church in Corinth. There were people then
(over 2000 years ago) struggling with exactly the same thing. So it's
important to understand that not only are you not alone, but you're not
the first to ever have to deal with this.

Paul wrote the following to them:

> Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of
> God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters
> nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men nor thieves nor the
> greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the
> kingdom of God. --- 1 Corinthians 6:9--10 NIV

So this is where most people get the information that the Bible
prohibits homosexual acts. But in case you glossed over it,
**homosexuality is not the only sin addressed here.** Paul also
addresses the sexually immoral, idolaters, adulterers, thieves, those
who are greedy, drunkards, slanderers and swindlers. That's not to
compare you to them, but it is to show that your particular sin is not
being picked on here. ALL of these sins---if you love them, embrace
them, pursue them, live in them---will ultimately destroy you. Not just
homosexuality.

But Paul goes on and gives some information that is *absolutely crucial*
in the struggle against sin:

> And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were
> sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
> and by the Spirit of our God. --- 1 Corinthians 6:11 NIV

These words are *massively* important to someone who struggles with
same-sex attraction and hopes to be pure and holy in their life. The
first sentence there says "And that is what some of you **were**." You
**were** that. You may have practiced homosexuality in the past. You are
**no longer** that. Why? What happened? How **were** you that, and now
are **no longer** that? The answer is in the next sentence: you were
*washed*, you were *sanctified*, you were *justified*. You were *washed*
in the blood of Christ when you accepted Him as your Savior and you put
your faith in Him. You were *sanctified* when that happened; you were
declared righteous. And you were *justified* in those things. How? In
the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and **by the Spirit of our God.**

There it is. It is the power of the Holy Spirit that is the key to
overcoming this daily struggle.

Have you ever heard the phrase, "God doesn't give you more than you can
handle"? Well, that's untrue. God always gives you more than you can
handle, because He wants you to lean on Him for strength in overcoming
those challenges. Paul talks about it later in the same letter to the
people of Corinth:

> No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. And
> God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can
> bear.

This first part of the verse is where people get the idea that "God
won't give you what you can't handle." But they miss the second part,
which must be examined in context:

> But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you
> can endure it. --- 1 Corinthians 10:13 NIV

God does give you what you cannot handle, because He gives you **a way
out** so that you can **endure** it. And what is it that He gives you?
Paul mentioned it in Chapter 6 verse 11: *the spirit of our God*. The
Holy Spirit.

The takeaway here is that **God gives you the Holy Spirit to help you
through your struggles.** What this means on a day to day basis is that
first, you must know that when you put your true faith in Christ as your
savior, you are accepted, forgiven, washed clean, declared righteous,
sanctified, and justified. Then, you trust that God gives you the Holy
Spirit to come in power and help you resist temptation. You "put to
death" the desires of the flesh (cf Romans 8:13) and you rely on the
Spirit. You call upon the Spirit. You live in the Spirit.

It is not by your efforts, but by His grace. He graciously gives you the
Spirit to help you with your struggles.

When you hear the promise, you believe in it, you rely on it, you live
in it, and you put your faith and trust in it, you can be sure that God
will send the Spirit to help you. When He does, it makes the promise of
His reward more precious to you than the power of the temptation you are
facing, and then you are able to overcome it.

It's the easiest thing to do, and yet it's the hardest thing to do. It's
a free gift that will cost you your life. You have turned your life over
to Christ. Now rely on that faith and God's promise to send His Spirit
to help you live a pure and useful life without sexual sin.
