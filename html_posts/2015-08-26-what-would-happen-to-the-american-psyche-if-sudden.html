**Content:** [I know that your question involves modifying the Second
Amendment, and as you have already heard from others, you can\'t just
\"modify\" an Amendment without another Amendment that either modifies
or repeals it.\
\
But what if you could pass a law that made it harder to buy guns? Your
argument is that you still have the right to bear arms, but you just
can\'t buy them. If you can get them, however, you can \"bear\" them.
This, however, violates the spirit and the letter of the Second
Amendment, because any law that prevents you from buying, owning, or
using guns is illegal. Clearly, we have placed some sensible
restrictions on purchasing and owning guns (convicted felons and the
mentally ill cannot own them, along with the myriad of other laws at a
state level), but laws that prevent you from owning (which includes the
purchase of) guns are unconstitutional.\
\
(EDIT) I\'d like to address the additional comment of the OP, who added
*\"The OP would like to think we still value a human life over the right
to own and play with your guns.\"*\
\
The OP clearly believes that his right to be free from gun violence
trumps my right to defend myself ***against*** gun violence. There is
nothing at all that prevents a criminal from acquiring a gun illegally,
and using it against me illegally. So if I have to follow the law and
the criminal, by very definition, does not, the only people affected if
you \"remove guns\" are the likes of me \-- honest, law-abiding citizens
who, if you met me on the street, you\'d never know that I was carrying
a gun. Heck, you\'ve probably met me before, a thousand times, and you
had no idea that I had a gun secreted on my person. That\'s the point.
Unless there is some need for you to see my gun, you\'ll probably never,
ever see it. *My* guns are used only for defense, never for offense. And
under the Constitution, I retain the right to defend myself against all
forms of tyranny and evil with my guns.\
\
Really, it\'s not about you. Don\'t make my rights about you. My rights
are about me.]{.rendered_qtext}
