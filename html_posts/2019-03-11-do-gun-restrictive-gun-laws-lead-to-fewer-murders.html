**Do gun restrictive gun laws lead to fewer murders?**

The article uses spurious logic and statistics without appropriate
basis.

The statistics showing city and state crime rates are not normalized.
Therefore, they don't account for population size or population density.

They also quote a number of 33,000 gun deaths every year, conveniently
forgetting to mention that 22,000 of those gun deaths are suicides, and
8,000 of the remaining 11,000 are gang and drug related.

Finally, while they talk about gun crime, they don't say anything at all
about **crime in general**, and how reducing the number of guns in the
hands of law-abiding citizens affects crime overall.

It's nothing more than a story intended to scare the uninformed.
