I guess it's up to me to buck the apparent trend.

**No, a human cannot give birth to something that is not** ***human.***

The answer to this question clearly rests on what you define as "human."
So: *what is a human?*

A human is an organism which is given rise by two human parents, one
male, and one female. Embryologically, when the male sperm joins with
the female egg and produce a zygote, this organism is the earliest form
of human being. Some other forms this early human progresses through are
called a blastocyte, an embryo, and a fetus. **But crucially**, at every
phase, in every form, the organism is undeniably ***human***.

When two humans mate and produce a zygote, that organism is human. It
can never be anything else beyond a human. Even if it comes out with
developmental defects and doesn't *look* human. Even if it doesn't look
human while it is still developing. It meets all of the criteria for
being human. It cannot *not* be a human, as it has two human parents.
Two human parents can only produce a human offspring and nothing else.

It also rests on what you define as "giving birth." In this context, we
are discussing the natural process by which a gestating fetus is
delivered through the birth canal at approximately 40 weeks of
pregnancy. Some parasites (which do not belong in the host and for which
the host does not have specialized structures to grow and nurture) can
emerge from their hosts, but this process is generally not referred to
as "giving birth."
