**No they did not.** When asking questions, it helps to know what
precisely happened.

From the actual decision:

> defy her belief that marriage should be reserved to unions between one
> man and one woman.

The decision **DID NOT** say that business owners can discriminate
against gay couples. In fact, if a gay couple was denied service, they
could absolutely bring a complaint under state law and the business
would face disciplinary action.

Lorie Smith, just like Jack Phillips, does business with ***everyone***.
Gay, straight, black, white, whatever.

What they will *not* do is express messages which conflict with their
deeply-held religious beliefs.

And the Court said that the First Amendment protects the right of a
business to not speak a state-endorsed message which does not comport
with their beliefs.

It's not about the *people*. It's about the *message*.

Absolutely! In fact, if they are at all concerned about it, we
**encourage** gay couples (and those who support them) to choose the
businesses with which they work carefully, making sure they only choose
to endorse the businesses whose ideals are in line with their own.

This "choosing" of businesses is called **free-market capitalism**. A
business exchange is a mutually agreed-upon transaction between a
willing buyer and a willing seller. Both the buyer and the seller must
be willing and able to engage in the transaction. Then, and only then,
will the transaction proceed.

No one should compel either the buyer or the seller to engage in the
transaction against their will. Free-market capitalism ideally would
never compel either the buyer or the seller to engage in commerce.
