The key is "the same exact situation."

It is ***very likely*** that anyone, regardless of skin color, in "the
same exact situation" as Castile, would be shot and killed by police.

That situation: one in which the police give you conflicting orders, and
in your attempt to obey one, you violate the other.

Castile was told to reach for his license, but not reach for his gun,
both of which were ostensibly somewhere near each other. There was no
way he could reach for his license without it appearing that he was
reaching for his gun.

Anyone forced into such a situation could very likely be shot and killed
by the police.

The police should be held accountable for their error which placed
Castile in that position in the first place. To date, they have not.
This is what I would call a "miscarriage of justice."
