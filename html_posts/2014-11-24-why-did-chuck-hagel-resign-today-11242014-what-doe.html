**Content:** [Hagel and the current White House administration did not
see eye to eye on a lot of issues, considering Hagel is a Republican.\
\
Additionally, the administration, being Democratic, must be associated
with \"drawdown\" and elimination of war. Instead, we\'re ramping up
against ISIS. This again causes the administration to look bad in its
own party (regardless of whether or not we need to be ramping up), and
calls for Hagel\'s ouster have been increasing over the past few
months.]{.rendered_qtext}
