The president is indeed correct in saying that calling it by a specific
moniker doesn't change our stance towards extremism.

*But he's missing the point*.

Rather than me bumbling my way through it, let me leave the answer to
the great Maha Rushie, El Rushbo, [[Rush
Limbaugh](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6df1fe&url=http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2016/06/14/barack_obama_attorney_for_the_defense){.external_link

I can answer Rush's question right there. He knows *exactly* what he's
talking about. He is **defending** the "Religion of Peace" because he
believes that by defending Islam, he somehow makes America seem more
"inclusive." He does this because he truly believes that *terrorists
will stop being bad if America stops being bad first*. If they have no
reason to hate us, they will stop being terrorists, right?

Except for that fact that "they hate us because they ain't us." Which
means they will never stop hating us. It also means that nothing he can
do will stop them from hating us.

This is why labels matter. It helps you to focus on what is really at
issue. Americans deplore his lack of labeling because they don't know
that he really knows what he is fighting.

Until he can wrap his brain around the fact that he is truly battling
"radical Islam," no one will have full confidence that he has determined
the objective of the war.
