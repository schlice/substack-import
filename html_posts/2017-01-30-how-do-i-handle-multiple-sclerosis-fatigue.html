Great question!

First, please discuss with your doctor, if you haven't done so yet.
Sometimes, fatigue isn't just MS lassitude. There are medical issues
which can cause fatigue, either related to, or unrelated to MS, such as
depression, thyroid disease, and anemia. Your doctor should check for
these conditions.

Fatigue can also be a side effect of some medications; your neurologist
should review everything you're taking.

Finally, the [[MS
Society](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4c2dce&url=http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Symptoms-Diagnosis/MS-Symptoms/Fatigue){.external_link

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container} recommends the
following interventions for fatigue:

> - Occupational therapy to simplify tasks at work and home.
> - Physical therapy to learn energy-saving ways of walking (with or
>   without assistive devices) and performing other daily tasks, and to
>   develop a regular exercise program (which you already have done, so
>   focus more on PT to learn more energy-saving ways to do everyday
>   tasks)
> - Sleep regulation, which might involve treating other MS symptoms
>   that interfere with sleep (e.g., spasticity, urinary problems) and
>   using sleep medications on a short-term basis.
> - Psychological interventions, such as stress management, relaxation
>   training, membership in a support group, or psychotherapy.
> - Heat management --- strategies to avoid overheating and to cool
>   down.
> - Medications --- [[amantadine hydrochloride

I have to agree with [[Michele
Camera](https://www.quora.com/profile/Michele-Camera)]{.qlink_container}
and the Monster suggestion. I have been able to power through fatigue
when I need it with that stuff.

I also swear by heat management. I've noticed that if I've ever
overheated myself due to over-exertion, I'm totally spent. It's vicious
when it happens. I've literally fallen asleep in my clothes when I've
done it.
