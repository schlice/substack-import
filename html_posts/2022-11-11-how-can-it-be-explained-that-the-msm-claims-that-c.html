*(Despite what the "world" thinks it knows, this answer is specific to
the US only)*

**Because "crime" is a pretty big bucket, and it contains more than just
murder.** And the reason that these numbers are changing is because of
*the effects of the events surrounding COVID-19.*

In 2020, the murder rate (the number of murders per 100,000 people) rose
sharply, by almost 30%. Assaults were up as well, by almost 10%. And the
increases were even across both red and blue states. The number of
murders was also up:

However, other types of crime were *down*. Property crimes reached a
record *low* in 2020. There could be many reasons for this, but
lockdowns and people losing their jobs (thus spending more time at home)
could be a contributing factor.

None of this changes the fact that *overall crime has been declining for
the past decade.*

**TL;DR:** ¿Por qué no los dos? Overall crime is indeed down over the
last decade, while murders are up almost 30% in 2020.
