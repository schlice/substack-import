TL;DR: I wouldn't go so far as to say you have a "right" to know exactly
what the police are doing exactly when you believe you should know. The
information is releasable; the timeframe in which a department releases
the information is up to them.

You can find out what calls the police were responding to at any given
time. Most departments make public the "police blotter" which is a
record of all of the calls which officers were dispatched to handle. One
of our local departments' PIO (Public Information Office) posts blotter
entries to their public Twitter feed (ah, technology...), usually within
an hour or so of their entry. "Newsworthy" entries (i.e. shooting
downtown) or entries which should be disseminated in the interest of
public safety (i.e. crash on Main Street, please try to avoid the area)
are released very quickly. Another local agency has an interactive
online blotter which allows you to input a timeframe and it will show
all blotter entries during that period.

Not all departments do this, nor are they under any legal obligation to
do so.

For departments which do not publicly post their blotter entries, you
can always call the dispatcher and ask. You might get an answer. Then
again, you might get a generic "we can't disclose information about
active incidents" response. In such a case, after the conclusion of the
incident, you can file a FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) request since
the police department is a government agency. You can request
information about calls which were answered in your neighborhood during
the timeframe in question. So long as there is not an open active
investigation, the department will provide you with that information.

The upshot of all of this is that the information is available. The
timeframe in which you can receive this information is different for
each organization.
