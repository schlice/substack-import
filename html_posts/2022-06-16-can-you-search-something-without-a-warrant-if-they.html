*(US answer)*

Yes, a car. A police officer can search a car with probable cause and no
warrant. The automobile exception allows cars to be searched with
probable cause only because there is a lower expectation of privacy in a
car, given the regulatory environment in which it operates.
Additionally, because it is mobile, evidence can quickly be moved and
destroyed, so time is of the essence.

In nearly every other circumstance, the probable cause must be used as
the basis to obtain a search warrant. These days, that can be done
fairly quickly with handheld electronic devices.

There are other times when police do not need a warrant to search:

- Plain sight. If illegal items (drugs, etc) are in plain sight (and the
  "plain smell" test has been extended to this exception as well), they
  can be seized and used as evidence, and the surrounding area can also
  be searched.
- Search incident to an arrest. If you are being arrested, the police
  can search you and your vicinity (your home or car). They can also
  perform a "protective sweep" if they believe you may have accomplices
  in the area, and they can seize any evidence they find in plain sight.
- Consent. If they ask, and you agree, the police can search without a
  warrant. In this case, they don't even need probable cause. They also
  are not required to tell you that you have the right to refuse
  consent.
- Exigent circumstances. If the police feel that the amount of time
  needed to get a warrant is too long to prevent the loss or destruction
  of evidence, or if someone's life is in peril (or would otherwise
  jeopardize public safety), or if a suspect may escape, the police can
  proceed without a warrant. Preserving evidence, apprehending suspects,
  and saving lives take precedence over obtaining warrants.
