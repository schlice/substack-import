**Do dash cams act as CCTV for cars, so if someone vandalises it in a
parking lot, for example, will it record the crime?**

They can, but in their default mode of operation, they usually do not.

In order for your dash cam to do this, it has to have a few features,
and you have to install a feature.

1.  Your dash cam has to be able of recording in what's called "parking
    mode" or "parking surveillance mode." This means that when the car
    is off, the camera can continue to operate. This requires sufficient
    battery to maintain a motion sensor and activate when it senses
    motion. Most dash cams, by default, are not programmed to use this
    feature even if they have it.
2.  In general, in order to use a parking mode feature, you need to
    provide continuous power to the camera, even when the car is off.
    Simply cutting off the 12v power socket and hard-wiring the camera
    to an always-on power source is not adviseable, because if your car
    sits too long, you can drain the battery and then your car won't
    start. To accomplish this, you need a smart power controller. The
    controller is wired to both an always-on power source, and a
    switched power source (one which turns on and off with the car). The
    smart power controller draws power from the always-on feed, but uses
    the switched power source as a sense cable. When it senses the car
    has been turned off, it tells the camera to switch to parking mode.
    It also monitors the amount of amperage coming from the battery, and
    when it drops too low (i.e. the car battery is running out of
    juice), it turns off the camera so that you can still start your
    car, saving your battery. Also, the dash cam has to be able to
    understand the signals from the power controller such that it can
    switch from real-time recording mode to parking sensor mode.
3.  Finally, as others have mentioned, the vandalism must be of a
    sufficiently jarring nature as to trigger the camera to record. If
    someone is scratching your car or spray painting your car, it likely
    won't be enough motion to trigger the camera.
