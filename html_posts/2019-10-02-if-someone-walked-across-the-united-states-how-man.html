**If someone walked across the United States, how many steps would it
take?**

Simple math equation, if you plug a few variables first. The equation
would become more or less complicated depending on which variables you
add or remove.

The distance from New York to Los Angeles is [[2789.8 miles along
I-80](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=74b200&url=https://www.google.com/search?q%3Ddistance%2Bfrom%2Bnew%2Byork%2Bto%2Blos%2Bangeles%26oq%3Ddistance%2Bfrom%2B%26aqs%3Dchrome.0.69i59j69i57j0l4.1871j0j4%26sourceid%3Dchrome%26ie%3DUTF-8){.external_link

mile, is 14,730,144 feet.

Assuming the average male's stride length (stride meaning the distance
you travel in one step) is [[2.5
feet](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4c6cc3&url=https://livehealthy.chron.com/average-walking-stride-length-7494.html){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="chron.com"}]{.qlink_container}, it will take 5,892,058
steps. Assuming the average woman's stride length is [[2.2
feet](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4c6cc3&url=https://livehealthy.chron.com/average-walking-stride-length-7494.html){.external_link

steps.
