Time to take his entire quote into context. Because **text** without
**context** is just **pretext.**

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\...](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6d5327&url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DHRl0bdl3wXk){.external_link

What was his next statement after that one?

"You might say, 'Well, no, the planet has too many people on it,' it's
like 'yeah, whatever, good luck with that.' Every single one of your
ancestors reproduced in an unending procession lasting three and a half
billion years. And they're all wrong and you're right? I don't think
so."

The problem is that he's using the wrong words. And you're not taking a
strong enough interest in biology.

When you "want to have sex with someone" you actually, biologically,
want to create children. You may not want children, but you're doing the
one thing, the only thing, that creates children. So if you are having
sex because your body is telling you to have sex, it's not to have fun
or to grow love or any of those excuses. It's to make children. Your
biological drive which causes you to desire sex is to procreate, to
further the species. You may do it because it's enjoyable, but it's
enjoyable because you're supposed to do it to further the species. In
other words, your desire for sex is, at a root biological level, to make
children.

So somehow, all of your ancestors over the last three and a half billion
years were wrong, and you are right? You want to do the thing which
makes children but you don't want children? Yeah, I'll agree with
Peterson: **I don't think so.** You're either deluded (you don't realize
the consequences of having sex) or immature (you don't care that you
could get pregnant).

But if you break it down, he's right.
