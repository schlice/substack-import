**My breasts hurt so bad, but one breast hurts more than the other. One
has severe pain and is constant. Could it be breast cancer?**

*Could it be?* ***OF COURSE IT COULD BE!***

It could also be sunspots, although that's far less likely.

The point is that it *could be* anything. It could be a poor-fitting
bra. It could be the way you sleep. It could be something you're eating.
It could be breast cancer. Or it could be sunspots.

So before we jump to "my breasts hurt, I must have breast cancer," let's
talk quickly about the most common causes of breast pain.

Most commonly, the cause of breast pain is hormones. Specifically,
hormones in and around your menstrual cycle.

Breast pain is described as either **cyclic** or **noncyclic,**
depending on whether or not the pain can be correlated with the
menstrual cycle:

Mayo Clinic goes on to summarize breast pain like this:

> Most times, breast pain signals a noncancerous (benign) breast
> condition and **rarely indicates breast cancer.** Still, unexplained
> breast pain that doesn\'t go away after one or two menstrual cycles or
> that persists after menopause **needs to be evaluated by your
> doctor.**

Ultimately, **no one on the Internet can diagnose your breast pain
issues**. For that, you must see a doctor. Make an appointment with your
primary care doctor and explain this to him or her. Talk about whether
or not the pain is consistent or periodic, and whether or not the pain
is sharp, affects a single area, or is diffuse (i.e. the entire breast
hurts or just one small area).

**TL;DR:** So could it be breast cancer? Yes it could, but it's highly
unlikely. Breast pain that doesn't go away after one or two menstrual
cycles needs to be evaluated by your doctor.

Good luck!
