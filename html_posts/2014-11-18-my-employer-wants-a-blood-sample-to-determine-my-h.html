**Content:** [My doctor can take my blood because I know that HIPAA and
doctor-patient confidentiality means that he can\'t use it in any other
way other than to benefit my health. And he can\'t tell anyone about
what he finds; what I disclose is up to me, not my doctor.\
\
I don\'t trust my insurance company as far as I can throw them. If they
find a loophole in HIPAA, they will use it to benefit their bottom line.
I have no doubt of that. Obamacare actually makes it harder for
insurance companies to make money, so I can only see this getting worse,
not better. I can\'t see a release statement being so air-tight that
they can only use your blood to determine if you are a smoker and
nothing else.\
\
I\'d be wary of this, for sure.\
\
You are part of a \"risk pool\" where the risk of you contracting a
certain disease and causing an increase in what they pay out is spread
across an entire pool of people. Granted, they are doing everything they
can to minimize risk, but they can\'t deny you coverage. They can only
pass the costs on to you. And especially with the government now
increasing taxes on insurance companies instead of you, insurance
companies are going to do everything and anything to satisfy that bottom
line. They are going to be looking for things that they can use to
charge you more. Having your blood gives them a palette, a smorgasbord
of things they can use to charge you more.]{.rendered_qtext}
