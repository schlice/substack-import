I assume you mean \"outside the range,\" because every police officer
fires his or her gun on a regular basis in the gun range. They are
required to re-certify at an interval to be determined by the state in
question.

Outside the range, the vast majority of police officers go their entire
careers never firing their weapons outside the range. I will have to get
you statistics, but it is a very, very small number.
