I thought there was a minimum age to vote. Maybe I'm wrong about that.
I'll have to go look that one up. If the person isn't of voting age, it
really doesn't make sense to even send them a ballot, even if you know
they exist. I mean, why don't they send ballots to every registered
child in every household? Because they can't use them. There's literally
no justification for doing so.

Also, most states since the 2020 election have made it illegal to mail a
ballot to someone who has not requested a mail-in ballot. You know,
because of situations just like this. Of course, Democrats denounced
this, saying that Republican legislatures which were just trying to rein
in the excesses during the pandemic are actually "disenfranchising"
voters (they say that word a lot without really understanding what it
means).

We could very easily fix this if we simply require an ID to vote. I
think most fetuses don't have ID, so it's unlikely they'll be voting any
time soon. I think we don't need to worry about this one too much.

Original question:

Why can\'t Republicans understand that if SCOTUS overturns Roe v. Wade,
The DemonRATS will start mailing ballots to every embryo and fetus ever
conceived, even the aborted ones, and totally wipe out the \"Red Wave\"
they were expecting?
