**Can you be a Christian if you don\'t believe that Jesus was/is God?**

Of course you can be a Christian! We welcome everyone into the club!

The *real* question you should be asking, however, is:

*Can you be saved if you don't believe that Jesus was/is God?*

And that answer, my dear friends, is no.

As for evidence, I need only point you to the most important verse of
the New Testament: John 3:16

> *For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that
> whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.\
> - John 3:16*

Let's break this verse down:

**For God so loved the world**: God actually loves His creation

**that he gave his one and only Son**: despite your interpretation of
"Son," there are many passages in the Bible which explain that Jesus is
both fully human and fully divine, and that Jesus is one of the three
beings in the Trinity

**that whoever believes in him**: this is the one thing you have to do:
*believe that Jesus is God and that He died for your sins*

**shall not perish**: this indicates that some will perish;
specifically, those who don't believe in Him

**but have eternal life**: pretty self-explanatory, the opposite of
those who "shall perish."
