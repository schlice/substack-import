**Content:** [Assuming that you\'re in some sort of combat scenario.\
\
1. Grab it and throw it back.\
\
2. If you can\'t do that, grab your bucket (helmet), and dive on top of
it, placing your bucket on top of the grenade, and your body on top of
the bucket. Your feet and lower legs will probably get some shrapnel,
but better that than everyone else in your squad dying.\
