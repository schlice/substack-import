Despite your misgivings about what is "wrong" or not, the bottom line is
that we are a nation of laws. We are literally the only country in the
world whose government is entirely founded on a piece of paper. No
juntas, no oligarchs (despite the Leftists' claims), no religious
leaders, no kings. Just a piece of paper and elections. As a nation, we
live and die by those laws.

If you don't like the laws, as Paul mentioned, you elect leaders who
will change them. You lobby your elected leaders to get them to change
them. But our nation of laws also has a law that says that the laws are
applied to all people equally (see the 14th Amendment). So whether you
think it's "fair" or not, if we have a law, it applies equally to
everyone. It's not about being "fair," it's about being "just." Those
are two totally separate concepts.

Part of the problem you are citing is not necessarily a problem with the
legal system, it's a problem with Congress. Congress has abrogated much
of its responsibility under the Constitution by creating *bureaucracy*.
So while we may not be a monarchy or an oligarchy, we are creating
*bureaucratic despotism* in the United States. The EPA, for example, is
an organization filled with civil servants. Unelected, unaccountable (to
us) civil servants who create regulation which carries the force of law.
We can be punished for violating EPA regulations. That means those
regulations are just like laws passed by our Congresspeople. This is in
violation of the Constitution, which clearly states in Article I that
all laws are to be created by Congress, not by bureaucracy. But Congress
has allowed this to happen. Not only did they allow it to happen, but
they created the bureaucracy in the first place.
