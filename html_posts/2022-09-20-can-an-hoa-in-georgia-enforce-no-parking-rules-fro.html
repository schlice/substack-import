The short answer is yes.

The longer answer is "it depends on what you mean by **enforcement**."

When you join (or are involuntarily joined to) an HOA, you essentially
enter a "contract" under which you agree to follow the rules as they are
written by the HOA. One of those rules may be that owners and guests
cannot park on the streets overnight (as an example from a former HOA of
mine). Doesn't matter if the streets are public or private, if your
rules say that you cannot park your car on the streets overnight, then
you can't.

The question becomes what the HOA can do about this.

Because the HOA does not own the streets, they cannot have the car
towed. They cannot "boot" the car until fines are paid. However, they
**can** fine the owner. The HOA can indeed issue fines for parking on a
public street when the Governing Documents say that you can't park
there.

There is a lot of confusion on this point, including by lawyers. A lot
of that confusion stems from the fact that it's a public street and the
HOA has no authority to regulate parking on a public street. However,
the HOA has broad authority to regulate the look of the neighborhood,
and where and when vehicles are parked definitely impacts the look of
the neighborhood. As long as the restrictions are not onerous and as
long as they do not impede fair use of the property, and as long as the
HOA is not arbitrary or capricious in its enforcement of that rule,
courts have generally given the HOA latitude to make the neighborhood
look the way they want it to look. That said, it is universally accepted
that an HOA cannot boot/tow cars from public streets.

In my example above from a previous neighborhood where we disallowed
overnight parking, we also cited safety as a factor. During the winter
(which could see the streets snow-packed and dangerous to drive on), you
could have garbage trucks and school buses attempting to navigate the
streets simultaneously. When kids are out, you want them as safe as
possible. And trying to have all of those competing large vehicles
traversing the streets while weaving around parked cars is simply a
recipe for disaster. The HOA definitely had a vested interest in
safeguarding children in that case.

In a neighborhood where it is not against the law to park in a
particular area, you can still have a CC&R rule which forbids parking,
and the HOA can fine you for violating that rule. If you get a
particularly zealous lawyer, you *may* be able to fight that one and you
*may* win depending on how your local courts lean in terms of who is
favored (the homeowner vs the HOA). But you'll still have to fight it in
court.
