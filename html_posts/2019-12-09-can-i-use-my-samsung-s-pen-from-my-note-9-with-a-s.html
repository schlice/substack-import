**Can I use my Samsung S Pen from my Note 9 with a Samsung Galaxy Tab?**

No.

The S Pen is an *inductive stylus*, and it works with an active
digitizer which induces an electromagnetic field from underneath the
screen of a Samsung Note phone. When the S Pen moves close to that
active digitizer, the electromagnetic field in the digitizer induces a
current in the pen, and they begin communicating with each other, even
before the pen touches the display. That's part of the beauty of the
system, and how it can work so well.

Non-S Pen tablets and phones use a *capacitive touch display.* Your
finger (and a regular stylus) is an electrostatic conductor. The hard
outer glass on your phone is also an electrostatic conductor. When you
touch the glass (either with your finger or a normal stylus), the
electrostatic field changes, and your phone registers that change as a
touch, a tap, or a drag.

*(I have a Note 10+ and a Tab A, and I have tested this)*
