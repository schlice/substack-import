Federal law defines animals broadly, such as defining what an \"exotic\"
animal is, what a \"domesticated\" animal is, etc. It provides import
restrictions on certain exotic animals, but other than that, there is no
broad set of restrictions on any animal in the United States, it is left
to the states and to cities.

States and cities define what animals can be licensed in those
jurisdictions as household pets. This varies between jurisdictions, but
all states allow the most common household pets: dogs, cats, birds, and
small mammals (guinea pigs, hamsters, etc). Other less-common pets are
less well standardized between states.

Often, homeowner\'s associations (HOAs) define further what types and
quantities of domesticated animals may reside within their
jurisdictions. This sometimes poses conflicts when less-common pets
become more common or more acceptable as pets (for example, pot-bellied
pigs).
