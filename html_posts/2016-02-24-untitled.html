*They are demanding Apple build a backdoor into their product.*

I\'m sorry that I must take exception at this point, because what you
are saying is **patently false**.

I know you truly believe that the FBI wants complete and unfettered
access to everyone\'s smartphones all the time without a warrant, but
that\'s simply not the case.

If you read the court order, the FBI is not asking for a backdoor.

A \"backdoor\" means something built in to the operating system that
allows the FBI to decrypt the contents of the phone at will, without any
intervention by anyone, with their own special \"key.\"

***This could not be further from the truth, and it is disingenuous of
you to claim such.***

What the FBI wants to do to **THIS ONE PHONE** is the following:

1.  Remove the \"10 strikes and you\'re wiped\" feature.
2.  Remove the time delay between incorrect PIN entries
3.  Enable external keyboards for PIN entry

You also claim that \"the FBI will have the software and can use it on
any phone.\" This too is untrue. The order states that Apple can keep
the software at their headquarters. It never has to leave. In fact, all
the work to weaken the security posture of the phone will be done at
Apple\'s headquarters.

It will be the FBI that then breaks into the phone **not by defeating
the encryption**, but by using a \"brute-force attack\" against the
phone, repeatedly guessing passcodes at a rapid rate (using an external
keyboard and hacking software) until the phone is unlocked. The
encryption algorithms will never be touched.
