As a student of history, I can tell you that war criminals are only
found on the *losing* side.

So in order to "round up the Israeli war criminals," Israel has to
*lose*.

Do you seriously think that the Palestinian Authority can *win*? Even
the Palestinian Authority knows they can't beat Israel. They're hoping
to win a *propaganda war*, not a physical war. They need to provoke
*just enough Israeli* ***retaliation*** that their propaganda machine
can re-package and disseminate to gullible patsies like yourself as
"Israeli war crimes."

So ultimately, the only war criminals who will be rounded up will be
Arab, not Israeli.
