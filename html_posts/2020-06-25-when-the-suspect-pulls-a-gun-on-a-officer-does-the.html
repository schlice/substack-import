**When someone pulls a gun on a officer does the officer have to shoot
the suspect?**

The question has nothing to do with whether or not the victim of the
assault is a police officer.

**Every** American has the right to self-defense.

So the question is more appropriately written:

**When someone pulls a gun on an American citizen, does the American
citizen have to shoot the aggressor?**

So let's examine the situation.

You are faced with a life-and-death scenario. Someone has employed
lethal force against you. Your question: do you have to use lethal force
against them?

The answer: how badly do you want to live, and how assured do you want
to be that your actions will ensure your continued survival?

It sounds as though you are unconvinced that you are in an actual
life-and-death situation. You must be clear on this. This is one of
those "it's him or me" situations that you never hope to be a part of.

But if you are, you want to be assured that the method you employ will
bring you home alive.

The tool that provides you with the best possibility that you will make
it home alive is the firearm. No other tool provides you with the
immediate, pinpoint stopping power that a firearm does.

So to answer your question, in this scenario, when someone pulls a gun
on a officer does the officer have to shoot the suspect?

Given what we have discussed, **yes**. Not by law, or by department
policy, but *by right as an American citizen to self-defense.*
