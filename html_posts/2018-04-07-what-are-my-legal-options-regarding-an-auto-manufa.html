**What are my legal options regarding an auto manufacturer defending a
dishonest dealership which claimed to find no issues in their multiple
test drives of my lemon car lease?**

Contact a local attorney in your area for specifics.

But since you mentioned it, there is a "Lemon Law" that probably has a
corollary in your state. Your lawyer should be able to help you navigate
the intricacies of that law and what you need to do under it.
