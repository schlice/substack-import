**Content:** [It\'s a tricky gray area. Being homosexual is not a
protected class under Federal law, but it may be protected under state
law, so depending on the state the restaurant is in, they *may* be able
to deny service to the couple if their presence hurts his business.\
\
But because this would generate a lot of controversy, the act itself may
be more damaging to the business than their presence anyway.\
\
I think he should close his restaurant. Then people won\'t have to worry
about eating in the same building as gays. For the life of me, I don\'t
understand what difference it makes, but I guess if this is the course
of action the restaurant owner is pursuing, he should probably just
close up shop now, or sell his restaurant to an owner who is more
compassionate.]{.rendered_qtext}
