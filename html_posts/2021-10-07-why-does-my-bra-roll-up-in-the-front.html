Most bras are designed to push breasts up to provide support for them.
The lower band of the bra is what causes that upward force. Sometimes,
that band will roll up in the front if your breasts are too small for
the bra you have, or if you have bought a bigger bra than your chest
size. It can also happen if your tummy bumps into it after you sit down
(the dreaded baby belly can mess with your bra).

So how do you fix this?

Make sure you are sizing yourself properly:

And then when shopping, make sure you look closely at the size chart on
the bra, find your actual bra size, and select an appropriately sized
bra for your actual bra size. In some cases, you may need a smaller bra
than you think.

Enjoy!
