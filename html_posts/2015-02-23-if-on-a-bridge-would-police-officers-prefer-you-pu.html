**Content:** [Most departments use the \"safest stop location\" rule
when directing their officers on how to make a traffic stop. Officers
will direct you to the safest location in which to stop your vehicle,
either by waiting until you have passed the bridge, or directing you via
the overhead PA system in the patrol car where to stop your vehicle.\
\
Regardless, if the officer initiates the stop on the bridge, by all
means, stop on the bridge. If he wants you to continue past the bridge,
he will indicate this using the PA system.]{.rendered_qtext}
