Potentially. A Bloomberg article said it best: "A federal prosecutor
focused on protecting the integrity of the judicial process, and armed
with persuasive evidence of intentional leaking, will almost certainly
be able to present charges to a federal grand jury."

Here's some of the potential charges the leaker could face:

> **Corruptly Influencing an Official Proceeding**
>
> Enacted with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 18 U.S.C. ยง 1512(c)(2)
> makes it criminal to, among other things, corruptly influence an
> "official proceeding." The issuance of an opinion certainly is part of
> an official proceeding, and, depending on the evidence, it is
> foreseeable that a law clerk could seek to corruptly (that is,
> wrongly, as in *United States v. Nordean*) influence a proceeding by,
> say, changing the outcome of the justices' vote or the scope of the
> court's holding, through external pressure, threat, intimidation, or
> otherwise.
>
> **Theft of Government Property**
>
> The taking of the confidential work product of the justices may also
> implicate 18 U.S.C. ยง 641, because, broadly described, it is the theft
> of government "property." Perhaps the law clerk "stole" the paper
> ("thing of value") on which the ruling was printed. If, as is likely,
> the value of the thing stolen is under \$1,000, however, we are in
> misdemeanor territory.
>
> The more substantive question, characterized by a current circuit
> split, is whether confidential "information" qualifies as a "thing of
> value." As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit put it
> more than 40 years ago, the government has a "property interest in
> certain of its private records which it may protect by statute as a
> thing of value."
>
> It is hard to disagree. After all, federal courts decide issues of

> **Disclosure of Confidential Information**
>
> The disclosure of confidential court information might also fit well

Original answer:

Did the person who leaked Samuel Alito\'s draft opinion of the US
Supreme Court\'s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade violate any laws?
