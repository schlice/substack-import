**What are the chances of getting a refund on a red light camera ticket
after the law has been overturned?**

This is the same as asking about getting your burglary charge thrown out
because a year later, they changed the burglary law, and what you did
became "unauthorized borrowing."

The legal principle at play here is that convictions are predicated on
the laws in place *at the time of the offense*. If you were found guilty
of a crime when a law existed, that's the law you are under. If the law
changes the very next day, you're still out of luck, because
prosecutions happen based on the law at the time of the offense. The
same holds true of red light camera tickets or any other traffic
infraction.

Looks like you're just unlucky on this one. Sorry.
