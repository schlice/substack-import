**About 75m poor Americans rely on Medicaid for their health care, how
would Trump administration\'s new rule of forced to work impact them?**

Yes, as of 2017, there are approximately 74 million low-income Americans
who are covered by Medicaid.

Medicaid is a "means-tested" program, which means that a determination
is made whether an individual or family is eligible for government
assistance. That determination is based on whether the individual or
family possesses the "means" to do without that help. Part of the
"means" includes the ability to find gainful employment.

Note that many people on Medicaid are disabled, and also receive
Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or Social Security Disability (SSD)
money. These people, clearly, do not have the ability to work, and so
would be unaffected by any requirement to search for a job. Also covered
by Medicaid are low-income seniors 65 and older, who are also not
subject to any work requirements.

Any "welfare-to-work" program adds the stipulation that those who have
the ability to work and are of working age must at least attempt to find
gainful employment. Today, these requirements are governed by the
states, not the Federal government. The latest example of this was
Arkansas' work requirements for Medicaid, stripping about 4300
recipients of coverage for failing to meet the state's work requirements
in September of 2018. This is the first time that a state has actually
removed recipients from Medicaid for failing to follow state rules
regarding work.

The Trump administration supports these rules as states impose them,
assuming that they do so fairly, and not with the goal of "just kicking
people off of Medicaid." The goal is to ensure that beneficiaries have
control by providing them with the right incentives to live healthier,
independent lives. For example, Kentucky's program did not meet those
goals, and was rejected. But Indiana, New Hampshire, and eight other
states are currently either asking for, or are implementing, work
requirements for the able-bodied.
