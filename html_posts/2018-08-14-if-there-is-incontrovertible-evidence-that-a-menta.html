**The short answer is no, unless the defendant pleads** ***not guilty by
reason of insanity.***

Until we're able to read minds, I don't think there will ever be
incontrovertible evidence that anyone did anything. The legal standard
in this country is "beyond a reasonable doubt."

If the defendant wants to avoid the death penalty, he must plead not
guilty by reason of insanity. Tennessee allows this defense, but Billy
Ray Irick did not plead not guilty by reason of insanity.

In his trial, the defense called no witnesses and Billy did not testify.
The only person to testify to his significant mental issues was a
clinical social worker.

Tennessee uses the Model Penal Code test to determine whether or not
someone can be held criminally liable with diminished mental capacity.
The MPC test says that in order to be held responsible, the defendant
needed to be unable to either:

1.  Appreciate the criminality of his conduct; or
2.  Conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.

Since Dr. Tennison testified that there was no evidence of mental
illness that would have prevented Billy from knowing the wrongfulness of
his conduct, *even if* he pled not guilty by reason of insanity, he
would not have prevailed.

During his many appeals, questions were raised regarding his mental
state at the time of the killing. These appeals were rejected.

There was ample opportunity to stop the execution if the state felt that
Billy's diminished mental capacity due to mental illness had
significantly impaired his ability to appreciate that what he was doing
was wrong. The state did not feel that this was the case.
