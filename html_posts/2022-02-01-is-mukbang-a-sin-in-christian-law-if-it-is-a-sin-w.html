Mukbang by itself, or by its nature alone, is not sinful. It's a show
about eating.

However, mukbang promotes unhealthy eating habits, and could potentially
glamorize gluttony. A study found that people who frequently watch
mukbang may be more susceptible to having poor eating habits and feel
the impulse to eat food whenever it can be
seen.[\[1\]](#kbbla){#cite-kbbla .citation_link}

This is the danger that Christians face. Christians can watch mukbang,
but they should be on guard, especially if they already have poor
impulse control. It may lead them to the sin.
