**Content:** [The military is a brotherhood steeped in tradition. You\'d
be hard pressed to find anyone willing to change that.\
\
Marching music simply provides a rhythm (at 120 beats per minute) that
everyone can march to. It can be done without the music too; all you
need is a bass drum and a snare drum and you can march to it.\
\
The music describes patriotism and love of country. You should look up
some of the words to those old songs. They are very moving, and they
help to remind the soldier of the heritage of sacrifice that came before
them.\
\
So I don\'t think it\'s going to change anytime soon.]{.rendered_qtext}
