First of all, the lawsuit against Remington brought by the Sandy Hook
parents was thrown out of court. Remington is in no way responsible for
what an insane person does with their firearms.

**But that's not the same for cigarette manufacturers.**

Those wonderful societal specimens not only *knew* that cigarette smoke
was toxic and dangerous, they *suppressed* that information, and they
actively marketed their death sticks to people, knowing full well that
cigarette smoke contained hundreds of known airborne toxins, and caused
all manner of illnesses, including cancer.

You can contact an attorney if you or a loved one suffered harm as a
result of exposure to cigarette smoke and you can individually file a
lawsuit against the tobacco company for compensation. Compensation may
be granted for any of the following types of losses:

- Emergency medical treatment;
- Other health care bills and expenses;
- Required medication or medical devices;
- Loss of current and future income;
- Pain and suffering;
- Permanent disability or disfigurement; and
- Wrongful death.

Contact an attorney in your jurisdiction who specializes in
tobacco-related claims to help you.
