**Content:** [*If your right in what you say, then how can states like
California and New York prevent you from buying assault rifles.*\
\
First of all, the \"assault weapons\" ban expired (rightly), but states
can impose restrictions to Constitutional rights if the restriction
furthers a compelling state need, and the restriction does so in the
\"least restrictive\" manner to the right.\
\
*Yes you have the right to a weapon, but there are and can be
restrictions placed upon it. Any gun owner who thinks he/she is to good
to take a firearms safety class has no business owning a gun. Again if
you can\'t be bothered with learning how to use, handle and store a
weapon, then you don\'t deserve or want it.*\
\
You must be cautious in mandating things like training, because doing so
can actually restrict access to firearms by making it so that only
people who can afford the training will be able to possess guns, and
that is tantamount to preventing an entire class of people (the poor)
from owning guns.\
\
There are a difference between rights and liberties. You\'re right that
rights can\'t be taken away, but liberties can be.\
\
In the United States, guns are rights. Like it or not, that\'s how
strongly the Framers felt that people should be allowed to possess them.
They made it a right, just like the right to life and liberty, the right
to keep and bear arms is right up there.\
\
*Guns are a liberty, they can be taken away if you\'re a wife beater, a
felon and numerous other reasons and you don\'t get the liberty of a
trial.*\
\
Guns are a right, but that right can be restricted if it meets a
compelling state interest. Protecting women from wife beaters is a
significant enough state interest that those accused lose their guns.
They get them back, but to protect women, the right is temporarily
restricted. Felons are adjudicated in court, so you do get a trial.\
\
*Yes the majority of gun owners are responsible and follow the laws, but
if you want to keep your guns and keep politicians off your back then
take the extra effort to show them that you are deserving of that
weapon.*\
\
To exercise a right, you do not need to show why you want to exercise
that right. You don\'t need to show that you deserve to exercise that
right. If it\'s a right, it cannot be infringed.]{.rendered_qtext}
