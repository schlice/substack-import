The answer is that you don\'t understand what being a fiscal
Conservative is.

Being a fiscal Conservative doesn\'t mean never spending money.

Being a fiscal Conservative does mean spending money on the things that
the government is mandated to do under the Constitution, and to avoid
spending money on things that are not part of the government\'s charter.

A fiscal Conservative looks to the Constitution to determine what it is
that the government should be spending money on. Since the Constitution
requires that the government raise and train a standing army, this is
something that we can spend money on. The Constitution requires the
government to promote the general welfare, and to do that, you need
electricity, sanitation, police and fire services, roads, etc. These are
all programs which fiscal Conservatives fully support as well.

And the statement that \"we spend more than the next 8 countries put
together\" is a useless fact. Does the fact that we spend more than
other countries mean that it is irresponsible or wrong to do so? Hardly.
There are many reasons that we spend so much on the military, but I\'ll
