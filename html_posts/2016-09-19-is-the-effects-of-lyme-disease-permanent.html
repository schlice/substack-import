This is a question that is far more in-depth than a simple yes or no
answer could provide.

There are two competing schools of thought. The first is championed by
the 300-pound playground bully, the American Medical Association (AMA).
They claim that you can contract Lyme from a tick bite, and you are then
treated with antibiotics and are cured. If you don't get treatment, most
cases of Lyme resolve themselves with no long-term ill effects. They
disregard the possibility that Lyme persists in any form in the body for
any length of time beyond about a month or two.

*Except that's not the whole story.*

There is another whole category of doctors who are colloquially known as
"Lyme-Literate" MDs (LLMDs). These doctors are represented by a
(strikingly large) international medical organization known as the
[[International Lyme and Associated Disease Society
(ILADS)](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=55d09b&url=http://www.ilads.org/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="ilads.org"}]{.qlink_container}. These doctors know that the
disease is caused by a spiral-shaped bacteria (spirochete) called
Borrelia Burgdorferi, usually transmitted through a tick bite. The Lyme
spirochete can cause infection of multiple organs and produce a wide
range of symptoms. Once the disease has progressed beyond its active
state, the bacteria can go into a dormant form and remain in the bone
marrow for ***decades*** undetected, and not detectable through ELISA
tests. Stress and other factors can cause the bacteria to activate and
can wreak havoc on the body, causing varied symptoms such as
bladder/bowel symptoms, brain fog, and many other symptoms.

The Centers For Disease Control And Prevention (CDC) surveillance
criteria for Lyme disease were devised to track a narrow band of cases
for epidemiologic purposes. As stated on the CDC website, the
surveillance criteria were never intended to be used as diagnostic
criteria, nor were they meant to define the entire scope of Lyme
disease. The ELISA Lyme screening test, which was based on the CDC
surveillance criteria, is unreliable. The test misses 35% of culture
proven Lyme disease (only 65% sensitivity) and is unacceptable as the
first step of a two-step screening protocol (by definition, a screening
test should have at least 95% sensitivity). *Yet this is the test that
the AMA endorses to determine whether or not someone has Lyme!*

Interestingly, fewer than 50% of patients with Lyme disease recall a
tick bite. In some studies this number is as low as 15% in
culture-proven infection with the Lyme spirochete. The same ratio of
patients never recall finding a rash on their bodies, either. Although
the erythema migrans (EM) or "bull's-eye" rash is considered classic, it
is not the most common skin sign of early Lyme infection. Atypical forms
of this rash are seen far more commonly. It is important to know that
the EM rash is always indicative of Lyme disease and requires no further
verification prior to starting an appropriate course of antibiotic
therapy.

Finally, it's important to understand that there is a great deal of
controversy between the two groups of physicians. So in many cases,
LLMDs keep a low profile because they are afraid of being shunned in the
larger AMA, and being labelled as quacks. The 300-pound playground bully
says the way it is, and that's that.

The important thing for you to know, questioner, is that **chronic Lyme
can be successfully treated!** How do I know? ***I'm living proof.***

I would strongly suggest you find a Lyme-Literate MD in your local area.
They understand how to 1. properly search for the bacteria, and if you
are positive, 2. properly treat it. The treatment is not easy, and it is
not quick. But if you do it, you can get back to a normal life. Use
these searches to find a doctor who can help you.

There are also lots of sites out there dedicated to helping people with
chronic Lyme, who have been ignored by mainstream doctors.

Good luck!
