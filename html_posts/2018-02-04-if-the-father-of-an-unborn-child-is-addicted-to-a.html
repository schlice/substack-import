There's a lot of great information here from some really wonderful
people, but none of it really answered the question.

There are two components to addiction. One of them is a predisposition
to addictive behavior, and the other is exposure to addictive
activities.

It is currently unknown how addictive behavior actually, physically
works in the brain. We know the mechanism in the brain which
malfunctions during addiction, but we don't know *why*. Because we don't
know why that area of the brain malfunctions, we have no idea if that
malfunction is genetic or environmental or hereditary. We know what's
broken, but we don't know why it's broken. I know personally several
parents who used drugs and then just quit, cold turkey, without any
(known) side effects, who went on to have kids who became full-blown
addicts, and they **wrestle** with the fact that it was *so easy* for
them to simply quit, but a) their kids use, and b) their kids can't
stop. So we know that the broken bit in the brain which leads to
addiction is not necessarily, 100%, hereditary.

As for exposure to addictive behaviors, it may be that the old PSA from
the 80's is still true: *Parents who use drugs will have children who
use drugs.* Do you remember that PSA (assuming you are old enough to
remember it)?

Well for those of you who missed it (or who were born after it quit
airing), here it is:

I seriously can't tell you whether or not this is true, but I do know
that if you combine both the addictive personality (the broken bit in
the brain that leads to addiction) and exposure to addictive behaviors
(may not necessarily be drugs or alcohol, could be gambling, or Internet
porn, or any number of addictive behaviors) there is a much higher
likelihood that someone will become an addict.
