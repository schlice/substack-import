**Content:** [You are likely adolescent or young adult, right? You have
brand-new hormones coursing through your veins. You are a normal young
adult.\
\
If you\'re 40 and you\'re still thinking about girls \"every six
seconds,\" there may be an issue.\
\
Know that for the most part, this is normal. This is your body telling
you that you\'re at the prime physical age to make new people, and your
body has this desire to make new people (otherwise known as
procreating).\
\
Now, be an adult, and control yourself. Keep your thoughts to yourself.
You\'ll find someone. If you have found someone, share those thoughts
with them.]{.rendered_qtext}
