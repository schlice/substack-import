You're talking about my wife.

Sure, I have a passion for writing about Christianity on Quora, but
she's something different. She, admittedly, doesn't "think on her feet."
She can't formulate arguments or deeper understanding on the fly, in a
conversation. She'd be in a conversation with other Christians, and
then, like a half hour later, would say, "Ah, I know what I should have
told them..." **But when she stops, sits in the quiet, and thinks about
what she is going to say**, especially when she aims to write it down,
*the Spirit floods her with words*, and her writing is literally *so
inspirational* that people have literally taken her words and printed
them on postcards.

postcards)*

She has the innate ability to hear the words of the Spirit and write
them down.

The forty or so authors of the books of the Bible had exactly the same
gift. It's the gift we, today, would call the gift of **prophesy.** It
is a rare and special gift. Treasure the ones in your life who have it.
