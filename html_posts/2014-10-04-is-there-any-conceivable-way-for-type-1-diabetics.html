Unfortunately, diabetes is a [[disqualifying medical
condition](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3a3953&url=http://navy.army.com/info/join/medical){.external_link

However, your drive and dedication can be put to other uses. You can
hire on with a government contractor who contracts with the Navy, still
do Navy work, but just not in uniform. The government has increasingly
been turning formerly military-only duties over to civilians following
the A-76 Outsourcing and Privatization cost-cutting measures implemented
several years ago.

And even if medical conditions disqualify you from military service (as
mine did after I joined), your life is not purposeless; you must believe
this. Even this has a purpose. You just don\'t see it yet. Please don\'t
feel like you\'re giving up your dream, just know that your purpose lies
elsewhere. You will still be fulfilled in life, it will just look a
little different.
