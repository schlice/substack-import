**How can I go about using my HOA, because people are building a strip
mall behind my house and was not aware of informed on the decision? What
can I do? This will invade my privacy and I will no longer feel safe.**

I think you meant to ask how you can go about "suing" your HOA because
of things going on behind your house.

Your HOA is not responsible for telling you about ongoing building
projects in areas outside of their control. So you can't really sue them
for not doing something that they were not required to do in the first
place.

Secondly, if the area was zoned correctly, you should have known that
the area behind your house was commercial property and that it could
have had commercial buildings built on it. If it wasn't zoned for
commercial, then the city would have had to re-zone it in order to
approve the building there, and you would have been notified by the city
of the zoning change.

Finally, you are not locked into your house. You can always sell it and
leave if you don't feel safe.
