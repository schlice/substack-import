**Content:** [High speed car chases are going the way of the dodo.\
\
Many jurisdictions have banned them outright. Some jurisdictions are
\"positive consent\" jurisdictions for pursuit. The on-duty sergeant
must authorize the pursuit before it can continue, and it will only be
authorized in extenuating circumstances, during low traffic periods, and
for severe crimes. It will be rare all other times.\
\
The vehicle will not be tracked by helicopter, since the department does
not routinely fly the helicopter and it does take time to get into the
air and on scene. Generally, the officer simply takes the registration
of the vehicle and follows up on it later.]{.rendered_qtext}
