**In the United States, what happens if I call the wrong police
jurisdiction during an emergency (like for example the wrong city\'s
police)? Would the dispatcher be able to reroute the call?**

The 911 system will route you to the nearest dispatcher.

In cases of concurrent jurisdiction, the dispatcher will connect you to
the dispatcher for any more appropriate jurisdictions.

You only need to remember 911 for an emergency.
