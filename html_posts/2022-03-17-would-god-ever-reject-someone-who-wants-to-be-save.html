No.

God will never turn away those with a *willing* heart. Even people that
you wouldn't expect can be saved. Just look at the Bible. Even the
criminal who was crucified beside Jesus was saved. He saved prostitutes
and thieves.

And the one thing they had in common was a repentant heart and a willing
spirit. They had *faith*, and their faith in Christ was what saved them.
