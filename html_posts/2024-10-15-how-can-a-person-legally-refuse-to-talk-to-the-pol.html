Whether or not you have fear is not something which can be legislated.
We can only discuss what the law says.

As long as you **verbally state** that you are exercising your Fifth
Amendment right to remain silent, **your silence cannot be used against
you in a** ***criminal*** **proceeding***.* The Fifth Amendment
prohibits judges and juries from drawing any "adverse inferences"
against you for not testifying. For example, let's say you have been
charged with assault. You decide not to testify at trial. The judge
cannot then instruct the jury that it can infer your guilt based on your
silence. After all, that would defeat the entire purpose of the right
against self-incrimination.

However, we need to drive this point home: *you must* ***verbally***
***state*** *that you are exercising your right to remain silent*; you
can't just not speak at all.

This is important. **Silence can be used against you**. Stating that you
are exercising your 5th Amendment right to not answer questions
**cannot** be used against you, but just sitting there like a bump on a
hump not speaking any words ***can*** be used against you.

I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, "If I am trying to remain
silent, why do I have to **not remain silent** in order to remain
silent?"

It totally reminds me of this:

*(If the page is supposed to be blank, then why is the page not blank?)*

The reason is that you don't really have a right to *remain silent*,
meaning you don't have a right to not speak words. You have a right to
*remain silent*, meaning you have a right to not answer questions which
may incriminate you (i.e. all of them). So you can **say** that you are
not going to answer questions, but in order to invoke that right to not
answer questions, you must verbally and unambiguously state that you are
not going to answer questions.

\

It's also important to note that the 5th Amendment only applies to
***criminal*** cases (i.e. when you're arrested by the police). In a
***civil*** case (i.e. where you are facing a lawsuit), the judge
**can** draw an "adverse inference" from your silence.
