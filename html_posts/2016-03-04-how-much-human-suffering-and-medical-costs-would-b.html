Some facts to consider:

- There are currently 121,678 people waiting for lifesaving organ\
  transplants in the U.S. Of these, 100,791 await kidney transplants
  (as\
  of 1/11/16).
- The median wait time for an individual's first kidney transplant is\
  3.6 years and can vary depending on health, compatibility and\
  availability of organs.
- In 2014, 17,107 kidney transplants took place in the US. Of these,\
  11,570 came from deceased donors and 5,537 came from living donors.

On average:

- Over **3,000** new patients are added to the kidney waiting list each
  month.
- **13** people die each day while waiting for a life-saving kidney
  transplant.
- Every **14** minutes someone is added to the kidney transplant list.
- In 2014, **4,761** patients died while waiting for a kidney
  transplant. Another, **3,668** people became too sick to receive a
  kidney transplant. \[1\]

However, at least in the United States, you can\'t compel anyone to
undergo such a risky procedure as a voluntary kidney removal. There are
many considerations a living donor has to make before deciding to donate
a kidney.

Besides the donor needing to be in good physical condition and able to
withstand a major surgery under general anesthesia, someone who has
cancer, diabetes, kidney disease, heart disease, liver disease, sickle
cell disease, HIV or hepatitis will generally not qualify to be a donor.
Cancer alone knocks 39% of the population out. Another 610,000 Americans
will be diagnosed with some form of heart disease.

But even if you could provide kidneys for everyone on the transplant
list, that\'s still only about 120,000 people from a \"forced\" donor
pool of about 50 million qualified people.

What should be done is more education to let people know that living
kidney donations is relatively safe (as safe as any other general
surgery) and carries limited risk of future complications. Most
generally, people who have donated a kidney go on to live full lives
with only one.

We should also encourage more people to become donors postmortem. Most
states have an organ donation program which allows people to register to
become organ and tissue donors when they apply for, or renew, their
driver\'s licenses. In fact, the majority of kidneys donated (more than
double) came from deceased donors.
