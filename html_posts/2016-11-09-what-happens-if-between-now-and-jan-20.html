Specifically for the rape charge, it depends on the state. Most states
have a statute of limitations of anywhere from 3 years to 30 years. Some
states have no statutes of limitations on rape at all.

So let's assume that there was DNA evidence and an indictment followed
from the state in which the alleged rape took place, and the state has
either a very long statute of limitations (25 years or longer) or no
statute of limitations at all on rape. He would not be arrested, he
would be *indicted*. He might be asked to turn himself in, but as the
president-elect, it seems unlikely. He's certainly not a flight risk. An
indictment does not stop the presidential inauguration process from
proceeding, nor does it prevent the president-elect from assuming
office. Trump would assume office as normal. Congress could then impeach
the president and remove him from office, and the Vice President would
become President. They could also potentially refuse to certify the
results of the election, but that would be a massive mistake as it would
invoke a constitutional crisis.
