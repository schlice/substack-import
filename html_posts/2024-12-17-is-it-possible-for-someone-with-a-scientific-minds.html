Of course it is!

And the greatest example of this is none other than Mr. Crazy Hair
himself, Albert Einstein.

In 1916, Einstein (an atheist at the time) was confronted with a
troubling implication of his theory of General Relativity. If correct,
the theory suggested that the universe had not always existed but had a
starting point. This was a stark contrast to his previous conviction
that the universe was unchanging and eternal. His own calculations were
pointing to an absolute beginning of all time, matter, and space, and he
was troubled.

Einstein would later go on to describe his discovery as \"irritating.\"
He had hoped for a universe that was self-sustaining, not dependent on
an external cause, yet it seemed to be one massive effect. Indeed,
Einstein was so troubled by the consequences of General Relativity---a
theory now verified to five decimal places---that he inserted a
*cosmological constant* (later termed by some as a \"fudge factor\")
into his equations to depict the universe as static and circumvent an
absolute beginning.

But Einstein's fudge factor didn't fudge for long. In 1919, British
cosmologist Arthur Eddington carried out an experiment during a solar
eclipse that confirmed the validity of General Relativity, revealing
that the universe was not static but had a beginning. Similar to
Einstein, Eddington was troubled by the implications. He expressed his
discomfort by writing, \"Philosophically, the idea of a beginning to the
current order of nature is distasteful to me. \[\...\] I would like to
find a genuine loophole.\"

By 1922, Russian mathematician Alexander Friedmann had officially
revealed Einstein\'s "fudge factor" to be an algebraic mistake
(astonishingly, in his effort to preclude a beginning, Einstein had
divided by zero). Concurrently, Dutch astronomer Willem de Sitter had
determined that General Relativity necessitated an expanding universe.
Furthermore, in 1927, the expansion of the universe was empirically
observed by astronomer Edwin Hubble, after whom the space telescope is
named. Using the 100-inch telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory in
California, Hubble observed a \"red shift\" in the light from every
visible galaxy, indicating that these galaxies were moving away from
Earth. This discovery provided further confirmation of General
Relativity, suggesting that the universe is expanding from an initial
point in the distant past.

In 1929, Einstein visited Mount Wilson to personally observe the "red
shift" through Hubble\'s telescope. The irrefutable observations
confirmed that the universe was expanding, as predicted by General
Relativity. This evidence rendered Einstein\'s cosmological constant
totally and completely obsolete, leading him to abandon his preference
for a static universe. He famously called the cosmological constant
\"the greatest blunder of my life\" and shifted his focus to unraveling
the mysteries of life. Einstein expressed his desire to understand the
Creator\'s blueprint, stating, \"I want to know how God created the
world. I am not interested in this or that phenomenon, in the spectrum
of this or that element. I want to know His thoughts; the rest are
details.\"

Although Einstein said that he believed in a pantheistic God (a god that
*is* the universe), his comments admitting creation and divine thought
better describe a theistic God. And as "irritating" as it may be, his
theory of General Relativity stands today as one of the strongest lines
of evidence supporting the existence of a theistic God.
