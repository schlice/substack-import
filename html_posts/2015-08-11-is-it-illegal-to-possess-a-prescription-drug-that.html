**Content:** [In most places in the United States, it is illegal to
possess a prescription medication which has not been prescribed to you.
In most states, the charge is unlawful possession of prescription
medication. The charge is much more serious if the medication is a
controlled substance.\
\
Whether or not you ***do*** get charged will depend on circumstances,
such as what the drug is, who it was prescribed to, and the
circumstances under which it came into your possession. For example, if
you drove your grandmother to the hospital and the police find her
medicine in your car, you won\'t likely be charged. However, if her
prescription is for painkillers and you get stopped and you are under
the influence, you can get charged with DUI and unlawful possession
and/or use of prescription medication.]{.rendered_qtext}
