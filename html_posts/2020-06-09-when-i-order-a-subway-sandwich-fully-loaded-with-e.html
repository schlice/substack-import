**When I order a subway sandwich, fully loaded with every option
available, how do they make any profit at all from me?**

One of my good friends owned two Subway stores in town. Every time I'd
go in there and he was in the store, he'd give me my sandwich for free.
I felt bad for that, and I told him so.

He waved me off. "These things cost me pennies to make," he said.

He wasn't entirely accurate in terms of actual dollars and cents. In
actuality, it only costs about \$2 in ingredients to make a Subway
sandwich. But Subway still needs to pay for other things, like rent,
electricity, and salaries for employees. Anyone who has been an avid
watcher of *Restaurant: Impossible* or any such "save my restaurant"
show knows that a simple formula to determine retail price of a plate in
a restaurant is three times the actual product cost. So that Subway sub
should be selling for about \$6. It costs a Subway franchise well over
\$4 *all in* for each sandwich, and so the math works: \$6 is
reasonable, factoring in reasonable profit, not just break-evenness.

Which is why the [[\$5 Footlong promotion nearly bankrupted
Subway.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c56904&url=https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-subway-foot-long-promotion-20171229-story.html){.external_link

There is a big disconnect between Subway corporate and its franchisees.
It's almost like they don't want their franchisees to make any profit at
all.
