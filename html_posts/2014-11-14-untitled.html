<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [The trust between the police and the public is a big one,
and the trust is easily broken. I think this is primarily because the
public trusts the police so implicitly (I always learned \"the man in
blue is a friend to you\" as a childhood mantra). The \"badge of
office\" is a symbol of public trust. That\'s also why it hurts so much
when an officer violates that trust.\
\
I\'ll clue you in on something else: it hurts other officers when one of
their own violates the public trust.]{.rendered_qtext}
