<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [The trust between the police and the public is a big one,<br>and the trust is easily broken. I think this is primarily because the<br>public trusts the police so implicitly (I always learned \"the man in<br>blue is a friend to you\" as a childhood mantra). The \"badge of<br>office\" is a symbol of public trust. That\'s also why it hurts so much<br>when an officer violates that trust.\<br>\<br>I\'ll clue you in on something else: it hurts other officers when one of<br>their own violates the public trust.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Do-law-enforcement-officers-see-any-reason-why-they-shouldnt-be-filmed-at-all-times-while-on-duty/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
