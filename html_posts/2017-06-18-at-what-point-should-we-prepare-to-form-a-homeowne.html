Oh, you should most definitely begin right now.

The main reason: the builder controls the remaining 40% of incomplete
units, and casts the votes on them. If you want to enact a
homeowner-operated HOA, it will never be easier to do than right now,
especially if you have the endorsement of your builder. You generally
need a 2/3 majority of homeowners to vote in changes to your covenants
(or to approve the formation of a new covenants), so if the builder
approves 40% of the vote, you only need 26% of the remaining homeowners
to approve the HOA and it's in.

We were even better off when we started: our neighborhood was only 50%
complete when we modified our covenants to form a homeowner-operated
HOA. We had broad approval from the actual owner-occupied units, but
having 50% of the neighborhood voting yes made the process very easy.

Your builder should help you with the process. You'll need a management
company, an attorney to draw up the documents and file them with the
city, and an initial HOA board. If you're fortunate, the builder will
actually chip in some of the money needed for the attorney's fees. You
should recommend that if it's in the builder's best interest for you to
form an HOA, they can help with the upfront cost. You can modify your
association dues to pay ongoing fees later on, but the builder should
chip in to make the requisite changes to get the thing off the ground.

Even though you only need 26% of the remaining homeowners to approve the
change, keep your homeowners in the loop. This is 2017; go online!
Establish a website (another upfront cost) and get your homeowners to
build accounts on that site where they can pay their dues. There are
tons of HOA website hosts out there that provide this service and more;
integrate online services early into your HOA model. You'll enjoy
faster, easier payment of dues, fewer late payments, and better
communications with your homeowners.

Finally, make sure your HOA provides value to your homeowners. What
services will you provide? What benefits will your homeowners see from
making this move? Hopefully, they will see transparency in how their
dues are spent, and they will have a hand in making those decisions. The
biggest benefit your homeowners will see is more control over how the
community is run, and more transparency in how community money is spent.
But the services you can offer, and thus the value you can offer your
homeowners, is only limited by your imagination.
