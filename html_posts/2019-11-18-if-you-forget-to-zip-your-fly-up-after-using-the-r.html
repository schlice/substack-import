**If you forget to zip your fly up after using the restroom and people
see your genitals, can you get into legal trouble?**

As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends." However, for
most circumstances, an inadvertent or unintentional exposure of genitals
is not something for which you would be charged.

The reason: in *most* states, in order to be charged with indecent
exposure, you must **purposefully** display genitals **with the intent
to sexually arouse.**

To that end, there are two areas in the laws of most states which will
prevent you from being charged, and they both involve intent:

1.  *Purposeful conduct*. This means purposefully exposing yourself for
    any reason, including reasons unrelated to sex. You could be drunk
    and urinating against a wall; this sort of exposure is generally
    considered purposeful. You indicated in your question that you
    accidentally left your clothing open. This does not indicate the
    purposeful conduct needed for an indecent exposure charge.
2.  *Intent to sexually arouse*. This portion of the statute is usually
    the one that differs by state. For example, Colorado says that in
    order to be indecent exposure, the exposure must be intended to
    sexually arouse. In order to be indecent exposure in Colorado,
    therefore, the subject must be performing some action which could
    reasonably be assumed to be an attempt to sexually arouse (such as
    suggestively touching themselves). Just being naked in your own
    backyard in Colorado wouldn't constitute indecent exposure. However,
    in New Jersey, if you are exposing in an area where someone who has
    not affirmatively consented to seeing you naked can see you, you can
    be charged with indecent exposure. So same backyard example, but
    someone could possibly see you from a second story window in the
    house next door, and you can be charged.

Note that each state runs its indecent exposure laws differently, and
this may vary from state to state.
