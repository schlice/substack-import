**Content:** [(Original question answered here was \"Out of 100 people
in a society, how many should be police officers to ensure a peaceful
society?\")\
\
There is no number high enough to force peace on the population. You
can\'t \"force peace\" as those two concepts are mutually exclusive.\
\
The real answer is that you can never \"ensure a peaceful society,\"
because society is made up of people, and people don\'t always behave in
the way you expect everyone to behave in an ordered society.\
\
In order to have peaceful society, everyone must agree to live by the
rules, which exist to ensure that my peaceful existence is not
interrupted by your peaceful existence. It is in the intersection of
these two peaceful existences that arguments occur. It will always be
this way. Personal interactions are messy and tense and sometimes spill
over into anger and violence.\
\
Unless **people** change, societies will always be this way.\
(Newly re-worded question now reads: \"How would a smoothly running,
autonomous society with 1,000 members employ each of its members?\"\
\
To answer this question, we must add one more piece to the hypothetical:
*Will this be a society based on money, and will it be a free-market
economy?*\
\
If the answer is \"no\", then you can lay it out however you like. You
can make as many or as few as you like, and there would be no
consequences.\
\
If the answer is \"yes,\" then you don\'t have to do anything. If you
leave it alone, the free market economy will automatically determine how
many of each specialty is needed. The exception is for the \"essential
services personnel\" like police and fire (i.e. provided by government),
of whom you have exactly as many as you need to efficiently handle the
entire volume of service calls.\
\
For example, if you have only one piano tuner, but there is enough work
for five piano tuners, then four more people will become piano tuners
and will start working. But if you have three piano tuners but there is
only enough work for two, the worst piano tuner will go out of business
and will have to find other gainful employment.]{.rendered_qtext}
