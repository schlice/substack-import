**What do you think about President Trump banning women from buying
guns?**

EVEN IF the President had the authority to do such a thing (he does
not), he would never do such a thing. He is a strong supporter of the
2nd Amendment and of *everyone*'s right to keep and bear arms, not just
men.

In the immortal words of DJ Khaled: "Congratulations, you played
yourself."
