**Content:** [Trading in ivory is currently illegal, as is the
international sale of any new ivory products. However, there is a
thriving black market for ivory, and it is only getting worse.\
\
There have been calls to legalize ivory and to control the market, but
that has been met with skepticism.\

Simon Jenkins, the BBC journalist and author, [[wrote a

save the elephants, we will have to control the market that poachers are
currently running rampant in. He claims the way to do this is to farm
elephants, much like cattle.\
\
However, Will Travers, President of the Born Free Foundation, [[wrote a
rebuttal](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ed5d1e&url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/02/farming-wont-save-elephants-simon-jenkins-ivory-trade){.external_link

economists that Mr. Bandow quoted are simply wrong, and that the trade
embargos have actually caused the elephant population to stabilize.\

talks about the economics of legalizing the ivory trade. He points out
that economists still see a flourishing (and growing) poaching trade
which will eventually decimate the existing elephant population if
something is not done to control it:\

I have to look at this objectively and say that there should be a legal
market, to save the elephants. African governments are ineffectual in
their ability to control poaching, and it is literally running rampant.
If the indigenous people who are proximate to the elephants already
could help to control the poachers by having a legal market themselves,
we could save the elephants. At this rate of poaching, however, they are
facing an extinction-level event within the next 20 years.
