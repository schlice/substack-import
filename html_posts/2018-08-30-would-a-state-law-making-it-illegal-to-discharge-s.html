**Would a state law making it illegal to discharge specific types of
firearms (say automatic handguns and assault rifles) anywhere except on
a state licensed gun range be ruled unconstitutional under the 2nd
Amendment? You can own it, but not fire it.**

Yes, this is unconstitutional.

In the same way that a 10,000% tax on ammunition is unconstitutional, a
law which states that it is illegal to fire a weapon would violate the
right to keep and "bear" arms. Bearing arms implies the potential use of
that firearm, not just holding them and carrying them.

If a law prevents a gun from being used for a lawful purpose, that would
be considered an unconstitutional law.
