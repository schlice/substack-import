I flew Frontier from Colorado Springs to Las Vegas just a few months
ago, and then I flew Southwest from Denver to Raleigh just a month
later.

**There is literally no comparison. Southwest does not belong in this
category.**

First, a little background. My flight on Frontier was just about an hour
and change, and the aircraft was only a few weeks into service, so it
was one of Frontier's most current offerings. But I have flown with
major airlines like United and Delta, and budget airlines like
Southwest, for many years. This was my first experience on Frontier.

Here's my impressions of Frontier:

1.  Everything is an upgrade. They do offer some of these items (like a
    bag and a seat selection, for example) bundled together for a single
    charge, but everything is only available by purchase.
    1.  You do not get any bags included at all. Your only included item
        is one bag as a personal item that must fit under the seat in
        front of you. If you want to bring a carry-on (regardless of
        where you put it on the plane), it's an extra charge. If you
        want to bring a checked bag, each bag is an extra charge, there
        are no bags included in the ticket price.
    2.  No food or drinks are included in your ticket. Everything is
        purchasable. Granted, they try to make it as convenient as
        possible: you can buy a "snack pack" which includes snacks and a
        drink for one price. But there are no complimentary drinks or
        snacks included at all.
    3.  If you want to choose your seat, you may do so. For an extra
        charge, of course. If you want to save money, you can let
        Frontier place you in a seat of their choosing.
    4.  Not that they ever reclined very far to begin with, but the
        seats don't recline. There were, maybe, three rows with
        reclining seats, which you could choose to sit in. For an extra
        price, of course.
2.  I think the Colorado Springs to Vegas flight is about as long as I
    can stand to sit in those seats. They were horribly uncomfortable.
    The padding was very thin. You could feel the metal bars right
    through the seat padding. And mind you, this aircraft was brand new.
3.  The tray table wasn't much bigger than my cell phone. So much for
    putting the laptop up there to watch movies. The laptop actually had
    to sit, well, in my lap.

On the upside, the lav was beautiful and well-lit. The cabin was also
well-lit, with colored LED lighting. The ventilation worked very well.

In comparison to Southwest:

1.  Southwest gives you two checked bags for free, along with your
    carry-on, and a personal item. All at no additional charge.
2.  On Southwest, you can pick your seat. When you board the plane!
    Southwest has open seating: no assigned seats. While it does take
    slightly longer to board this way, this method has one of the
    highest customer satisfaction ratings of any method of boarding a
    commercial aircraft. Passengers are assigned a group and a numbered
    boarding position. Families traveling with children six and under
    can board together between the A and B groups. You have the option
    to upgrade to the A boarding group for anywhere from \$30 to \$50,
    depending on route.
3.  Southwest crews are genuinely happy. It's genuine. You can see it in
    their faces. They actually enjoy what they do.
4.  Southwest offers complimentary soft drinks and water, along with an
    assortment of snacks which varies by route. They also offer buy on
    board food.
5.  Southwest aircraft include free Wi-Fi on board, which gives you
    access to free movies, an assortment of live television stations,
    and free messaging (limited to iMessage and WhatsApp, which you need
    to have downloaded before you board, since there's no access to the
    App Store or Google Play). You can buy full access to the Internet
    for \$8 per day, regardless of how many flights you take that day.
    While this gives you access to all of your productivity software
    like email and most websites, this excludes access to most movie
    streaming services like Netflix or HBO GO. It also excludes access
    to Voice over IP (VoIP), so no phone calls while on the plane
    (although that may change in the future).

Southwest and Frontier aren't even remotely comparable.
