I'm a Christian, not a Mormon, but even Christians call **solo**
masturbation a sin.

I qualified "solo" because what you do with your spouse together, just
the two of you, in a committed marital relationship, is not sinful, and
that includes mutual masturbation. And the reason is that, while the
Bible does not specifically address masturbation, the Bible does address
God's purpose for sex and marriage.

According to 1 Corinthians 7:2--5:

> Each man should have sexual relations with his own wife, and each
> woman with her own husband. The husband should fulfill his marital
> duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband. The wife does
> not have authority over her own body but yields it to her husband. In
> the same way, the husband does not have authority over his own body
> but yields it to his wife. Do not deprive each other except perhaps by
> mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to
> prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you
> because of your lack of self-control.

Implicit in this passage are these truths:

- God's plan for sex requires *relationship*, namely, that of a husband
  and wife (verse 2). Solo masturbation is sex disconnected from
  relationship.
- Foundational to God's plan for sex is *giving one's body to another*
  (verse 4). Solo masturbation is the keeping of one's body to oneself.
- The solution to a time of deprivation is to "*come together*" (verse
  5). Solo masturbation is done alone, not together.

So right away, we see that solo masturbation is not in keeping with
God's plan for us, and the answers for married couples are all right
there. But there are so many who say that it's good to masturbate by
yourself to equalize the libidos of two sexual partners. It releases
marital tension when one spouse is more sexually active than another,
and therefore builds a healthier marriage, which in itself is
God-honoring. The biblical description of sex in marriage, however,
doesn't allow for that. It says that the woman yields her body to her
husband; it's her responsibility to take care of his needs, just as it's
his responsibility to address her needs. In that way, God's plan for sex
is that spouses give themselves to each other. Any sexual activity apart
from that goal is, therefore, sinful.

Singles say that it's a *physical need* that they must fulfill or they
can't sleep, their work suffers, etc. However, the Bible never presents
sexual fulfillment as a need. On the contrary, Paul says to the
unmarried, "It's better to stay unmarried" (verse 8). Paul continues in
verse 9, where he identifies the proper outlet for single people who
struggle with sexual desire: "If they cannot control themselves, they
should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion." Paul
suggests that self-control (one of the gifts of the Holy Spirit) is the
best answer. To singles who lack self-control, Paul does not say, "Let
them masturbate;" he says, "Let them marry." Again, marriage is the
God-given outlet for sexual tension, not masturbation.

So, is solo masturbation a sin? The Bible does not directly answer this
question, but there definitely are some biblical principles to apply:

1.  "So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the
    glory of God" (1 Corinthians 10:31). If we cannot give God glory for
    something, we should not do it.
2.  "Everything that does not come from faith is sin" (Romans 14:23). If
    we are not fully convinced that an activity is honoring to God, it
    is a sin.
3.  "I will not be mastered by anything" (1 Corinthians 6:12).
    Christians have a responsibility to avoid anything that might
    enslave them.
4.  "I discipline my body and keep it under control" (1 Corinthians
    9:27). Self-denial is difficult, but self-discipline is worth it.
5.  "The fruit of the Spirit is . . . self-control" (Galatians
    5:22--23). Masturbation is almost always a sign of a lack of
    self-control.
6.  Do "not gratify the desires of the flesh. For the flesh desires what
    is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the
    flesh. They are in conflict with each other, so that you are not to
    do whatever you want" (Galatians 5:16--17). We are called to
    self-denial, not to self-gratification.

These truths should have an impact on what we do with our bodies. In
light of the above principles, it is doubtful that solo masturbation can
be a God-honoring activity. If it could be done with

- no lust in the heart
- no immoral thoughts
- no pornography
- no self-gratification of the flesh
- full assurance that it is good and right
- thanks given to God

then perhaps it would be allowable. But those qualifiers seem to negate
the very reasons why people engage in solo masturbation.

So while I commiserate, I cannot condone, Biblically. For these reasons,
I believe solo masturbation is sinful in the vast majority of cases.
