**Why do pilots land planes at high speeds in recent years rather than
letting the plane \"stop flying\" (lose lift from low speed)?**

Ideally, you'd always like to land at lower speed. However, when you're
landing in a crosswind, or when you're landing in squirly winds or gusty
winds, a higher landing speed is used.

Also possible: air density during hot days is lower, requiring a higher
landing speed to keep the wings working. This is actually a very common
issue here in Colorado in the middle of the summer, where density
altitude can exceed 8,000 feet on hot days in Denver. Heat makes the air
thinner, just like altitude does. The combination of heat and altitude
makes it even worse.
