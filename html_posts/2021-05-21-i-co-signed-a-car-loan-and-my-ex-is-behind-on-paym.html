The question is not whether or not you are a co-signer on the loan, but
whether or not you are listed as a co-owner on the title.

Co-signers, by themselves, cannot take possession of a vehicle they are
paying for. Just being a co-signer on the loan doesn't give you rights
to a vehicle for which you are not listed on the title. However, if you
are **on the title as a co-owner**, you have as much right to the
vehicle as your ex.

If you are a co-owner and if you can get to it safely, you can simply
walk up to it with your keys and drive away. You can't be arrested for
driving your own vehicle.

If you can't get to the vehicle, you should talk to the bank. Let them
know which one of you is willing to continue to make payments on the
vehicle, but you are reluctant to do so if you are not in possession of
the vehicle. In that case, maybe you could help the bank locate the
vehicle so they could repossess it and sell it.

If he wants to keep the vehicle, perhaps he could refinance the vehicle
so that he is the sole owner and you are no longer financially
responsible.

But I, like the other answerers, am confused why the car wouldn't have
been addressed in the divorce. I know that wasn't part of the question,
but it is unusual.

**I co-signed a car loan and my ex is behind on payments? What are my
legal options to repossess? I don't want to pay for it if I won't have
it in my possession.**
