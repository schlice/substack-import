**Content:** [I \"rode along\" on an extradition from Colorado to New
York.\

How was it? Very anti-climactic.\
\
Picked him up at the El Paso County CJC, he was handcuffed. Took him to
the airport, walked him around the security checkpoint, got on to the
plane (first), sat in the back of the plane, and once the door was
closed, his handcuffs were removed (it was FAA policy at the time,
don\'t know if it still is). When we landed, the handcuffs went back on,
and we left the plane (last), and he was picked up by uniformed officers
at the end of the jetway. Easy peesey.\
\
There are probably other transports that Federal Marshalls could tell
you about, since for the most part, prisoner transportation is handled
by the U.S. Marshall service.]{.rendered_qtext}
