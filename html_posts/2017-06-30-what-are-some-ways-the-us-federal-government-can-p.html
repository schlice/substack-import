They can pass a law that states that following the Paris accords is a
federal crime. If such a law was to pass (and be found to be
Constitutional, which is unlikely), then states would be bound by that
law as well.

However, the federal government does not have control over
***intrastate*** (i.e. within a state) commerce, only *interstate* (i.e.
between states) commerce. The federal government can't control if a
state decides to enact limits on carbon dioxide emissions on
manufacturers in their state, or tax vehicle drivers based on the amount
they drive (thus determining the amount of greenhouse gases they emit).

States are free to do this. And businesses and people are free to move
to another state. That's how the free market system works. If it's
cheaper to run your business in another state (maybe even just across
the border), then you move there. But how does that improve the
environment? The same emissions are entering the atmosphere, but they
are doing so from another state.

The measure **feels** good, even though it doesn't **do** good.

Nevertheless, the federal government has withheld funding in the past
when states have not complied with federal policy. They may try again.
