**If a president begins to demonstrate that he is incapable of acting in
national interests and shows signs of irrational behavior, are there
practices as means of controlling or removing him short of impeachment
and the 25th amendment?**

No. The answer is ***you don't re-elect him.***

Impeachment is for *high crimes and misdemeanors.\*
The 25th Amendment is used when a President is *unable to carry out the
duties of President.*

**NONE of these remedies are used when a President does something you
don't like.**

You don't impeach or forcibly remove a President when he doesn't act in
a way that you think is the "national interest." There are over 300
million people in this country; the President is probably acting in
*someone*'s interest. And all people act in a way that you don't believe
is *rational* sometimes. Who are you to say?

If you think that the President is not acting in the national interest
or is irrational, you simply don't re-elect him. That is the appropriate
Constitutional remedy for a President you don't like. We've had peaceful
handoff of Presidential authority in this country for almost 250 years.
If you vote him out of office, he will peacefully give up that authority
and leave.
