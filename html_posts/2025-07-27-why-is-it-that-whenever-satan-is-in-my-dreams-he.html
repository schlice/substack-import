I think the answer to your dream question is pretty obvious. I\'ll leave
it at that.

But as for following a *religion*? Don\'t do that. Don\'t follow a
religion. Religions were responsible for the Inquisition and the
Crusades. Religions have been responsible for death and destruction.
Don\'t follow a religion.

Follow Jesus.

Jesus said, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to
the Father except through me." I\'m going to follow that.

Jesus is the one who had over 300 prophesies fulfilled in his lifetime,
things that were written hundreds of years before His birth. How did
they know he was going to die by crucifixion when that form of torture
wasn\'t even invented then? That guy must be the Son of God. I\'m going
to follow that.

Jesus predicted, *and then accomplished,* His own resurrection. And He
claimed to be God. After His resurrection, hundreds of people saw him
alive and testified to seeing Him. The Romans captured them and tortured
them, some to death, for maintaining that belief, when all they would
have had to do was to recant their stories and they could have spared
themselves the torture, but they did not. That\'s how much faith they
put in Jesus.

With bona fides like that, oh you bet I\'m going to follow that.

Do not follow religion. Religions were made by men. Do not put your
faith in religion. It cannot save you.

Follow Jesus. Jesus is God. Faith in Jesus will save you.
