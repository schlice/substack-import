Unfortunately, you must be able to walk in order to join the military.
It is considered a [[disqualifying medical
condition.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e6f666&url=http://www.military.com/join-armed-forces/disqualifiers-medical-conditions.html){.external_link

certain level of mobility; you can see all of those requirements at the
link I posted.
