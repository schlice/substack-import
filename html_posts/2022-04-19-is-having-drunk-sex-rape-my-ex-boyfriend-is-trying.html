Here's the problem.

The basic definition of rape is sexual intercourse without consent.
Consent is a conscious decision to approve of an activity, without
impaired judgement. If you are drunk, your judgement is impaired, so you
cannot give legal consent to sex.

The law says that if you know a person is drunk, and you press forward
with sex, it's considered rape. But it's decidedly less clear-cut if you
are *both* drunk. The details in any given situation vary, so it's
difficult to determine if anyone has consented.

Original question:

Is having drunk sex rape? My ex-boyfriend is trying to claim that I
wanted to get him drunk so we could have sex, but all I ever did is ask
if he would want to have drunk sex and if that would be something he's
interesting in. Is drunk sex rape?
