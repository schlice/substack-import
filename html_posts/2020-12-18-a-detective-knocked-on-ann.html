**A detective knocked on Ann's apartment and asked Ann for a statement
about an acquaintance. Ann said she'll get back to them and took their
card. It's been 5 days. Are they going to come back and talk to Ann or
did it blow over?**

As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."

It depends on how badly the police need her testimony, and how much
their case hinges on learning what she knows.

It also hinges on how closely Ann is tied to the actions of this
acquaintance. Are they asking about something that Ann and the
acquaintance may have done together, or something that the acquaintance
did and that Ann may have direct knowledge of? If so, the police may be
back, and this time, they may ask Ann to come down to the station and
give a statement.

If, however, they merely know that Ann and her acquaintance are just
friends, and they are hoping that the acquaintance told Ann something,
then not getting Ann's testimony may not bother them too badly.

To that end, if the acquaintance didn't tell Ann anything, she should
tell the police as much so that they do leave her alone. They may be
hanging on to some false hope that Ann can help them make their case if
they don't hear anything from her. Ann would remain on the list of
possible corroborating sources, and if they start running into dead
ends, they may try to run down those possible sources.
