The consideration of ridiculousness is based on how well the belief
comports with knowable, observable reality.

If the belief flies in the face of what is knowable, repeatable and
observable, then the belief can be considered ridiculous.

For example, evolutionists believe that DNA just randomly
self-assembled. However, knowable, observable reality tells us that
messages (specified complexity) only come from intelligence. Observation
and repetition tell us that unguided naturalistic processes never create
specified complexity.

So if someone believes (without evidence) that DNA just randomly evolved
out of nothing, then we can rationally call that belief ridiculous.

But if someone believes that God exists, then we can point to the fact
that God specifically exists outside of the physical, so demanding
physical evidence for an immaterial god is not rational. We use the
evidence we do have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that God exists
(the evidence in nature, like DNA, and the truth which is written on to
every human heart).

So such a belief would not be considered to be ridiculous.
