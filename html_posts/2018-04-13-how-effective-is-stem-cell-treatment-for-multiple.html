The question is, **How effective is stem cell treatment for multiple
sclerosis?**

The actual answer is, **we don't know**. Currently, stem cell treatment
is experimental, and thus carries a great deal of risk.

As you've seen in some of the other answers here, there is anecdotal
evidence that treatment with adult stem cells may be effective. However,
it is important to note that this treatment is bleeding-edge and simply
hasn't been proven yet. We haven't even figured out *if* it is
effective; we're still years away from determining *how* effective it
might be.

I love this statement from the National MS Society (emphasis mine)
regarding the current state of stem cell therapy:

> *Many types of stem cells are being explored for their potential
> benefits for treating multiple sclerosis.* ***Only when the results of
> these and subsequent clinical trials are available will it be possible
> to determine what the optimal cells, delivery methods, safety and
> actual effectiveness of these current experimental therapies might be
> for people with MS.***
>
> *Although cell based therapy has generated a great deal of interest
> and holds promise, the field is in its infancy and much more research
> is needed before cell based therapies become a MS treatment option.*
