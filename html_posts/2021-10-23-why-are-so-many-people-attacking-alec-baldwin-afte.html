There is no doubt that the armorer screwed up. None. And I have no doubt
that the armorer, while not criminally liable, will face a civil suit
from the estate of the deceased, and of course will never work in
Hollywood ever again (or anywhere else where gun safety is involved).

That said, there are basic rules of gun safety that *even actors* can
follow. *Even while they are acting*, they can literally still follow
the basic gun safety rules. It doesn't take any more effort to follow
the rules and still act or do literally anything else in your life.
People who carry weapons all the time know this.

And if Mr. Baldwin had bothered to take *JUST ONE* NRA gun safety
course, a few hours out of one of his days, then a decorated
cinematographer would be alive today.

They call these the BIG 4 because they are important. So important that
you can learn them one time, use them for life, and accidents like this
would never happen.

1.  Treat every single gun as if it was loaded. Every. Single. One. This
    includes prop guns.
2.  Keep your finger off of the trigger until you are ready to fire.
3.  Never point a gun at anything or anyone you are not willing to
    destroy or kill.
4.  Understand your target and what is behind your target.

While Mr. Baldwin will escape criminal liability for this tragic
accident, he should rightly be sued by the victim's family for wrongful
death, along with the armorer, because he failed to take basic care with
a firearm. "I didn't know the gun was loaded" has never been an excuse,
ever. It doesn't matter if you say it like that, or say it like "This
gun was supposed to be a prop gun, cleared by our professional armorer,
and was not supposed to contain a live round," it still means "I didn't
know the gun was loaded."
