**What is the best diet for someone suffering from multiple sclerosis?**

If you're interested in trying an MS-specific diet, I would highly
recommend the [[Wahls
protocol](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cd9bfb&url=https://terrywahls.com/about-the-wahls-protocol/){.external_link

you review the [[Swank MS
Diet](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8599e1&url=http://www.swankmsdiet.org/the-diet/){.external_link

Dr. Wahls' diet uses paleo principles and what she learned from
supplementation rolled into a diet. Her story is amazing, and it's
really quite interesting to see how she basically found what you can
consider, for her, to be a functional cure for her MS. To that end,
while I won't go so far to say that it will cure your MS (or even be a
functional cure like hers), I will tell you that if you're looking for a
diet which has the best chance at improving your health and helping to
alleviate the symptoms of MS, this is the one I recommend. I stumbled on
much of what Dr. Wahls captured in her diet on my own, through my own
research and supplementation, but her work is definitely amazing (side
note: [[she's also on
Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Terry-Wahls-MD)]{.qlink_container}).

The Swank MS Diet operates on the theory that it is red meats and
saturated fats that contribute the most to MS symptoms. To that end, on
the diet, there is no red meat at all for the first year. Saturated fats
are limited to 15 grams per day. Fruits and vegetables are allowed in
any amount, and nuts and seeds are recommended as sources of good fats.
White meat poultry and white fish become the primary sources of protein.
This is another good, solid diet which will likely get you going in the
right direction.

I tend to think more naturally and holistically than fractionally, so I
prefer something more akin to Paleo (which I have done with great
success) when choosing a diet. Perhaps that's why I lean more towards
Wahls than Swank, but I put them both out there. They're both excellent
diets and many people have had great success with them.

Finally, and I can't stress this enough, *before you start, stop, or
change anything you're eating, talk to your neurologist*. If you want to
try one of these diets, let your neurologist know you're doing it. Also
(and it almost goes without saying, but I'll say it anyway), ***don't
stop, start, or change your MS medications AT ALL without the advice and
consent of your neurologist.*** These diets should not be considered a
replacement for any of the MS therapy drugs. They should be considered
*supplements* to your traditional MS therapy. Again, these diets, along
with regular exercise and your approved MS therapy drugs, offer you the
*best chance* of minimized MS symptoms and a healthy, improved
lifestyle, while living with MS. Everyone is different, and everyone who
has MS will experience it differently. In other words, your mileage may
vary. This may work well for you; it may not work quite as strikingly
for you as it does for others. But doing all these things together
(diet, exercise, and your MS drug) offers you the best chance for
success.
