**If Trump or any President was to issue a pardon when leaving the White
House, and the person who they selected was a mass murderer, terrorist
or a sex offender against kids, and was a danger to the public, would
the authorities refuse?**

No. Considering that the authorities in question (the Federal Bureau of
Prisons) works directly for the President, it's unlikely they would
refuse a direct order from their boss.

The President's pardon power is absolute. It's in the Constitution. It
doesn't matter who he pardons, or what that person did. If he issues a
pardon, that person's sentence is over, and he is released from
incarceration *poste haste*. It doesn't matter how much of a continuing
danger that person is to society.
