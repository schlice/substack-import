**Are all those rumors about Donald Trump's mental illness "fake
news"?**

Of course they are. Any health-related information is protected, and is
illegal to reveal.

Additionally, mental illness doesn't come on like you've caught a cold.
Mental processes slowly deteriorate over time. Everyone gets a little
bit mentally slow as they get older, and we know Trump is not a young
man.

But mental illness such that the President cannot discharge his duties
any further?

Yep, fake news.
