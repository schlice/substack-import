Helium is a completely nonrenewable resource.

Since helium is very rare in the atmosphere (0.00052% by volume), it is
generally removed from underneath the Earth\'s crust. Helium is formed
in two ways: nuclear fusion and radioactive decay. The largest
percentage of helium on Earth is formed by radioactive decay of minerals
within the Earth\'s lithosphere, and since helium is trapped by the same
conditions that trap natural gas within the lithosphere, the greatest
concentrations of helium on the planet are found within natural gas.
This is where most of the helium is derived, through a low-heat
separation process called fractional distillation.

It is not logical to assume that once natural gas runs out that helium
would run out as well, since natural gas is formed by decay of organic
matter. Radioactive material is also finite, as radioactive material
does have a half life, but the half-life of uranium-238 is 4.47 billion
years.

So while the production of helium through radioactive decay is
technically not a sustainable process, the process of radioactive decay
is so slow that its depletion is outside the scope of a discussion of
sustainability. Therefore, in practical terms, you can consider helium
to be **not sustainable,** even though its production is outside of the
scope of discussions regarding sustainability.
