<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Helium is a completely nonrenewable resource.<br><br>Since helium is very rare in the atmosphere (0.00052% by volume), it is<br>generally removed from underneath the Earth\'s crust. Helium is formed<br>in two ways: nuclear fusion and radioactive decay. The largest<br>percentage of helium on Earth is formed by radioactive decay of minerals<br>within the Earth\'s lithosphere, and since helium is trapped by the same<br>conditions that trap natural gas within the lithosphere, the greatest<br>concentrations of helium on the planet are found within natural gas.<br>This is where most of the helium is derived, through a low-heat<br>separation process called fractional distillation.<br><br>It is not logical to assume that once natural gas runs out that helium<br>would run out as well, since natural gas is formed by decay of organic<br>matter. Radioactive material is also finite, as radioactive material<br>does have a half life, but the half-life of uranium-238 is 4.47 billion<br>years.<br><br>So while the production of helium through radioactive decay is<br>technically not a sustainable process, the process of radioactive decay<br>is so slow that its depletion is outside the scope of a discussion of<br>sustainability. Therefore, in practical terms, you can consider helium<br>to be not sustainable, even though its production is outside of the<br>scope of discussions regarding sustainability.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
