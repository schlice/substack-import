**Content:** [First of all, if you are truly in love, then nothing
should stand in your way, not even MS.\
\
Your doctor told you how it \"could\" be, but in fact, no one knows how
it will be. MS is a very individual disease, and everyone who gets it
will experience it differently. They will have different symptoms (out
of a range of symptoms), different rates of relapse, and different
levels of disability. Some of us have been blessed with this disease and
have little disease activity, some of us get this disease and it runs
rampant.\
\
What I can tell you is that the vast majority of people with MS will go
on to have normal lifespans and (mostly) normal lives. We do have to
manage our disease, actively. You have to make sure you continue to
exercise, you have to make sure to keep your muscles strong, and you
have to keep your mind active. You have to take one of the approved MS
therapy drugs, because that is the only proven way to slow the course of
the disease and to limit its effects. Doing these two things gives you
the best chance of living a full life with MS.\
\
Your doctor told you how it \"could\" be, which I\'m certain was pretty
scary. He probably said that your boyfriend/fiance√© could end up walking
with a cane, be confined to a wheelchair, or end up completely bedridden
because of MS. This is true, but it is a small percentage of people. As
I mentioned, the vast majority of people will go on to live mostly
normal lives, having to make some lifestyle changes, and taking
medications.\
\
Don\'t let the fact that he has MS ruin your life together. He\'s still
the same person you fell in love with. He just has a few new struggles
to deal with. You can help him through those struggles. If you\'re not
prepared to do that for someone, then maybe you\'re not ready to be
married yet. But if you are, he will need someone to lean on, to share
his struggles with, and to reassure him and encourage him in his MS
journey. It\'s not a hard job, but his disease could get worse down the
road, and you\'d have to be a caregiver as well as a wife. You have to
be prepared to do that, but in marriage, we pledge ourselves \"for
better or worse, in sickness and in health\" so this is part of the
marriage vow.\

I hope this helps.]{.rendered_qtext}
