So when comparing the three states, Florida and Texas generally compare
pretty favorably economically, because neither of them have a state
income tax (which includes retirement money), and the states generally
compare very well when it comes to cost of living.

Florida has a few legs up in that it has a very large portion of the
state who is of retirement age (heck, Florida has an entire *city* which
is comprised of literally nothing but retirees, and it is very large),
it has more favorable weather for more of the year, and being ranked
number 5 out of 50 states for people on Medicare, it's really a
tailor-made location for retirees.

Arizona is a close second, but the income tax thing tends to hurt them,
as well as the smaller population of retirees, but some people like the
dry heat better than the moist heat. My wife and her Sj√∂gren's Disease
needs moisture, so we live in Florida.

Original question:

Why don\'t more people retire to Texas rather than Arizona and Florida?
