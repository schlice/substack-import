God will never abandon you. God will never forsake you (Hebrews 13:5).
He is always there, waiting for you (Jeremiah 29:11, Isaiah 30:18). So
if we are feeling far from Him, then it is probably an *us* issue, not a
*Him* issue.

So what are some of the reasons we can feel far from God?

- We will always feel far from God when we do not seek Him. When we
  ignore Him, when we act independently of Him, or when we do our own
  thing and expect God to support us in our own efforts, we can feel far
  from God.
- We will also feel far from God when we sin, and we don't seek
  forgiveness. If we haven't honestly repented of our sin for whatever
  reason, this can lead to God feeling as if He is far from us.
- When we don't *regularly* get in to the Word, God can feel far from
  us.
- When we allow negative thoughts and emotions to rule our minds, we
  leave Satan an opportunity to swoop in and plant the seeds of doubt in
  our minds, which separate us from God.
- When we compare our spiritual journey to others (I am so guilty of
  this), it leads us to feelings of inadequacy and discourages us in our
  own faith journey.

An honest self-examination and a commitment to prayer and regular
engagement in the Word should get you back on track.
