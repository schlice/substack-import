Rather than me trying to bumble my way through explaining this, let me
give you the answer from the [[National MS
Society](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3aaba5&url=http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Symptoms-Diagnosis/MS-Symptoms/Bladder-Dysfunction){.external_link

Nearly 80% of people with MS will have some form of bladder dysfunction.
That\'s a pretty high number, considering that the most common symptom
of MS (fatigue, or MS Lassitude) occurs in (actually) 80% of people with
the disease. So bladder dysfunction is nearly as common in MS patients
as fatigue.

Thankfully, bladder dysfunction is one of the more treatable conditions
that arises from MS, with lifestyle modifications, medications, physical
therapy, and some nerve stimulation procedures providing some benefit
for nearly everyone.
