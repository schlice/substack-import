Because the proof that convinced *me* isn't the proof that will convince
*you*.

Tell me the kind of proof you're looking for, and we can discuss it.

Some things you're simply never going to prove. If you're looking for
*physical, empirically-testable* proof that a creator God exists, you're
**never** going to find it, as God exists outside of the physical,
empirically-testable realm.

But that does not mean that there is not scientific proof that God
exists. It does mean that you can't narrow your terminology so much that
you specifically exclude the kinds of proof which prove an unseen
creator God exists.
