**In the USA how would the general public react if the federal
government passed a law that if a man or a woman committed the same
crime then they would both get the exact same time and overall
punishment for the crime committed?**

I would call it a further weakening of the judiciary.

You're not really calling for equal rights, since there is no law that
treats a man and a woman differently (except for abortion, which is a
true violation of equal rights). What you're really looking for is for
two people, who have committed the same crime, to be **sentenced** the
same. That's not the crime, that's the sentencing. What you're really
calling for is ***sentencing reform***. And the only way to accomplish
what it is you're looking for (the exact same punishment for *everyone*
for any one crime) is to call for mandatory sentencing. And I'm certain
that you mean that ***any two people*** committing the same crime, not
just a man and a woman as the two people. What about two women? Or two
men? If you prescribe mandatory sentences for crimes committed by a man
vs a woman, you must also prescribe mandatory sentences for *everyone*,
or you violate the 5th, 6th, 8th, and 14th Amendments.

**Mandatory sentencing takes away the ability of the judiciary to be
fully effective.**

The reason we have a justice system is that in the United States,
everyone is entitled to a full trial and a vigorous defense. Everyone
can have extenuating circumstances which may influence their sentencing.
Note that sentencing is a distinct and wholly separate phase of trial
which happens after conviction. Sentencing is the phase in which
extenuating circumstances can be examined. We know you did it, now *why*
did you do it. The state of mind of the defendant at the time is taken
into consideration, and sentencing leniency may be provided. The judge
has a range of sentences which may be handed down, and the sentence,
ideally, fits the exact circumstances of that crime committed by that
person.

When mandatory sentences are prescribed for certain crimes, the entire
sentencing phase of the trial is eliminated. There is no opportunity for
leniency. There is no opportunity for extenuating circumstances to be
introduced. You did it, we proved it, you were found guilty, you get the
mandatory punishment, just like everyone else.

Mandatory sentences work in certain circumstances, such as repeat
offenders (the "three-strike rule," as an example). But replacing
judge's discretion and sentencing guidelines with mandatory sentencing
**all the time** is a travesty of justice.
