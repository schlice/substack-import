**With a plethora of testimonies acknowledging Quid Pro Quo published to
the public, how will the Republicans defend Trump against the
impeachment?**

READ THE TRANSCRIPT. THINK FOR YOURSELF.

What you're hearing from these "testimonies" are, first of all, not all
first-hand knowledge of the phone call and its circumstances. Second,
they are peoples' opinions about what they think they know.

There was no quid pro quo in the phone call. The Ukrainians themselves
agree that there was no quid pro quo, and they'd love to get Trump out
of office so that someone else more favorable to them would help them
with their Russia problem.

No matter how anyone spins it, the transcript is the transcript, and
there was no quid pro quo in the transcript.

In fact, in his testimony, former Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker pushed back
on the claim that Trump was withholding meeting wit the Ukrainians until
they investigated Biden and his son, and he also denied that Trump was
seeking "dirt" on Biden. These "testimonies" are as damaging for
Democrats as Democrats think they are damaging for the President.
