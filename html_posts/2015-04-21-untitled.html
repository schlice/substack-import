**Content:** [*Running round in military gear pointing weapons at
unarmed civilians and reporters, confiscating recording devices etc*\
This is called \"riot control\". And as we learned with Michael Brown,
\"unarmed\" does not equate to \"not dangerous.\"\
\
*The concept thes cops either ignored or were never taught is called
escalation*\
The cops do not escalate. The people escalated. Notice that the cops
didn\'t start the riots. They responded.\
\
*\[A\]nd the military are trained not to aim at people till necessary.*\
Really? We have special \"aiming\" training in the military? Must\'ve
missed that class\...\
\
You are spending a lot of time equating the police to the military. They
may look similar, but they are different. Different missions, different
bosses, different customers, etc. False equivalency.]{.rendered_qtext}
