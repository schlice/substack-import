**If Trump\'s tweets aren\'t sufficient evidence to prove he\'s unfit to
serve as president, what would be?**

What makes someone "unfit?"

The Constitution says that in order to be fit to be President, you have
to be a natural born citizen and be at least 35 years old, and you must
have resided in the United States for at least 14 years. So according to
the Constitution, he is fit to be President.

Beyond what the Constitution says, other levels of "fitness" required
include being physically able to execute the duties of the office. To
date, Trump is still alive, upright and breathing. He has not lost his
faculties to such an extent that his Cabinet would conclude that he is
no longer sane, so he is still able to continue as President under the
requirements of the 25th Amendment.

So beyond all of that, what else makes someone fit or unfit to be
President? Since there are no laws or regulations, **it's really down to
personal opinion as to what constitutes "fitness" to serve as
President.**

Therefore, if you feel the President is not fit to serve, don't re-elect
him.
