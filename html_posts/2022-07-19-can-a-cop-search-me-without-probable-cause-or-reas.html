The short answer to the question is no.

The longer answer is no, but it's hard to know whether or not they have
probable cause or reasonable suspicion because they don't have to tell
you.

In the landmark case *Terry v. Ohio*, the court allowed the police to do
a cursory pat-down of a person in order to check for weapons to ensure
their own safety while they continued asking questions. This cursory
pat-down is called a *Terry* *stop*, and it only requires reasonable
suspicion that a crime was committed or is going to be committed. It
also only permits a quick pat-down for weapons, not a complete search.

If the police have probable cause to arrest you, they can do a complete
search.

But here's the catch: **they are under no obligation to tell you why
they have reasonable suspicion or probable cause.**

Once you're arrested and you go to your arraignment hearing, the judge
asks the police officer to detail his or her reasonable suspicion and/or
probable cause. *That is where the police officer must articulate the
reasonable suspicion and/or probable cause*. They don't have to tell
you, they only have to tell the judge. That information will be in the
arrest report, but the judge can question the officer on it if he or she
chooses.

If the officer did not have reasonable suspicion to conduct a *Terry*
stop, anything found during that stop is suppressed and can't be used as
evidence. If the officer did not have probable cause to effect an
arrest, the arrest is suppressed and you are released from custody. You
and your lawyer will work through all of those details.

So if you're in a situation where the police may have unlawfully
searched you, make sure you have a good criminal defense attorney and
tell him or her everything.
