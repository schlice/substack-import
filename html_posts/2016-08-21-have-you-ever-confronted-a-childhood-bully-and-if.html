I beat him senseless. And it was the worst experience of my life.

We were in Junior High school, so I was probably 13 or 14 at the time. I
can remember exactly where I was in the school, during what you would
call a "passing period" today. He had been bullying me (verbal
harassment) non stop, daily, for months. I guess it was just bottled up
for too long, and I lost it. He said something that I don\'t remember
from right behind me (something about his supposed sexual exploits with
my mother, I think), and I snapped. My vision clouded over. I threw my
books down. I spun around, grabbed him around the neck with my arm, and
punched him in the face. A lot. I also think I ran him into a locker.

I don\'t remember much after that. He was on the ground, very bloody,
but most of it was probably from his lips getting cut up on his braces.
It\'s all pretty hazy after that, but the next thing I remember is being
seated in the Dean\'s office. I looked down at my hands, and they were
still balled into fists. I tried to open them, but I couldn\'t. I forced
myself to open them, and found it very difficult to do so, and when they
finally opened, I saw nail cuts on my palms from my own nails. I was
traumatized and inconsolable for quite some time.

It was an absolutely terrible experience.
