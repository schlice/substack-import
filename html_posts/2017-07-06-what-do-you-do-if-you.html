Did she call the police? Have you been arrested? If so, *get a lawyer.*

Is she just telling anyone and everyone that you raped her? Well, she
has a free speech right. You can't really stop her from telling "her
side" of the story.

That is, unless her side of the story begins to cost you monetarily.
Once it does, you will have to get a lawyer and sue her for slander and
defamation of character. Hopefully it never comes to that.
