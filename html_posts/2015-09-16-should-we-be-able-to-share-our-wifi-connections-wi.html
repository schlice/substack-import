answer. some WiFi routers give you the option of creating a \"Guest\"
network which is isolated from your home network (for the techies, it
does this using VLANs). This will protect your home systems from
intrusion by anyone on the guest network, but it won\'t protect you from
legal liability should someone on your guest network do something
illegal. The IP address will still be the one for your ISP\'s access
point. You\'re opening yourself up to some legal issues that you\'re
best served by avoiding.\
\
Use the guest network for anyone who comes to your house and wants to
connect. That way, you still have positive control over who is using
your network and why, and their dirty, infected machines won\'t infect
the rest of your network (I\'m not saying everyone\'s systems that
connect to your network are infected, but from a security standpoint,
you can only control your own systems, so you should treat all outside
systems that way). As for your neighbors, let them buy their own
Internet service.]{.rendered_qtext}
