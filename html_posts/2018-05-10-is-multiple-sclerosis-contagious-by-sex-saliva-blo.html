**Is multiple sclerosis contagious by sex /saliva /blood?**

No, multiple sclerosis is not contagious. You can't "catch" MS.

There are several factors which go into determining your risk for MS.
Age, sex, ethnicity, geography of birth, prevalence in your first-degree
relatives, and exposure to an as-of-yet unidentified infectious trigger
are all factors which can increase your risk of developing MS.

Exposure to a person with MS is **not** one of them.

We're so convinced that MS is not contagious, that eleven years ago, the
Red Cross lifted its ban on MS patients donating blood.

[[People with MS can now give blood at the Red
Cross](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=fc89ac&url=https://secure.nationalmssociety.org/site/SPageServer/%253Bjsessionid%3DDF09D5EA8D68BF2CA036C48F00BFB260.app354a?pagename%3DNTH_programs_giveblood){.external_link
