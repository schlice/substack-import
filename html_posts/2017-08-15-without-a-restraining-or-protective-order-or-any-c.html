You asked this question oddly. Let me break it down and answer it piece
by piece:

> *\[H\]ow can I be arrested for trespassing, which I was*

Simple. If you are not listed on the deed as an owner of the property,
and the owner of the property asks you to leave, and you don't, you are
*de facto* trespassing. This may not have been the case, but you didn't
supply any details, so we're just guessing. But any time you are on
private property (which includes private property open to the public,
like restaurants) and the property owner tells you to leave, then that
"open to the public" thing no longer applies to you, as you are present
in that property at the pleasure of the property owner. If they ask you
to leave, you must leave. Continued presence constitutes trespassing.

> *Without a restraining or protective order or any court order put on
> me or my house*

These things are not required in order to support a charge of
trespassing. If there was a restraining order or protective order issued
against you, violating the restraining order would be a violation of a
court order, not trespassing.

> *\[D\]o I have the right to sue the police for doing so*

If the police were carrying out their duty, which is to enforce the law,
and they found probable cause to presume that you were, in fact,
trespassing, they have the authority to arrest you and charge you with
trespassing. Suing the police, while possible, is not likely to get you
far, so long as the officers were doing their jobs.

If they arrested you with no cause and with no collected evidence and
you were subsequently released because there was no evidence to support
a charge of trespassing, you can then sue the police (with the help of
your lawyer) for *false arrest,* or whatever the charge is called in
your jurisdiction. Beyond that, suing the police for doing their jobs,
while possible, is not likely to benefit you in any way.
