Whoever or whatever is referred to as "God," this being
***necessarily*** must be uncreated.

Why?

This being must be uncreated because if it is created, you can
continually ask the question "who created it" *ad infinitum*. This is
what we call the "infinite regress" and it is a problem when you have no
**first cause**.

The first cause is necessarily uncaused. The great Uncaused Cause.
Ultimately, that is the being who created us, even if by proxy, by
creating our creator.
