**What is the legal action that Nancy Pelosi and the House can take now
that the White House has confirmed that Trump will take executive action
to build the wall?**

The House can sue the Trump Administration for spending money without
Congressional approval. As Matthew Bohrer [[already
explained](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-legal-action-that-Nancy-Pelosi-and-the-House-can-take-now-that-the-White-House-has-confirmed-that-Trump-will-take-executive-action-to-build-the-wall/answer/Matthew-Bohrer)]{.qlink_container},
Republicans sued the Obama Administration over ACA funding.

However, this lawsuit would be different. Trump does have various
methods by which he could *legally* use DoD funding to build a fence,
following a declaration of national emergency. If the court finds that
these methods are, in fact, lawful (and don't violate the Constitution
in and of themselves), then the decision to utilize them would be
political questions, not legal ones. I'd think you would find the courts
failing to render a decision because it would be primarily a political
question, not a legal one.

In that case, the House would be left with impeaching the President over
an abuse of power, abusing the national emergency system to bypass
Article I of the Constitution. The Senate still won't remove him from
office over that, as they would equivocate about whether or not the lack
of funding actually constituted a national emergency. They would
probably defer to the President's judgement over that, and still
wouldn't see it as something which would prevent the President from
completing his term in office.
