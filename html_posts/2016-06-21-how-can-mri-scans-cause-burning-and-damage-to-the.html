It seems that most burn injuries caused by MRIs can be isolated to the
following causes:

- Faulty MRI equipment
- Conductive external or internal implants
- Old tattoos which contained metallic ions in the dye
- Body parts in direct contact with the transmitting coils
- Conducting objects in the RF field causing a concentration of the RF
  energy
- Microfiber clothing which contains metallic ions (such as silver
  thread in a microfiber shirt)

Here are the guidelines to perform an appropriate and safe MRI. If these
do not happen when you go to get your MRI, tell the MR tech immediately.
If they refuse to fix it, stop the scan and inform your doctor.

1.  The patient should change into a gown or other appropriate attire
    that does not contain metallic material.
2.  Prepare the patient for the MR procedure by ensuring that there are
    no unnecessary metallic objects contacting the patient's skin (e.g.,
    drug delivery patches with metallic components, jewelry, necklaces,
    bracelets, key chains, etc.).
3.  Prepare the patient for the MR procedure by using insulation
    material (i.e. appropriate padding) to prevent skin-to-skin contact
    points and the formation of "closed-loops" from touching body parts.
4.  Insulating material (minimum recommended thickness, 1-cm) should be
    placed between the patient's skin and transmit RF coil that is used
    for the MR procedure (alternatively, the transmit RF coil itself
    should be padded). There should be no direct contact between the
    patient's skin and the transmit RF body coil of the MR system. This
    may be accomplished by having the patient place his/her arms over
    his/her head or by using elbow pads or foam padding between the
    patient's tissue and the transmit RF body coil of the MR system.
    This is especially important for MR examinations that use the
    transmit RF body coil or other large RF coils for transmission of RF
    energy.
5.  Use only electrically conductive devices, equipment, accessories
    (e.g., ECG leads, electrodes, etc.), and materials that have been
    thoroughly tested and determined to be safe or otherwise acceptable
    for MR procedures.
6.  Carefully follow specific MR safety or MR conditional criteria and
    recommendations for implants and devices made from
    electrically-conductive materials (e.g., bone fusion stimulators,
    neurostimulation systems, cardiac pacemakers, cochlear implants,
    intracranial pressure monitoring catheters, etc.).
7.  Before using electrical equipment, check the integrity of the
    insulation and/or housing of all components including surface RF
    coils, monitoring leads, cables, and wires. Preventive maintenance
    should be practiced routinely for such equipment.
8.  Remove all non-essential electrically conductive materials from the
    MR system prior to the MR procedure (i.e. unused surface RF coils,
    ECG leads, EEG leads, cables, wires, etc.).
9.  Keep electrically conductive materials that must remain in the MR
    system from directly contacting the patient by placing thermal
    and/or electrical insulation between the conductive material and the
    patient.
10. Keep electrically conductive materials that must remain within the
    transmit body RF coil or other transmit RF coil of the MR system
    from forming conductive loops. Note: The patient's tissue is
    conductive and, therefore, may be involved in the formation of a
    conductive loop, which can be circular, U-shaped, or S-shaped.
11. Position electrically conductive materials to prevent "cross
    points". A cross point is the point where a cable crosses another
    cable, where a cable loops across itself, or where a cable touches
    either the patient or sides of the transmit RF coil more than once.
    Even the close proximity of conductive materials with each other
    should be avoided because cables and RF coils can
    capacitively-couple (without any contact or crossover) when placed
    close together.
12. Position electrically conductive materials (e.g., cables, wires,
    etc.) to exit down the *center of the MR system*, *not* along the
    side of the MR system or close to the transmit RF body coil or other
    transmit RF coil.
13. Do not position electrically conductive materials across an external
    metallic prosthesis (e.g., external fixation device, cervical
    fixation device, etc.) or similar device that is in direct contact
    with the patient.
14. Allow only properly trained individuals to operate devices (e.g.,
    monitoring equipment) in the MR environment.
15. Follow all manufacturer instructions for the proper operation and
    maintenance of physiologic monitoring or other similar electronic
    equipment intended for use during MR procedures.
16. Electrical devices that do not appear to be operating properly
    during the MR procedure should be removed from the patient
    immediately.
17. Closely monitor the patient during the MR procedure. If the patient
    reports sensations of heating or other unusual sensation,
    discontinue the MR procedure immediately and perform a thorough
    assessment of the situation.[\[2\]](#gOGjl){#cite-gOGjl
