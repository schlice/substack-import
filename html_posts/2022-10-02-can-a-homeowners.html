The short answer is no, but it's a qualified no. What they *can* do is
sell your house out from under you, remove the panels themselves, and
then resell the house to someone else. So if that counts as no, then so
be it.

The rules about solar panels vary by state. Some states have no laws at
all regarding HOAs and solar panels, and the HOA can flat-out restrict
all solar panels if they choose. Some states tell HOAs that they must
allow solar panels, but they can regulate where on the property they can
be installed (so if you wanted to install a separate solar array instead
of a rooftop array, they could restrict that). Finally, some states
allow for agreements between homeowners guaranteeing a minimum amount of
sunlight for any one property, thus preserving the right to solar for
the future.

Regardless of the state rules, if your HOA can restrict either the
complete installation or the location of the panels, the way an HOA
enforces its covenants is through fines. So if you break the rules (like
by installing solar panels in a place they tell you not to), the HOA can
fine you. If you refuse to pay the fines, the HOA can place a lien on
your house for the amount owed, and when that amount exceeds certain
state-defined levels, the HOA can foreclose on that lien, sell your
house out from under you, remove the panels themselves, and then resell
the house.

**TL;DR:** In most cases, the HOA cannot directly force you to remove
the panels. But they can take your house and then take the panels off
themselves.
