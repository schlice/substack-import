**What happens if you can\'t afford to miss work for jury duty because
you're living check to check?**

Most jurisdictions allow for deferrals and excusals from jury duty.

You usually can't be excused from jury duty because of your employment
status. You may be able to be *deferred* from a particular reporting day
because of work requirements, but generally not *excused* completely.

If you have a financial hardship that prevents you from serving,
deferring your duty may give you the opportunity to pick a date in the
future that you can serve, and then requesting vacation from your work.

Most jurisdictions use the "one day, one trial" system whereby if you
are not selected for trial, your jury duty is over. Most trials don't
last longer than three days.

There are also employment laws which protect employees from being fired
because they were summoned to jury duty, but I can understand how
employers may abuse "at will" employment law to skirt that particular
rule.

I know that it sucks. I know that it is a tremendous hardship to go to
jury duty.

But ask yourself this question: ***if you were on the other side of the
courtroom, behind the defendant's table instead of in the jury box,
would you want someone to try to get themselves out of your jury?***
