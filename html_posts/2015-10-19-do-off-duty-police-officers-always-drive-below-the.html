**Content:** [No one can speak for every police officer. But most guys I
know want to become anonymous when they go off duty. It\'s tiring having
video cameras pointed at you all day, knowing you work in the only
profession in the world (besides \"being a celebrity,\" if you can call
that a profession) where you are constantly being recorded wherever you
go. Every time you get out of your car, there is at least one person
with a cell phone camera recording you, hoping you slip up so they can
get their 15 minutes of YouTube fame.\
\
So most guys I know will change out of their uniforms, slip into their
private cars, put on some music, and cruise home.\
\
Below the speed limit.\
\
Because they\'ve attracted enough attention all day. Once they\'re done
with work, they want to become invisible.]{.rendered_qtext}
