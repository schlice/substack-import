**No. Science cannot prove the existence of God.** But let's not just
leave it there, because there are billions of believers in God around
the world. Are they all delusional? Do they all believe something which
has *no proof?*

First, we must identify what we will accept as "proof." When most people
demand "scientific proof," this normally refers to **data** you can see,
hear, taste, touch, or smell---things that directly confirm or undermine
a hypothesis. And in the context of science, such evidence has led to
remarkable results. Just look at today's advancements in technology and
medicine.

However, scientific evidence isn't the *only* type of evidence. Many
truths that exist cannot be proven through physical evidence. For
instance, we don't have physical evidence that a sunset is beautiful or
that the Nazis were evil. Of course, we understand these statements to
be true, but not because we have found physical evidence to support
them.

The same holds true for the existence of God. Whether you believe God
exists or not, He is, by definition, *immaterial* and *transcendent*. He
is *immaterial* because He is not composed of physical matter, not made
of material stuff like you and me (it is necessary for Him to be
immaterial because He created matter, so He must be outside of it). And
God is *transcendent* because He exists beyond space and time (it is
necessary to exist beyond space and time in order to create them). Thus,
when we're searching for God, we do not expect to find direct, physical,
scientific evidence for His existence within space and time. This fact
is important: **it is not just that we have not yet found such evidence
even though it may exist, it is that such evidence is** ***impossible*,
even in principle.** We are not going to find one of God's hairs, or
discover His footprint, or run a scientific experiment to see if He
exists.

Does that mean it is impossible to demonstrate that God exists? No. It
simply means that *science is not the right means,* just as a metal
detector is not the right tool to find a plastic cup.

The right tools, or the right proofs, are "logical" proofs, which are
contained in the discipline called *philosophy.* Philosophy is concerned
with life's most important issues, from morality to meaning to God.
Philosophy allows us to probe realities that **can't be detected**
through our senses; thus, philosophy provides an excellent method to
explore evidence for the existence of God.

Let's not forget, philosophy is not divorced from science, as if you can
rely on science alone, and philosophy is just pseudo-babble for PhDs to
discuss while smoking pipes in dimly-lit rooms. Philosophy is the
*foundation* of science. Science is dependent on philosophy. In fact,
***science is a slave to philosophy.*** Bad philosophy results in bad
science, and good science requires good philosophy. Why? Because:

1.  **Science cannot be done without philosophy.** Philosophical
    assumptions are utilized in the search for causes, and, therefore,
    cannot be the result of them. For example, scientists assume (by
    faith) that reason and the scientific method allow us to accurately
    understand the world around us. That cannot be proven by science
    itself. You can't prove the tools of science---the laws of logic,
    the Law of Causality, the Principle of Uniformity, or the
    reliability of observation---by running some kind of experiment. You
    have to assume those things are true in order to do the experiment!
    So science is built on philosophy. Unfortunately, many so-called
    scientists are very poor philosophers.
2.  **Philosophical assumptions can dramatically impact scientific
    conclusions**. If a scientist assumes beforehand that only natural
    causes are possible, then probably no amount of evidence will
    convince him that intelligence created the first one-celled amoeba
    or any other designed entity. When Darwinists presuppose that
    intelligent causes are impossible, then natural laws are the only
    game in town. Likewise, if a creationist rules out natural causes
    beforehand (and we don't know of any who do), then he also risks
    missing the right answer. But a scientist who is open-minded to both
    natural and intelligent causes can follow the evidence wherever it
    leads.
3.  **Science doesn't really say anything---scientists do.** Data are
    always interpreted by scientists. When those scientists let their
    personal preferences or unproven philosophical assumptions dictate
    their interpretation of the evidence, they do exactly what they
    accuse religious people of doing---they let their ideology dictate
    their conclusions. When that's the case, their conclusions should be
    questioned, because they may be nothing more than philosophical
    presuppositions passed off as scientific facts.

Philosophy typically offers evidence in the form of *arguments*. In
fact, thinkers over the years have identified no fewer than twenty
arguments for God, arguments that range from the clear and simple to the
extremely complex. Some of these arguments appeal to the universe or
history, others to the existence of reason and beauty.

We can approach the God question from many angles, and there is no one
best way. But I think there is one argument that is not only clear and
convincing, but easy enough to understand.

Now, I know that sometimes, terms like "arguments" or "evidence" bother
people. If they bother you, you might instead consider these arguments
as "clues" that converge and point to a common conclusion, much the way
road signs guide you to a specific destination. A sign doesn't prove
that the destination exists, but it does point the way. These arguments
are signposts to God. So, let us look at one signpost that in my
opinion, presents perhaps the simplest yet most powerful argument for
God's existence.

The Kalam argument dates back to the Middle Ages but has been made
popular today by William Lane Craig, an evangelical Christian
philosopher. The argument is very simple; in fact, it is probably the
easiest of all the arguments to understand, having two premises and one
conclusion:

- P1: Everything which has a beginning has a cause.
- P2: The universe had a beginning.
- C1: The universe has a cause.

So let's dig in to these two premises and one conclusion:

**Premise 1:** This statement says everything that has a beginning has a
cause. It's very important that we get this right. Some atheists try to
refute this premise by responding, "But if everything that exists has a
cause, and God exists, then what caused God?" But the premise does not
claim, "Everything that *exists* has a cause." It says, "Everything that
*begins to exist* has a cause." Since God, by definition, and whether
you believe in Him or not, is eternal and never began to exist, this
first premise does not apply to Him. Therefore, the rhetorical question
"What caused God?" is like asking, "To whom is the bachelor married?" or
"What is the sound of one hand clapping?" Regardless of whether
bachelors or hands exist, these questions do not make sense. They are
literally nonsense because they confuse the meaning of terms.

Now that we have cleared away that misunderstanding, let us turn back to
the first premise. Is it true? Does everything that begins to exist have
a cause? For most people, the answer is yes; it is common sense. Almost
nobody denies it. The statement simply means that nothing just springs
into existence, randomly and without a cause. For if things did come
into being this way, then our world would be a wild spree of things
apparently popping into existence like sleight of hand magic. Only it
would be worse, since with sleight of hand you at least have a magician
who pulls rabbits out of a hat. However, in a world that violates this
first premise, rabbits would pop in and out of being even without
magicians or hats. Few sane people believe the world works this way.
Even the great atheist David Hume said, "I never asserted so absurd a
proposition as that something should arise without a cause." So, through
experience and reflection most people, even most honest atheists, agree
that everything that begins to exist has a cause.

**Premise 2:** This claim is slightly more controversial than the first
one. In fact, no less a thinker than St. Thomas Aquinas says that the
truth that the world had a beginning of its duration is only
conclusively known by faith and not by reason. Nonetheless, a host of
the greatest minds from antiquity to the present, including St.
Bonaventure in the Middle Ages and William Lane Craig today, offer
arguments that purport to defend this truth. An example of one of these
arguments, one which St. Bonaventure includes in his paradoxes of the
infinite, goes as follows: If the world has always existed, then there
would be an infinite number of past days. However, if there were an
infinite number of past days, we never would have been able to arrive at
the present day because an infinite series, by definition, cannot be
traversed. Since we have arrived at today (and today is the end date of
history), it follows that there must have been a beginning of time (a
beginning date).

Modern physics also seems to give weight to this position. Despite
cyclic cosmological models advanced by some physicists in recent years,
since the advent of the big bang theory in the twentieth century, the
scientific consensus is that the universe did have a beginning roughly
fourteen billion years ago. Alexander Vilenkin, a leading non-Christian
cosmologist, was invited to speak at a colloquium for Stephen Hawking's
seventieth birthday. There, in front of the greatest scientists in the
world, Vilenkin said, "All the evidence we have says that the universe
had a beginning." It is rare for scientists to speak with this measure
of conclusiveness, but Vilenkin stated his opinion that it is not just
that *some* of the evidence points to a beginning of the universe, or
even the *majority* of evidence, but that *all* of the evidence points
that way today.

**Conclusion**: The two premises are widely accepted today: everything
that begins to exist has a cause, and the universe began to exist. If
that is the case, then the third statement, the conclusion of the
argument, logically follows. We cannot avoid the fact that if everything
that begins to exist has a cause, and the universe began to exist, then
the universe must have had a cause.

It's important to note that the Kalam Cosmological Argument doesn't
prove that God created the universe. It only proves that the universe
must have had a cause. But that logical conclusion leads us to wonder:
if the universe had a cause, *what* is that cause? The cause certainly
could not have been anything *within* the universe or even *the universe
itself*, since things can't cause themselves to come into existence.
This idea defies logic. Thus, the cause of the universe must be
something *beyond* the universe, something beyond all matter, energy,
space, and time. In other words, it must be transcendent (beyond the
universe), it must be immaterial (beyond matter and space), it must be
eternal (beyond time), and if it has created something so massive and
complex as the universe, it must be tremendously powerful and
intelligent (the Law of Causality tells us that an effect must resemble
its cause). Well, a transcendent, immaterial, eternal, supremely
powerful, and intelligent cause of the universe---what does that sound
like to you? As Thomas Aquinas pithily puts it, "This is what most
people mean by 'God.'"

Now of course, this doesn't tell us anything about *which* God exists,
or anything about that God. It simply is a logical proof which shows
that logically-speaking, a creator God must exist.
