**Content:** []{.rendered_qtext}

I read Tim Cook\'s entire open letter. I didn\'t see anything at all in
there to suggest that Apple can\'t do what the government is asking.
They would have completely avoided all of this nonsense had they just
said it can\'t be done. They certainly did not tell the judge this,
which is much more telling than anything else. They stated that they
don\'t want to follow the order for any number of ideological reasons.
This means that it is technically feasible to do what is being asked:
loading a firmware onto a locked iPhone, or the ability to download the
entire flash image onto a VM. These are security flaws. Period. If the
ability to do this exists, it is a flaw in security of the 5C. The
government is not asking Apple to permanently cripple iOS, so this whole
talk of \"backdoors\" is disingenuous.
