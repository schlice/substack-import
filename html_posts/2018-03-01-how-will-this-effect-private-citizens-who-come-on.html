**How will this effect private citizens who come on school grounds with
a concealed weapon? Isn\'t this changing the gun free zone status for
the school?**

In order for a teacher to qualify to conceal a weapon on school grounds,
two things need to happen:

1.  The teacher needs a Concealed Weapons Permit from the local sheriff
2.  The teacher needs to be certified as a school security guard in
    order to carry a weapon in the school's gun-free zone.

This means that the teacher must go through the normal process that
every other concealed weapons permit holder goes through, but then the
teacher must take and pass all of the training required to be certified
as a security guard within the district.

This doesn't change the "gun-free zone" status of the school, as
currently only police and certified school security guards can carry
weapons on school grounds, and that won't change. We're simply allowing
teachers to become "volunteer" security guards.

Likely, this will start with teachers who already possess concealed
weapons permits taking school security guard training and becoming
certified school security guards. Then they would be permitted to take
their concealed weapons onto school property.
