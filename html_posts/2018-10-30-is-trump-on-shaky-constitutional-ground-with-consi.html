**Is Trump on shaky constitutional ground with considering to interpret
the 14th Amendment to allow him to end giving citizenship to illegal
aliens children born in the US?**

There are cogent arguments on both sides as to whether or not a
Constitutional amendment is actually needed.

Looking at the text of the 14th Amendment, it says:

> All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to
> the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the
> State wherein they reside.

The sticking point here is the phrase "and subject to the jurisdiction
thereof." Illegal immigrants are not subject to the jurisdiction of the
United States; they are subject to the jurisdiction of their home
country. That seems like a valid Constitutional argument, certainly not
"shaky" ground.

Additionally, the 14th Amendment was never intended to grant citizenship
to the children of illegal immigrants. For context, we return, as the
Supreme Court does, to the words of the original authors of the
Amendment in question. Senator Jacob Howard worked closely with Abraham
Lincoln in drafting and passing the 13th Amendment (which abolished
slavery). He also served on the Senate Joint Committee on
Reconstruction, which drafted the 14th Amendment. In 1866, Senator
Howard clearly spelled out the intent of the 14th Amendment by writing
(emphasis mine):

> Every person born within the limits of the United States, and subject
> to their jurisdiction, is by virtue of natural law and national law a
> citizen of the United States. **This will not, of course, include
> persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who
> belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers accredited
> to the Government of the United States**, but will include every other
> class of persons. It settles the great question of citizenship and
> removes all doubt as to what persons are or are not citizens of the
> United States. This has long been a great desideratum in the
> jurisprudence and legislation of this country.

Clearly, from the plain wording of the writers of the 14th Amendment, it
was never intended to grant citizenship to children of illegals. Doesn't
seem very "shaky" to me.

In actuality, [[according to Ilya Shapiro of the CATO
Institute](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0372f5&url=https://www.cato.org/blog/birthright-citizenship-constitutionally-required){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="cato.org"}]{.qlink_container}, that phrase was originally
written to exclude the children of Native American tribes from American
citizenship, since those children were subject to the jurisdiction of
Native American tribal government, and were citizens of their tribe, not
of the United States. The amendment was also written to guarantee the
citizenship of freed slaves and their children, in opposition to the
*Dred Scott* ruling.

Trump knows that if he does this as an EO, it will immediately be
challenged in one of the circuits (it's always a safe bet to bet on the
9th Circus to challenge Trump's EOs), and it will end up at the Supreme
Court.

Which is exactly what Trump wants.

Even if Congress passed a law banning birthright citizenship, it would
still be challenged. Regardless, it's going to end up with SCOTUS one
way or another.
