**Content:** [I\'m sorry, but the other posters here are incorrect.\
\
The RFRA as has been interpreted in Indiana (which has been on the books
since the 90\'s) only allows for businesses to be granted religious
exemptions from **government programs**.\
\
It says nothing about **individual actions.**\
\
The original RFRA was in relation to Native Americans and peyote. Native
Americans claimed a religious exemption because of peyote in their
religious practices, and the RFRA was born, passed by a Democratic
Congress and signed into law by Bill Clinton.\
\
It was used most recently by Hobby Lobby, claiming a religious exemption
to the Affordable Care Act. And the exemption was granted, and it was
upheld by the Supreme Court.\
\
Note that the LGBT cases had nothing to do with RFRA, and any religious
exemption attempted to be claimed by individual businesses attempting to
not serve the LGBT community failed. Those businesses were legally
compelled to serve gays, or face fines. The last business that tried to
deny service to gays was run out of business.\
\
(EDIT) It appears that people are confused because there is a federal
law and Indiana passed their own law too. Yes, along with at least 26
other states, Indiana also passed their own law. It\'s pretty close to
the exact wording of the Federal law. There are some minor differences,
and LGBT supporters believe that the law will be used by businesses to
deny service to them. The differences between the two laws are very
minor wording differences, and the governor made it clear that he would
clarify the law to ensure that it would not be used by businesses to
discriminate against individuals.\
\
Again, much ado over nothing.]{.rendered_qtext}
