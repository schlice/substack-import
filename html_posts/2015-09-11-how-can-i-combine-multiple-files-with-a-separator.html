**Content:** [Start with a listing of the files in a text file. So do an
ls of the directory and dump it into a file (for our use we\'ll call it
filelist.out). Edit the file to make sure it only contains the 100
filenames.\
\
Then do a BASH script like this:\
\
for fileName in \`cat filelist.out\`\
do\
cat \$fileName \>\> combinedFile.txt\
echo \"\-\-\-\--\" \>\> combinedFile.txt\
done\
\
The double caret is necessary because that\'s what makes your new
content \"append\" to the file instead of \"overwriting\" it.\
\
This will take all 100 filenames and dump their contents into a single
file called \"combinedFile.txt\" with a separator between each file.\
\
If you wanted to include the name of the file at the beginning of each
section, at the beginning of the loop, do a echo \$fileName \>\>
combinedFile.txt\
