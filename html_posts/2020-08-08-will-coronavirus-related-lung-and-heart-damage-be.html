**Will coronavirus-related lung and heart damage be covered as a
qualifying disability under the ADA moving forward?**

A disability under ADA is defined as "a physical or mental impairment
that substantially limits one or more major life activities, a person
who has a history or record of such an impairment, or a person who is
perceived by others as having such an impairment."

If heart disease or lung disease "substantially limit one or more major
life activity" then it is covered.

What is a "major life activity?" Major life activities include, but are
not limited to, caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing,
hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending,
speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking,
communicating, and working.

If your coronavirus-related lung or heart disease "substantially limits"
one or more of those activities (or similar activities), then it is
classified as a "disability" under ADA.

If your lung disease has permanently impaired your ability to breathe
and you must be on oxygen for the rest of your life, then this is a
disability. If it just bothers you and you can't run as far as you used
to, this is not a "substantial" limitation. In short, an impairment is a
disability if it substantially limits the ability of an individual to
perform a major life activity as compared to most people in the general
population.
