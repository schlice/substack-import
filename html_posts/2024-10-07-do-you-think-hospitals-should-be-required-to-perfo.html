As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends." And in this
case, it wholly depends on how any one state classifies an "emergency
situation."

In the majority of cases, an **emergency situation** would be classified
as a pregnancy which threatens the life of the mother. At a bare
minimum, hospitals should be required to protect the life of the mother.
Every state which restricts abortions has exceptions to protect the life
of the mother. The fact that doctors are sometimes confused with how to
interpret these laws, often delaying critical care, does not negate the
fact that hospitals should be required to save the life of the mother,
using whatever means necessary to do so, including when doing so may
cause the baby to die.

But we must be very, very careful to define our terms and put sensible
guardrails around this, or ERs will become *de facto* abortion clinics
when the laws are unclear, undercutting the will of the people in those
states.

(EDIT) On Tuesday (3 May 2025). President Trump reversed the very EMTALA
policy we are discussing in this answer.

Under the Biden administration, EMTALA was reinterpreted in July 2022 to
allow taxpayer dollars to fund what were termed "emergency abortions."
This guidance not only permitted federal funding for these procedures
but also imposed penalties on health care workers and hospitals that
refused to carry them out, even when such actions conflicted with their
deeply held moral or religious convictions. The policy effectively
compelled medical professionals to act against their conscience,
creating a moral and legal dilemma for those medical professionals who
prioritize the protection of unborn life, in accordance with the
Hippocratic Oath.

After Tuesday's reversal of Biden's policy, the Trump administration
affirmed that EMTALA would continue to be utilized, but in a manner
consistent with its original intent --- to ensure emergency medical care
without mandating procedures that conflict with ethical principles or
state laws.

The policy reversal ends years of pro-abortion lawfare against pro-life
states and doctors, as well as renouncing the lie that pro-life states
deny emergency care to pregnant women.

Roger Serevino, with the Heritage Foundation, echoed those sentiments.
"Wide majorities of Americans oppose forcing doctors and hospitals to
take innocent human life," he said, "and this change goes back to
respecting conscience and the rule of law." When following its original
intent, "EMTALA requires hospitals to treat unborn children and mothers
in labor." But as Severino went on to explain, "shamelessly, abortion
radicals inverted this clearly pro-life law to unlawfully mandate
abortion nationwide, even though every state already has life of the
mother exceptions."

"To add insult to injury," Severino stressed, "the Biden order refused
to acknowledge that the law protected mothers, or even women, instead
calling them 'pregnant patients.' A stain on America's conscience is now
gone, and good riddance."
