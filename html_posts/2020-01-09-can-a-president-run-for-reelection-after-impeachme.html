**Can an unresolved impeached US president run for reelection?**

The only time a President cannot run for re-election is after the Senate
votes to remove the President from office by a supermajority of Senators
voting, **AND THEN** votes to not allow the impeached and removed
President to hold Federal office again (by simple majority).

Until that happens, the President can run for re-election and can be
re-elected.
