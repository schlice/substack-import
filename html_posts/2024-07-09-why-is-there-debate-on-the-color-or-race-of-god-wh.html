That's a great question, since God has no physical form.

You may be talking about Jesus, who took on flesh. Yes, Jesus is God,
but God is not just Jesus. God is God the Father, and God the Son, and
God the Spirit. But God the Father is not God the Son, and God the Son
is not God the Spirit, and God the Spirit is not God the Father.

Ah, the confusion of the Trinity...

Anyway, let's just assume we're talking specifically about God the Son,
aka Jesus.

**Jesus would have most likely looked like a Middle Eastern man.**

Jesus likely had dark brown to black hair, brown eyes, and olive-brown
skin, similar to most people in Judea and Egypt at the time. He may have
been around 5\'5\" (166 cm), which was the average height for men at the
time. Jesus would have had a Middle Eastern appearance and likely
appeared tough, coarse, and somewhat dirty, wearing simple clothing. The
Bible also describes Jesus as having curly hair that was woolly in
texture.

While I'm hesitant to "put Jesus in a box" by providing a picture, this
picture summarizes what Jesus ***may have*** looked like:
