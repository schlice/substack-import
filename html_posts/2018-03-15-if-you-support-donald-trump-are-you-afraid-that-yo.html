**If you support Donald Trump, are you afraid that your children will
think it is OK to act like him?**

My support (or lack thereof) for a political candidate doesn't mean I
hold that person up as an example of virtue against which my children
should mold their lives.

That's **my** job. I am required to lead a life worthy of modeling for
my children.

Politicians are just that: politicians. They are in office to run the
business of the nation, not to serve as role models for how our children
should act.

When we allow the state to parent our children, the potential exists
that our children learn virtue from politicians. I believe that
politicians are the least virtuous people in society, followed very
closely by 99% of Hollywood. And this is who you want teaching virtue to
your children?

Trump's no angel. *Access Hollywood* made sure we knew that before the
election. But we elected him anyway because we were electing a
*President*, not a moral leader.
