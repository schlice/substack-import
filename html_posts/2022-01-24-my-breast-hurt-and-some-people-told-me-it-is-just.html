Sounds like you are younger and still developing.

There are lots of reasons for breast pain, and most of them are quite
benign. In your case, it probably has much more to do with hormones than
anything else. Hormones are the number one reason women experience
breast pain. The changes in estrogen and progesterone in your body cause
reactions in breast tissue, which can sometimes make them sore.

There are some other things which can be causing your breast pain:

- An injury that you may have forgotten about, either on your breast or
  in your chest wall (like a pulled muscle)
- An unsupportive bra. While you are still growing, you need to make
  sure that you're wearing a supportive bra. Otherwise, the ligaments
  which connect the breast tissue to the chest may become overstretched
  and painful by the end of the day. Make sure your bra is the correct
  size and provides you with good support.
- Medication. If you're on certain medications, breast pain can be a
  side effect. Check with your pharmacist to see if any of the
  medications you may be on can cause breast pain as a side effect.
- A cyst. Be careful to watch for lumps in your breasts while you're
  growing. If you find any, talk to your parents right away.

The big takeaway: the vast majority of breast pain is transient (i.e.
goes away on its own) and is not dangerous. If you have breast pain that
continues, nothing makes it better (warm compress, showers, Tylenol), or
gets worse, or is accompanied by lumps in your breasts, please see your
doctor.
