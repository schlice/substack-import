**Where in the U.S. Constitution or any other legislative document does
it state that the POTUS has absolute immunity from criminal process of
any kind?**

Article II, Section 1, Clause 1:

> *The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United
> States of America.*

What this means is that the President ***is*** the Executive. In the
office of this ***one person*** has been vested ***ALL*** of the
Executive power.

Not the President and the Attorney General.\
Not the President and any US Attorney.\
Not the President and the Director of the FBI.

The President. Alone.

This means, quite literally, that any prosecutorial power that exists
anywhere in the Federal government, from the Attorney General to any US
Attorney, *flows directly from the Office of the President.*

This is a very important concept to understand. The unitary executive
theory places executive power in the hands of a single president to
provide a check against the power of the Congress, which the framers
thought to be potentially the most powerful branch of the government.

Since all prosecutorial authority flows from the office of the
President, it is impossible to indict a person who holds that office. It
is impossible to use ones own authority against oneself. Besides the
fact that it would be detrimental to the proper functioning of
government, the power to indict at a Federal level flows from the office
of the President, and takes place at his pleasure. A simple "no" is all
that is needed to stop any prosecutor from filing an indictment against
the person who occupies the office from where his actual prosecutorial
power originates.

Think about it this way: which deputy can arrest the Sheriff? The answer
is *none of them*. In fact, in most counties, they had to pass a
specific law in order to provide for what to do in a circumstance in
which the Sheriff needs to be arrested. Do you know who, in general, is
the person who is authorized by law to arrest the Sheriff? It's the
County Coroner. Break that little tidbit out at your next cocktail
party.

But it's also important to understand that **the power is vested in
the** ***office*, not the** ***person*.** This means that *while that
person holds that office, he cannot be indicted or prosecuted. The
person is subject to the law, but because of the office he holds, he is
immune while he holds the office.* Conversely, this means that *as soon
as the person no longer holds the office, that person is free to be
indicted.* The Constitution has a remedy for effecting this sort of
change, if a president is found to be indictable: **impeachment**. Once
a president has been impeached and removed from office, the US
Attorney's Office can then file indictments against that former
president (who no longer occupies the protected office). If the
president is not impeached, indictments can take place once that
president finishes his or her term in office.

(By the way, if this president were actually guilty of committing a
crime, this whole impeachment drama would be much easier)

And before you complain about "running out the clock," any prosecutor
would actually file indictments in Federal court and when they are told
that they cannot actually indict the President while he is in office,
the statute of limitations would be tolled until the person becomes
eligible for indictment. People doubt this, but that's because it has
never actually happened. There's no reason to believe that the statute
of limitations would not be tolled when the person being indicted is not
eligible for indictment.
