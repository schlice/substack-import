**If a president is not held accountable for refusing to comply with
congressional subpoenas, do we still have a president or do we have a
king?**

If a President is not held accountable for refusing to comply with a
Congressional subpoena, then we have a Congress that is not following
through with its demands.

Presumably, Congress is requesting documents to further its
Constitutional duty to investigate whether or not the President should
be impeached.

The President, on the other hand, is making a Constitutional claim of
executive privilege over the information requested by that subpoena.

In case you were unaware, we happen to have a third branch of government
which is designed to resolve disputes between the first two: the
Judicial Branch.

So, the \$64,000 question: ***Why hasn't Congress requested the courts
enforce their subpoenas?***

There is really only one reasonable answer why Congress wouldn't take
the time to enforce their subpoenas in court.

**Congress is not really interested in finding out the truth.**

Congress is really only interested in hanging a big sign around the
President's neck that says "The House Impeached This President" before
an election. They are not really interested in learning the truth. They
are not really interested in whether or not the President actually
committed high crimes or misdemeanors. They are only interested in
fulfilling their own campaign promises and impeaching the President
before the end of his first term. They will use whatever thin "evidence"
they can gin up to do so. And as of this writing, it appears that this
is exactly what they intend to do. You should expect to see the
President impeached by the House before Christmas.

But this impeachment is different than every other impeachment that has
ever taken place in the United States. This impeachment is a partisan
dog-and-pony show. Every other impeachment had bipartisan support in the
House; this one is wholly partisan. My crystal ball says that no
Republicans will vote for any of the articles of impeachment, and even a
few Democrats will vote against some or all of them.

Impeachments require broad, bipartisan support in order to be taken
seriously.
