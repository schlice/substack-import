**Why has someone not challenged the legitimacy of the reconstruction
amendments?**

Maybe I don't understand what you mean by by challenging the legitimacy
of a Constitutional amendment.

The Amendments (13, 14, and 15) were passed by Congress and ratified by
the states. They followed the Constitutional process to make an
amendment. That makes them *de facto* legitimate Constitutional
amendments.

(EDIT) The OP was actually asking about the argument that the amendments
were illegitimate because the Southern state governments were not
actually legitimate.

This argument usually follows one of two basic argument lines:

1.  The southern state governments were not legitimate because of the
    irregular way in which those governments were created.
2.  Some or all of the ratifications were extorted through unlawful
    federal threats.

There are three basic rationales under which, despite the aforementioned
arguments, the amendments were still valid.

1.  Southern state ratification was unnecessary, because the former
    Confederate states, at the time, were not counted as states as far
    as Article V is concerned, and therefore didn't count in the
    ratification process anyway. And even if all the southern states
    voted against the amendments, there was more than enough support in
    the remainder of the states to ratify them anyway. While this theory
    holds water, I don't really find it particularly persuasive.
2.  Determining whether or not a state's government is lawful is a
    political question which is ultimately decided by Congress. Congress
    recognized the postwar Southern state governments as legitimate. To
    that end, their votes were legitimate, regardless of the actual
    legitimacy of their state governments. This particular argument
    could go either way, in my opinion, so I'll not rely on it as a
    rationale for why the amendments are valid.
3.  The most persuasive argument is the fact that those Southern state
    governments had *de facto authority*. We have long recognized de
    facto government authority in our history. We accept it with other
    world governments, so we also accept it with our state governments.
    Because the Southern state governments exercised de facto authority
    over their states, even if their governments were, in truth,
    illegitimate, their decisions remain binding. Therefore, their votes
    are also binding.
