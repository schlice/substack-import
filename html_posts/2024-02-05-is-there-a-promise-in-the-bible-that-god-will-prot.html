Nope. There is nowhere in the Bible where it says that God will protect
His people from harm. As if God would skip along ahead of us with his
great cosmic leaf blower, sweeping all of our troubles away.

In fact, exactly the opposite is true. The Bible is explicitly clear
that in this world, you will have hardships. I think the evidence from
this world is pretty clear that hardship is a fact of life. Jesus even
said it. John 16:33:

> "I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In
> this world you will have trouble..."

But the key is the second part of that verse:

> "...But take heart! I have overcome the world."

God doesn't promise us an easy life. *Because He promises something*
***infinitely better****.* Instead of a good life, He promises us an
**incredible eternity**.
