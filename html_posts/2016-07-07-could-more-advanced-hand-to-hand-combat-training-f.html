There is a *continuum of force* which officers have at their disposal.
It involves everything from application of hands to pepper spray, the
baton, the Taser, and ends with the firearm. As you can see, it is an
escalating scale. Officers definitely receive training called "arrest
control" which teaches the proper techniques to subdue violent or
resistant suspects, techniques which can control them without causing
permanent damage.

It used to be that officers were far more "hands-on" with policing.
However, over the past few years, that has all changed. Organizations
like Black Lives Matter have spread the false notion that police are the
most dangerous organization in the lives of citizens, and any
application of force by police is an unlawful one. Therefore, every time
police use force, they can be reasonably assured that they are being
recorded and their actions will be used in a civil suit claiming an
unreasonable use of force.

As a result of this anti-cop movement, several things have happened. For
starters, discretionary stops and proactive policing are way down. These
sorts of data-driven policing activities were the proximate cause of the
decrease in violent crime in the 1990's and 2000's. As a result of this
decline in proactive policing strategies, the United States is seeing
its first sustained spike in violent crime in over two decades. Murders
rose nearly 17 percent in the nation's 50 largest cities in 2015, and it
was in cities with large black populations where the violence increased
the most. Baltimore's per capita homicide rate last year was the highest
in its history. Milwaukee had its deadliest year in a decade, with a 72
percent increase in homicides. Homicides in Cleveland increased 90
percent over the previous year. Murders rose 83 percent in Nashville, 54
percent in Washington, DC, and 61 percent in Minneapolis. In Chicago,
where pedestrian stops are down by 90 percent, shootings were up 80
percent through March, 2016.[\[1\]](#IQtWL){#cite-IQtWL .citation_link}

Secondly, police are far less likely to engage in physical altercations
for fear of being the next headline and losing their jobs, justified or
not. They fear the video recording which shows them out of context,
which only shows the application of force, not the incident or the bad
behavior which led to the application of force. Therefore, police are
far quicker to "skip" that step in the force chain, or for that matter,
to skip any step which might be misconstrued as unreasonable force when
applied. Therefore, most cops will completely skip laying hands on a
suspect, or using a baton. They will go straight for the Taser, and if
it is ineffective or not suited for the situation, they will move
directly to the firearm. This is not the fault of the police; they have
been forced into this position; we the public have done this to them.

Do police tend to use fewer tools to subdue violent or resistant
criminals? Yes. They do this because we've made them do it, because we
have demonized other, less-deadly methods to subdue violent or resistant
criminals. It's funny. We've made the police stop using more hands-on
approaches, and now we're upset because police are using less hands-on
approaches.
