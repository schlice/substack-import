It sounds like you're talking about the "Android Device Manager" feature
of your Android phone (where "Find My Mobile" is more of an Apple
moniker).

First, let me answer your specific question. If the perpetrator is able
to access your phone and wipes it or does a hard reset, Android Device
Manager will no longer work, so you will not be able to track your phone
any more.

But I'm here to tell you that **tracking your phone is not important if
it has been truly stolen.** ***Erasing your phone is better than trying
to recover it.*** I'll explain that in a minute.

First, however, if your device has truly been stolen, ***IMMEDIATELY***
go to the [[Android Device
Manager](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=970542&url=https://www.google.com/android/devicemanager){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="google.com"}]{.qlink_container} and log in with your Google
credentials used to set up the phone. Your phone should be located. If
your phone is not located, it is either powered off or has already been
wiped. If it has been located, you should definitely click "Lock" to
lock your phone. If you think the person was not nefarious in their
intent, you can apply a phone number to the lock screen which can be
called to return your phone to you. However, if you believe the phone is
definitely stolen, you should instead click "Erase" to remotely wipe
your phone. If you ever accessed your bank accounts or your email from
your phone (which many people do), you'll want to "Erase" your phone.

It sounds a little harsh to say that you should forget about retrieving
the device, but you must remember that your phone links to your email.
***If a perpetrator gains access to your email, you're in big
trouble.*** Your email is the "skeleton key" to all of your accounts.
The perpetrator can access any of your other accounts which authenticate
you through email and reset their passwords using your email to do it.
Therefore, protecting your email account is of the utmost concern. I
would strongly recommend wiping your phone so that the perpetrator no
longer has access to it.

Forget the hardware. Take the insurance claim and get a new one. But
please, protect your email address. Erase your phone if you can.

Note that if the perpetrator wipes your device, it accomplishes the same
thing as you remotely wiping the device. The hardware is of less
concern; that's why we have insurance. The protection of your personal
information is far more important.
