**Why can the U.S. President just move troops at will?**

Why can the CEO of a corporation relocate a factory from one city to
another? Because he's the CEO.

Why can the President move troops at will? Because he's the
Commander-in-Chief of US Armed Forces. When he says "Move these troops
there," his generals say "Yes, Sir" and they move the troops. Understand
he doesn't make these decisions unilaterally or without counsel. He does
this after discussing the issues with his generals and the component
commanders as are seated on the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
