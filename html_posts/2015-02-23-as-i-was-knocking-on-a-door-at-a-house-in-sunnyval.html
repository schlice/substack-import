**Content:** [Even in states that enforce the \"castle doctrine,\" you
would have to be *in his home, uninvited* before he might perceive you
as a threat and shoot at you.\
\
In the rare cases where someone has been shot outside of the house (i.e.
just on the property), they were, indeed, a clear threat or a known
threat (from the past), either attacking the door attempting to gain
entry, or brandishing a weapon.\
\
Beyond these two cases, you must pose some identifiable threat before
you can be shot. The FedEx guy does not pose a threat, nor does the mail
carrier. A homeowner can demand you leave their property, and if you
fail to do so, the worst that homeowner can do is call the police and
have you cited for trespassing. He has no legal grounds to shoot
you.]{.rendered_qtext}
