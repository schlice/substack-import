So let me get this straight. You know God exists. You know God created
you. But because you didn't *ask* to be born (which makes absolutely no
sense whatsoever, because it means you would have to exist before you
existed), you don't owe God anything.

But God didn't ask you for anything, did He? Is He asking for *payment*
for creating you? Is He asking for *fealty* for creating you? He hasn't
asked you for anything in return. Do you feel like thanking Him for
creating you is some kind of *obligation?*

There is no obligation here. God created you with free will. You can
choose to love Him or reject Him, and it will have zero impact on your
life whatsoever. You can go on about your life and simply pretend He
doesn't exist, and He won't hurt you at all. He'll just let you live,
and let you die.

But at that point, you'll be **gone**. The complete and utter separation
from God will be final, and *eternal*. Your only opportunity to live on
after you die can be secured during this life.

You have an opportunity here. You can learn about why you were created.
You can learn about why Jesus needed to come to earth and die on a
cross. You can learn all of it while you're alive.

Or you can continue to shake your fist at God.

Your choice.
