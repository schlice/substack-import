I think it might be actionable if the aggressor is "making an obscene
phone call" which may be considered sexual harassment. In the case of an
obscene phone call, he would be using his own harassing words to provide
for his own gratification. You could argue that the pretext of the call
was something else, but was actually sexual harassment. If you think
this is what happened, you should talk to an attorney in your area.

However, if he was just listening to you willingly speaking and using
your words as gratification, it is probably not actionable. How he uses
your words is his business. You've willingly spoken your words; you were
not coerced into doing so. Misrepresenting his intention in listening to
your words simply violates **your trust,** it doesn't necessarily
violate **a law.**

Original question:

Is it illegal in the US to use chats or phone for sexual gratification
under false pretense? Involves masturbation. Has victim believeing she
is giving him emotional support while she listens to his past deviancy?
Anyway to punish him if not by law?
