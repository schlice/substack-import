**With Trump's impeachment into its fourth day, is there any hope that
Trump would be removed from the office?**

No. There is no hope of the Senate removing Trump from office.

There simply aren't enough votes there to do it. There's nothing new
that we're going to hear from impeachment managers on either side. In
fact, this is the first time that we'll hear from Trump's legal team, in
an official capacity, laying out a number of lines of legal theory,
including the fact that the charges don't rise to the level of "high
crimes and misdemeanors," and that impeachment under these articles is
exactly what the Founders warned us about: turning impeachment into
partisan exercises and political weapons, instead of being reserved for
only the most egregious crimes, with bi-partisan, overwhelming evidence.
Which, in case you're just tuning in, we don't have.

Since the will of the people is sacrosanct, Trump's team will urge the
Senate to basically "float" the issue until 2020, which the Democrats
are completely against. Basically, don't remove from office on the
grounds that the American people have already seen everything they need
to know, and they will make a decision in November if they want to
remove the President from office.
