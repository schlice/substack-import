When we enter the academy, we are given a paper copy of the Colorado
Revised Statutes. Attached to the inside of the back cover is a CD that
allows you to read all the statutes on a PC.

So I went to Lexis-Nexis and bought an electronic copy of the Colorado
Revised Statutes in PDF format, which sits on my iPad. Very rarely do I
open the book any more.
