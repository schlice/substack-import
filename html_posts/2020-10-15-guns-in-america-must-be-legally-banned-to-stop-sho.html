I can\'t tell you how many times we have answered this question here.
But maybe if I answer it, you\'ll get it. I doubt it, but here goes.

You can\'t make guns illegal, they\'re protected by the Constitution.

But let\'s say, somehow, you got the Second Amendment repealed. How do
you know who has guns? There\'s no national registry, because that\'s
illegal too (not coincidentally, because of this eventuality). You have
over 300 million guns in circulation in the United States. Are you going
to go door to door into every one of 150 million households in the
United States and break down the doors and ransack the houses until you
find the guns and rip them away? That violates a few amendments also,
namely the 4th and 5th amendments. Were you planning on repealing those
as well?

Because if we\'ve gotten to a place in this country where we have
repealed the second, fourth, and fifth amendments, we\'ve pretty much
lost the Constitution. At that point, there\'s nothing preventing the
government from usurping any of your rights, any time they feel like it.
The country, as it was, would be lost.

I also thought that your middle sentence was interesting, the one where
you said you didn\'t want to be hit by a Trump supporter's bullet. So it
would be okay for you to be hit by a Biden supporter's bullet? Or an
Independent's bullet? I wasn\'t sure that the bullets actually cared
what your political affiliation was. But whatever. Maybe you seem to be
of the opinion that only Trump supporters are mass shooters. Maybe you
forgot about the Bernie supporter who shot up the Congressional baseball
game and nearly killed Steve Scalise.
