**Why is it the police are permitted to take people\'s lives? It is not
the job of the police to inflict punishment on people.**

*(US answer only)*

Because in the United States, police officers have the same right to
self-defense as any citizen does.

Despite what you see in the media, police in general are not just out
there indiscriminately killing people. Police, on average, kill about
1000 people per year, the vast majority of those people are armed, and
nearly all of them pose a threat to the officer of death or grave bodily
harm.

Remember, just because a person is not armed with a weapon does not mean
that they do not pose a risk of death or grave bodily harm to the
officer.

*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.
Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a
civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not
misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously. My mental well-being
isn\'t worth your harassing, inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I
wrote, tough shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is
un-cited opinion masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m
wrong, write your own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site,
not a debate site. If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually,
you\'re wrong,\" don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment.
Put anything vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be
followed by a block and a mute. I will do this immediately and with no
compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*
