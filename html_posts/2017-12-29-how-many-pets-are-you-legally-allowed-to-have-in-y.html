**How many pets are you legally allowed to have in your town, and do you
have more pets than the town\'s legal limit?**

Where I live, the city has limits on how many and what types of pets you
can own, and our HOA has tighter restrictions on the same. In our HOA,
I'm reasonably certain (off the top of my head) that you can have no
more than four pets living with you on your property.

I have never heard of this regulation enforced, and even if it was, it
would only be because we had a Crazy Cat Lady who owned 20 cats and took
in another 20 strays and her house smelled like a cat box from a block
away. Not only does that produce a nuisance odor, but it is an
environmental toxin, and hurts the neighborhood overall, so at that
point the HOA would step in.
