We can *cultivate* and *encourage* a culture that values and cares for
life, but we cannot ***create*** one. No one individual or group
*creates* culture, and any attempt to do so sounds way too Orwellian and
Huxley's *Brave New World*-ish to me. Society as a whole creates
culture. The best we can do is to *encourage* people to value and care
for life. If people do not do this on their own, no amount of
encouragement will change their minds.

No one can force anyone else to believe as they do. That's the nature of
free will, and we all have it. We are all free to believe as we wish. If
we do not already value life, no amount of laws will change that.

Therefore, the best we can do as pro-lifers is to, at the very least,
prevent people from killing babies. Valuing life is a long way from
simply not killing babies.

\

Now, if you asked me *personally* how best to create a culture that
values and cares for life, I'd tell you that we would have to get back
to a place where we quit kicking God out of our lives. Once we do that,
we'll start to see that things like valuing life and loving our
neighbors comes naturally. In other words, the reason that we as a
culture do not value life is because we have rejected God.

Now, you as an individual or even a small group may value life, even
without God in your life, but that's nothing more than a happy accident.
We cannot expect society as a whole to magically value life if there is
no arbiter of values outside of themselves. Implicitly necessary for an
entire society to value life is a fundamental belief in God.
