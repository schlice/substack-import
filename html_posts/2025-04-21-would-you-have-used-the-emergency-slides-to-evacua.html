I assume you mean [[this Delta
flight](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2f1e81&url=https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/delta-flight-evacuated-mco-tarmac-after-engine-catches-fire){.external_link

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="fox5atlanta.com"}]{.qlink_container} which was evacuated
using the emergency slides after a fire broke out in one of the tail
pipes of one of the engines.

Since they *did* use the emergency slide, the question is a bit moot.

What ***I*** would do would be to wait for crewmember instructions
before I deployed an emergency slide. If I was in an exit row and was
told to open the door (as with what happened here), I would absolutely
do it and then I'd help the rest of the plane evacuate.
