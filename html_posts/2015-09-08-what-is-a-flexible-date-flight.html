**Content:** [When airlines provide access to their pricing search
engines, they ask you what\'s more important: the day that you depart,
or the price. If the price is more important than the day you leave, you
can conduct your search using price as your guideline, and let the
system pick the day that corresponds with the best
price.]{.rendered_qtext}
