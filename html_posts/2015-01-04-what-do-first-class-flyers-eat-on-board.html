**Content:** [Menus vary widely, mostly dependent on the distance to the
destination. But in all cases, first class can start drinking from the
moment they plant themselves in their chair, often getting drinks during
boarding.\
\
International first class flyers dine as in a restaurant. Often,
business class on international flights eats very similarly to first
class, the luxury of the accommodations being the differentiator (i.e.
business class seats recline really far but not completely flat; first
class seats usually recline completely flat).\
\
(EDIT) I think that \"dining in a restaurant\" may have connotations
that I didn\'t intend. There is no \"stove\" in an airplane, there is no
\"chef\" preparing meals. All meals. including first class meals, are
essentially pre-cooked and then frozen. The meals are then re-heated on
the aircraft. The hot entreé is served on a tray with the remaining
cold/room temperature food items.\
\
Domestically (two-class aircraft), first class gets what Economy used to
get back in the day: a choice of hot entreé on a tray with fruit, salad,
bread, and dessert.\
\
Economy now has buy-on-board boxed food, which actually isn\'t too bad,
it\'s just not included in the price of your ticket any more. Some of
the buy-on-board boxed meals are warm as well.]{.rendered_qtext}
