**It is often said a flight is safer than a car ride. How can that be
known, when the total number of car ride per day can\'t be known?**

While we don't know exactly how many cars are on the road in a given
day, we can extrapolate that number.

Besides, comparing fatalities in automobile crashes to fatalities in
aircraft crashes reveals a massive difference, and we do know how many
people fly each year.
