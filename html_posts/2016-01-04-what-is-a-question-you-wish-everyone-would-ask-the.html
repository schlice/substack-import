*What is the one thing I can do, today, to improve my own life and the
lives of those who share mine?*

Do this every day. Don't worry about making huge changes in your life
right now. Make a small change, every day, to improve your life. Think
about the people you love, and ask yourself what they would need.

Put this above question on a sticky note and put it on your bathroom
mirror so you see it every morning. Small changes, over time, amount to
a big difference.
