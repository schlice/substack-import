**Does the law require you to file a police report for minor
accidents?**

All states are different, and most states do require that you at least
file a police report online even if you don't call the police to the
scene.

In Colorado, for example, you *must* call the police to the scene if any
of the following occur:

- if anyone involved is injured or killed
- there is damage to public property like a light pole or a guard rail
- one of the participants in the accident leaves the scene (a
  hit-and-run)
- one of the drivers appears to be under the influence of drugs or
  alcohol

While you may not need to call the police to the scene, you still are
required to report the accident, which you can do online.

Even if your state does not require you to file a police report, it's a
good idea to do it. Insurance companies use police reports to provide an
independent assessment of the accident and its causes, and insurance
will use those reports to help them determine liability (i.e. who is
responsible).

Even if you decide to not file a claim with your insurance company, what
if the other party does, and their insurance company attempts to make a
claim against your policy, claiming you were responsible? If you were
not, having a police report could help to prove that.

Additionally, if you are injured (and some injuries are not immediately
apparent), and the accident was not your fault, someone will have to pay
for those medical bills, and it shouldn't be you. A police report can
help your health insurance to get reimbursed for their payouts to you,
and it may prevent you from having to pay anything out of pocket, or at
least to get reimbursed for what you do pay. You shouldn't have to pay
when someone else is at fault.
