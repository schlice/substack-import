**How do you get arrested for false imprisonment?**

Detain someone against their will. This is either called "false arrest"
or "false imprisonment"

Stores have to be keenly aware of this, as "shopkeeper's privilege" can
easily turn into false imprisonment if you detain someone's free
movement against their will and you don't have probable cause to suspect
the person is a shoplifter.

In most cases, only security guards or loss prevention can detain
someone from leaving a store citing shopkeeper's privilege, but as in
all things legal. these shopkeeper's privilege rules vary wildly from
state to state.
