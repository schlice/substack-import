**What if I can\'t find the restrictions button on my iPhone?**

Well then, you can't enable or disable restrictions.

In iOS 12, Restrictions have been rolled into the new Screen Time
software, which is probably why you can't find it.

The first time you run Screen Time, you'll want to "Set Up as a Parent."
That way, you'll be able to set up Downtime, App Limits, Content &
Privacy, and create your Parent Passcode.
