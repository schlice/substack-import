It's not irrelevant to the "abortion debate/problem." It's **central**
to it.

Why?

**Because if it's not alive, then you're not killing it by removing it**
and no one would care. Pro-life people would have nothing to object to,
because you're not actually causing a death to an existing life, you're
only removing some structure which will one day become a life. It's the
classic "clump of cells" reduction, which only fails because the baby
is, in fact, *alive.*

If the baby is alive, then it deserves the same protections as any other
live human being, regardless of how early in its development it is, or
whether it can survive on its own, or whether it is even physically
recognizable as a human. So the distinction about "when life begins" is
**central** to the pro-life/pro-choice debate.

Whether or not it is "alive" and whether or not it is "human" are both
questions with easy, well-recognized scientific answers, despite
breathless apologetics by the stridently pro-choice crowd. Truly honest
embryologists agree that the life created at conception is a unique
human organism, so we know it is "human." It exhibits all of the
characteristics of life: cellular organization, the ability to
reproduce, growth & development, energy use, homeostasis, response to
their environment, and the ability to adapt. It is, definitionally,
"alive."

Rather than debating these points, pro-choice people would be much
better served if they stipulated to the fact that they are fully aware
that the baby is alive, but they are okay with killing it because: it
can't live on its own, it is a parasite, it doesn't even look human,
there's no brain, there's no heart, the mother's life is more important,
etc. These are fine arguments to make. We kill people all the time in
today's society. Police legally kill about a thousand people a year in
the United States. We execute criminals lawfully in today's society. And
in some states, physician-assisted suicide is legal. So saying that
lawfully some humans can be killed is not a stretch. It's just
articulating the argument that causes the issue.

Despite endless cries to the contrary, there is really only one
difference between the pro-life and the pro-choice positions. When you
strip them down to their most essential difference, this is it:

- Pro-life people place **equal value on all life** at all times, and
  that includes both the baby and the mother. Neither life is more
  important than the other.ยน
- Pro-choice people place **differential value on the life of the baby**
  depending on its *temporal locality.* A "temporal locality" is a
  position in both space and time. In other words, pro-choice people
  place different value on the life of the baby depending on where
  physically, and when in time, it is located. During those times, **the
  life of the mother has more value than the life of the baby.**

That's it. Trying to say that it's something other than this is
disingenuous, and is usually just emotion talking instead of reason.

\

ยน The "life of the mother" exception still can co-exist with placing
equal value on all life. If a mother's life is being threatened by a
continuing pregnancy, that pregnancy should be able to be ended in order
to save her life.
