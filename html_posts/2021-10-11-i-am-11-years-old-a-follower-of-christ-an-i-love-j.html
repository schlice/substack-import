I am 49 years old, and I've done more bad than I care to remember. It
took me waaaaay longer to come to know Christ than it did for you. You
should count yourself lucky that you know Christ at such a young age!

Since none of us can go back and undo anything we have done, all we can
do is work from today forward. Remember the only things that God
requires of us, right now, to secure our salvation: **repent** and
**believe.** Right? Isn't that what is required of the believer? Repent
of (or be sorry for) your sins, and believe that Christ is the risen
Lord who died on the cross to pay for our sins.

So the question then becomes: *have you done this*? Have you truly
repented of your earlier bad things? And do you believe that Christ is
your savior and he died on the cross to take the punishment for your
sins?

If you do, then your debt has been paid, and you have nothing more to
worry about.

So how do you know? If you have truly repented of your sins and have
accepted Christ into your heart, you should start to see a change in
your life. You should start to see those old, sinful ways of thinking
and acting begin to fade away. In other words, the *desire* to do those
things will start to fade. You'll think about those things and say,
"Meh, I don't want to do that. I want to honor God and respect his rules
instead." Over time, it will become easier and easier to choose God's
way instead of man's sinful ways.

You've already made great strides being where you are at your age, and
I'm very proud of you! Now, ***believe what you've said*** and live by
that faith. Keep God in your mind. Be deliberate about thinking about
God when you wake up, and be deliberate about thinking about him before
you go to bed. Think about your love for Christ as you interact with
other people. It will get easier and easier, I promise!

Remember: God will never give up on you. He will never turn his back on
you. He will always love you. There is nothing you can do that will
separate you from his love. Now, you just have to accept it.

Original question:

I am 11 years old, a follower of Christ, an I love Jesus so much, but
I've done so many wrong things and bad sins that I feel ashamed and not
forgiven. Please help? :(
