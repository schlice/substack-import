Sexual assault is terrible. The fact that it has gone on for so long in
this country is deplorable. We need to start having **more, open,** and
**honest** conversations about sexual assault and affirmative consent in
this country.

However, today's trend of *accusers destroying men's lives with nothing
more than an accusation* is disturbing. We have shifted the burden *way*
too far towards the accuser, and have removed much of the recourse of
the accused. And this sometimes (not always, but sometimes) leads to
some people *taking advantage* of that imbalance.

In fact, some of Trump's accusers have been accused of lying about their
accusations. Some have even been accused of being *paid* to lie. We
don't yet know whether or not this is true, but if it is, it is just as
abhorrent as sexual assault.

So, the \$64,000 question (yes, I just dated myself): *How do we address
this?*

Perhaps this is a good time in this country to talk about some
***alternative remedies*** to this problem.

- Perhaps it's time to hand this problem over to the courts. Yes, it
  will increase the workload on the court system, but perhaps this is
  the time to do it. We could do this by increasing the statute of
  limitations on sexual assault crimes. Aren't sexual assaults just as
  important to address as rape? Or murder? If you think so (and the
  national attention currently being given to these stories seems to
  agree), then maybe you should suggest some real change by increasing
  the statute of limitations on sexual assault crimes.
- Perhaps it's time to have a discussion about affirmative consent laws.
  Maybe we should start pressuring our state legislatures to enact some
  solid affirmative consent laws. Some states have already started to do
  so, but the laws are patchy around the country, and don't cover every
  situation. Some states have elected to address the issues on college
  campuses, while making no changes to the laws covering the remainder
  of their populations.

I think we could really make some positive changes rather than gutting
our own legal check-and-balance systems as we are.
