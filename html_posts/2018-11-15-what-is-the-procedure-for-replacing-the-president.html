Under the [[Presidential Succession Act of
1947](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c34707&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Succession_Act){.external_link

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}, if both the President
and Vice President resign at the same time, succession of the President
will follow like this:

- Speaker of the House
- President pro tempore of the Senate
- Secretary of State
- Secretary of the Treasury
- Secretary of War, 1947, now Secretary of Defense
- Attorney General
- Postmaster General, 1947--1970
- Secretary of the Navy, 1947
- Secretary of the Interior
- Secretary of Agriculture
- Secretary of Commerce
- Secretary of Labor
- Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, 1965--1979, now Secretary
  of Health and Human Services
- Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, since 1965
- Secretary of Transportation, since 1966
- Secretary of Energy, since 1977
- Secretary of Education, since 1979
- Secretary of Veterans Affairs, since 1988
- Secretary of Homeland Security, since 2006

The President will then appoint a Vice President. They will serve until
the end of the current term. If they serve longer than two years, it
will be counted as one full term and they could only be re-elected once.
If they serve fewer than two years, that portion of a term does not
count, and they can be elected twice.
