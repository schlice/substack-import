**I see a man with a gun walking down my street and there\'s a kid
playing outside. What should I do?**

Depends on the law in your locality. We're presuming you live in the US.

If your state does not permit open carry of firearms, call the police
and tell them someone is open carrying a firearm. Let the police handle
it. The cost of disallowing open carry needs to be passed back to the
government, and if they find its enforcement to be too expensive, they
will either change it or increase funding to the police.

If your state does permit open carry of firearms, then you have not
provided enough information to determine whether or not you should be
worried. Is the firearm being carried incorrectly? If it is a handgun,
is it in a holster? If it is a rifle, is it on a sling? Is it being
carried correctly? Is the person being threatening with it? You have a
lot of questions to answer before you can determine what to do.
