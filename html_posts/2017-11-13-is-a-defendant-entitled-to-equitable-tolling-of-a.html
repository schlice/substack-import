Tolling is not a function of equity, nor is tolling reimbursement for
law enforcement cooperation. In general, the statute of limitations is
in place to protect the defendant. It is the *plaintiff* who benefits
through tolling of the statute of limitations, so that he can avoid
having the statute lapse for failure to bring an action.

Tolling of the statute of limitations on a particular action occurs when
some outside force causes "legal disability," or a lack of legal
capacity to take an action. Once that disability is removed, the time
starts again.
