**Content:** [If the man was too drunk to consent to sex, he could
charge the sober woman with rape. And no, physical arousal does not
constitute consent.\
\
Best advice I can offer: try to avoid having sex with drunk guys. If
they\'ll have sex with you only when they\'re drunk, move on. They\'re
not worth it and you\'re better than that.]{.rendered_qtext}
