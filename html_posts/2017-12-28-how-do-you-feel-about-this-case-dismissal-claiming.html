It makes perfect sense. Only the injured party can bring suit, and
according to the judge:

> *As the only political branch with the power to consent to violations
> of the Foreign Emoluments Clause, Congress is the appropriate body to
> determine whether, and to what extent, Defendant's conduct unlawfully
> infringes on that power. If Congress determines that an infringement
> has occurred, it is up to Congress to decide whether to challenge or
> acquiesce to Defendant's conduct. As such, this case presents a
> non-justiciable political question.*

In other words, violations of the Emoluments Clause are political
questions for Congress to address, not legal questions for lawsuits to
address.
