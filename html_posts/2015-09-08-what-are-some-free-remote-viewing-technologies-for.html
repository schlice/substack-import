**Content:** [There are plenty of free ones available, but two things
stand in your way:\

]{.rendered_qtext}

1.  You can handle 90% of your customers\' issues by using something
    like Windows Remote Assistance, as long as your customer is using
    Windows 7 or higher. You\'d have to talk them through sending you an
    assistance request, and there are still factors which might hamper
    the support experience (internet connection speeds, firewalls, etc)\
2.  If you want to produce a reliable, secure remote support experience,
    I would seriously consider a contract for a pay service.
    Additionally, most of the free solutions I know of are only free for
    personal use. Using one of these solutions in a business setting
    still requires a license. So if you are looking to provide a
    service, you can use any old software. If you\'re looking to provide
    a reliable service that your customers would brag about, I would
    most definitely go with some contracted pay service. Some of the
    ones I would seriously consider:

- TeamViewer
- GoToAssist
- LogMeIn Rescue
- join.me
- Webex
