In just the same way that you shouldn't take medical advice from
politicians, don't take legal advice from people who are not your
lawyer. Don't take legal advice from me, either. But I've got one or two
years experience under my belt; I can keep you out of jail better than
what you've apparently been told about a repo.

Maybe you forgot that you don't own the car yet. It doesn't belong to
you. It belongs to the lender or leasing agency (depending on whether
you took out a loan to buy or you are leasing), and you are working on
buying it, but you haven't made all the payments yet. You don't hold the
title to the car, the lender or the leasing agency does.

About the only part they got right is the part in which they can't tow
it with a person inside of it. However, if you jump in your car and
refuse to get out, the tow truck driver will call the police. The police
officer will order you out of the car, at which point you have one of
two options: you get out of the car on your own and maybe you get to
leave on your own, or you are dragged out of the car in which case
you're going to jail.

In many states, it is a *crime* to get in a car which is legally in the
possession of a tow operator (once the tow hook is on the car, it is
legally in the possession of the tow company), and you can go to jail
for that act alone, let alone refusing to follow the lawful orders of a
police officer.

Repossession is the natural consequence of a contract you signed. If you
fail to make the payments on your car, it gets repossessed. Your
complaint is not with the tow truck driver; your complaint is with the
lender or leasing agency. And if the repo driver has your car on his
list, he's bringing your car in, plain and simple. Neither the repo
driver nor the police officer really care that you have problem X that
is preventing you from paying, or that the leasing agency is screwing
you personally over, or anything else you choose to tell them. Your
complaint is with the lender or leasing agency, end of discussion.

Original question:

I just heard someone say \"If your car is getting repossessed, jump in
the car because they can\'t legally tow it and police can\'t stop it."
What\'s your take?
