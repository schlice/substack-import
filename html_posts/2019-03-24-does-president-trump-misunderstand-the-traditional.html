**Does President Trump misunderstand the traditional separation between
a president and his Justice Department?**

Not at all, because there is no separation.

**He is their boss**.

The Department of Justice is an Executive Branch office who works *at
the pleasure of the President*.

The Constitution states in Article II Section 1, "The executive power
shall be vested in a President of the United States of America." The
power to prosecute is an executive power, given *solely* to the
President. Attorneys general and the Department of Justice undertakes
prosecutions through *delegation of the authority of the President*.
That means the DOJ only prosecutes people with the implied consent of
the President, who has delegated such authority to them.

This is also the reason why the DOJ can't indict a sitting president. It
is his power, and he would have to consent to its use on himself, which
he most certainly would not do. Therefore, looking at it
Constitutionally, the DOJ cannot indict him for a crime. They would have
to refer the matter to Congress to begin impeachment proceedings, the
correct Constitutional remedy.

**TL;DR: There is no separation. He is their boss. They work for him,
and they derive their authority directly from him.**
