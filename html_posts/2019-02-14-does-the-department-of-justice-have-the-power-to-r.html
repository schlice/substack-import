**Does the Department of Justice have the power to remove Trump by
invoking the 25th Amendment?**

No. The Department of Justice works for the President. They do not have
any authority under the 25th Amendment.

The entire purpose of the 25th Amendment is to define how the Vice
President takes control from the President. It allows the Vice President
to *assume* the authority of the President when he is incapacitated to
such a degree that he cannot *cede* control to someone else, and it
allows the President to *cede* authority to the Vice President if he
cannot fulfill his duty. That's why there is all of that complex
language in Section 4 about the President telling Congress that he *is*
actually fit to resume duty, and there being Congressional hearings to
determine if that is the case.

The DOJ, which works for the President, is not involved in the process.
