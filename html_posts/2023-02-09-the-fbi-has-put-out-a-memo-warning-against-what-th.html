This memo was leaked by Kyle Seraphin, who was a special agent at the
bureau for six years before he was indefinitely suspended without pay in
June 2022. He published the document "Interest of Racially or Ethnically
Motivated Violent Extremists in Radical Traditionalist Catholic Ideology
Almost Certainly Presents New Mitigation Opportunities," on

There are significant problems with this particular FBI work product.
The document warned against "radical traditionalist Catholic ideology,"
and claimed it "almost certainly presents new mitigation opportunities,"

In part, the document reads: "In making this assessment, FBI Richmond
relied on the key assumption that \[racially or ethnically motivated
extremists\] will continue to find \[radical-traditionalist Catholic or
RTC\] ideology attractive and will continue to attempt to connect with
RTC adherents, both virtually via social media and in-person at places
of worship,."

It adds that "RTCs are typically categorized by the rejection of the
Second Vatican Council (Vatican II) as a valid church council; disdain
for most of the popes elected since Vatican II, particularly Pope
Francis and Pope John Paul II; and frequent adherence to anti-Semitic,
anti-immigrant, anti-LGBTQ, and white supremacist ideology.
Radical-traditionalist Catholics compose a small minority of overall
Roman Catholic adherents and are separate and distinct from
'traditionalist Catholics' who prefer the Traditional Latin Mass and
pre-Vatican II teachings and traditions, without the more extremist
ideological beliefs and violent rhetoric."

One of the big problems I can see right away is that the definition of
an RTC is very broad. In fact, many non-Catholic sects could easily be
swept up in that definition since they, by default, reject the papacy,
and are often labeled as anti-LGBTQ because they adhere to traditional
Biblical views of marriage and sexuality.

The other big problem I have with the report: it relied heavily on
information from the Southern Poverty Law Center, an organization which
includes conservative nonprofit organizations like the Family Research
Council, Alliance Defending Freedom and the American College of
Pediatricians on its list of "hate groups" alongside groups like the Ku
Klux Klan and the Nation of Islam. Seraphin said that "a real
intelligence product would quote \[SPLC\] and say, 'unsubstantiated.'"

He also said that if an intelligence product were to cite *Salon* (as
the leaked document does) it would need to cite a separate "source on
the other side." This document does not.

The FBI had previously excluded the SPLC from reports because "there was
no analytical rigor or basis for the majority of their assertions that
they would write about on their website" according to George Hill, a
former supervisory intelligence analyst.

Therefore, this memo feels like an attack on Christianity.
