**How many police officers are in the US?**

There is no central repository for that kind of information, as law
enforcement is a state-level function.

There are over 18,000 Federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies
around the United States, and it is estimated that there are between
750,000 and 850,000 sworn officers. If you count non-sworn personnel who
work for police departments, you get over 1 million.
