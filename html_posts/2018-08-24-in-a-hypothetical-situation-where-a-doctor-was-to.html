**In a hypothetical situation where a doctor was to save either a cop or
a criminal, from an ethical standpoint, what would be the right thing to
do?**

*Ethically*, you save the one who has the best chance of survival. Even
in a hypothetical scenario, people are physiologically different, and
there will always be one or the other (profession aside) who will have a
better chance of surviving.

Once you rate the percentage chance of survival, if you can only treat
one (which is the hypothetical I'm assuming you are referring to), you
treat the one with the higher percentage chance of survival.
