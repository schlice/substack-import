**If Congress does not impeach Individual 1 (Trump), but the states find
enough evidence there were crimes committed, can he still be indicted
after he leaves office?**

If the state has standing (i.e. a crime was committed in that state),
the state can most certainly file charges against Trump after he leaves
office.

**What could that mean for Trump, his businesses and his pardoned
associates?**

For Trump and his businesses: he defends himself in exactly the same way
as any other business owner charged with a crime.

For *his pardoned associates:* they are not subject to those charges, as
they have already been pardoned for any crimes they may have committed.
