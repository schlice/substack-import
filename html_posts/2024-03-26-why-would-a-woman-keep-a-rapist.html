Some believe that enough trauma has been done, and compounding the
trauma of a rape with the trauma of an abortion is unnecessary.

Some believe that the baby is an innocent third-party and is not the
perpetrator of a rape. They believe the baby is as much a victim as the
mother, and no one is suggesting we kill the rape victim, so why kill
another victim?

Some women understand that abortion isn't a treatment for rape. It
doesn't change what happened. It only creates more pain and more
suffering, and it actually kills a human being.

Some women believe that by bringing the baby to term (and optionally
keeping the baby), they can bring *some* good out of the tragedy that is
a criminal rape.

So before you angrily type out a comment, I'm not advocating for any
position. I'm 100% against rape in all forms. I'm not trying to tell
women what to do. I'm not angling to force women to become mothers. I am
aware that pregnancy changes a woman, permanently, for the rest of her
life. This is not necessarily a bad thing, it is just a thing.

On the flip side, I believe that killing babies is wrong. I also know
that Safe Haven laws exist in all 50 states, and state-funded prenatal
care also exists, along with options for no or low-cost care for the
remainder of a pregnancy. Pregnancy Resource Centers (PRCs) do exist,
despite the best efforts of some to shut them down. They would have all
the information on prenatal health care available as well as funding
sources to help with that care. They also have information and supplies
for post-natal support (if the woman chooses to keep the baby, as some
do).

EDIT: If you comment and you have me blocked so that I cannot respond, I
automatically, and with no thought or compunction at all, delete your
comment. If you want your comment to remain, make sure you don't have me
blocked.
