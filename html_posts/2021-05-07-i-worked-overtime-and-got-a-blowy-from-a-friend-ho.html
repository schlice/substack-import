Ah yes, the Bill Clinton School of Sex: "I. DID NOT. HAVE. SEXUAL.
RELATIONS. WITH. THAT. WOMAN."

In actuality, it was that event that began the change in society wherein
oral sex was not considered sex. It's been called the "Clinton-Lewinsky
Effect."

These days, only around 20% of young adults consider oral sex to be sex.
They consider it to be "foreplay." But in the eyes of the law and health
professionals, it is.

But that's not the question you asked. The question you asked was **is
it cheating**?

I love this answer to that question:

So let me ask you this question: if your partner told you that she got a
licky from a co-worker and she rubbed him out, but they didn't actually
have sex, how would you feel?

**If you haven't discussed this with your partner, then that's why you
feel guilty.**

Take the time and discuss it. If your partner is not okay with it, then
you have a decision to make. Either change your behavior and be more
respectful towards your current partner, or leave that relationship.

Original question:

I worked overtime and got a blowy from a friend. How come I feel a bit
guilty even though I didn\'t actually have sex so not really cheating?
