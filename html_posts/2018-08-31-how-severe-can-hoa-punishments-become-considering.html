**How severe can HOA punishments become, considering you OWN the
property?**

The answer is "it depends." Don't forget, the HOA has an ownership
interest in the entire neighborhood, even though you are the deeded
owner on your house. Your Governing Documents determine just how bad it
can get. In some cases, if there is something on the outside of your
home that needs to be fixed, the HOA will hire contractors to fix it and
then bill you for the work. In others, they will simply demand you fix
it and will continually fine you until you do.

In most HOAs, the remedy for the HOA is fines. However, if you don't pay
your fines (or any work they may have done and billed to you), they can
put a lien on your house. If you continue to not pay your fines, the HOA
can foreclose on your lien to get their money (which means you no longer
own your house).
