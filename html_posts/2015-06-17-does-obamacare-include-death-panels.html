**Content:** [The Independent Payment Advisory Panel (or Independent
Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB) is an independent panel which is
responsible for keeping Medicare costs down. Sounds innocent enough. The
rub is how they plan on doing so.\
\
The former chief of Medicare [[has
said](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=df8c6b&url=http://dailycaller.com/2010/05/27/death-panels-were-an-overblown-claim-until-now/){.external_link

qt-tooltip="dailycaller.com"}]{.qlink_container} that it\'s cheaper to
let people die (or in more technical terms, to simply provide palliative
care) than to treat them with traditional treatments. Obamacare
therefore invented this board, which is truly independent. No
Congressional oversight, and no input from doctors either. This board
essentially gets to make the decisions as to what doctors you can see,
what treatments you can get, and whether or not you can get care at
all.\
\
Sounds like a death panel to me. If it walks like a duck\...\

[[Forbes](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=378bfa&url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/sallypipes/2015/06/15/two-more-pieces-of-obamacare-may-be-on-their-way-out/){.external_link

qt-tooltip="forbes.com"}]{.qlink_container} says, \"If Medicare spending
exceeds limits set by law, then IPAB can impose its own set of cost
controls\... Once IPAB settles on its cuts, lawmakers must either offer
an alternative plan that cuts the same level of spending or muster a
super-majority to block the Board\'s cuts from taking effect.\" IPAB
independently decides what care to deliver, and unless Congress can
muster a super-majority (ha ha), it\'s unlikely that anyone can stop
it.\
\
Both sides of the aisle are pushing to abolish IPAB. Many groups which
are in favor of the ACA are pushing for IPAB\'s disbandment. In
committee alone, the repeal motion had [[20 Democratic
co-sponsors.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e1d75b&url=http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/245109-house-gops-focus-on-obamacare-excludes-court-case){.external_link

\
As the opposition to this law pointed out before its inception, the cost
to take care of sick people, which is the bulk of people using the
coverage, is too high for the program to bear. Already, insurance
providers are pushing for rate hikes in the state Exchanges, in some
states as high as 51%. [[Only

rates. Wonder what they\'re doing right up there\...]{.rendered_qtext}
