You do not have the right to never be offended.

Lewis Napper, who ran for the Senate in Mississippi against Trent Lott,
penned a piece called the "Bill of No Rights" after listening to Hillary
Clinton on the radio in 1993. It is so commonsense and cool, I'll quote
it here. Take note of Article II.

Note that Lewis' website no longer exists. This piece was scoured from
Web Archives.
