**What do pro-life believers think about women who have gotten pregnant
by either rape, incest, or other means, should the mother have a voice
and choose to not carry the burden which wasn\'t her fault?**

Let me first state that this is a legal discussion and I am a student of
the law. While I may have moral concerns about these issues, that does
not drive my view of the law. My personal moral stances are my own and
are not relevant as part of a legal discussion.

Legally, I don't look at rights (i.e. right to life, right of autonomy
over one's body, etc) because if the fetus is a human being (which it
is), it has human rights endemic to human beings. The fetus has as much
right to life as the mother. Legally, neither has more rights than the
other.

When we discuss rape or other means of pregnancy (i.e. coercion), the
only issue we can discuss is **consent**. That issue simply is: *did the
mother consent to sex?*

Consent is important, because consent, either expressed or implied,
means that the woman accepts the consequences of sex. Those include the
possibility of catching an STI, or the possibility of getting pregnant.
All of these are accepted by the woman who consents to sex. For example,
the woman who consents to sex accepts the responsibility of contracting
an STI. The notable exception here, of course, is foreknowledge. You
have to know that your partner has an STI. If you didn't know, you have
legal grounds to sue your partner for sexual battery, regardless of
state.

If a woman does not consent to sex, either through some form of rape
(incest can be a form of rape; consensual incest is still consenting) or
coercion, she should not be legally bound to the consequences of that
sex. She should not be forced to carry the baby to term, if she doesn't
choose to do so.

It's important to understand that not all women who were raped choose to
abort their babies. Actually a very large majority choose to carry the
baby to term. At that point, they either choose to keep the baby, or
give it up for adoption. But in any case, the woman should have *all*
choices available to her. Abortion should rightly be the *last* choice,
as even abortion advocates want it to be a rare occurrence; but in this
case, it should still be on the table.
