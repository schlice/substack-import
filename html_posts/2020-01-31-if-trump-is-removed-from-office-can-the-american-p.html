**If Trump is removed from office, can the American people sue to make
him pay back the money he\'s spent on his golf outings?**

You can sue anyone for anything, and once Trump leaves office (either
through the natural end of his term or by being removed from office), he
is an ordinary ex-President citizen and is subject to lawsuits and
indictments and everything else that ordinary ex-President citizens are.

So you can indeed sue him to try to make him pay back the money he's
spent on vacations, but the question would be how likely you would be to
prevail.

The problem here is thinking that the President is getting something for
nothing. Like somehow "all his golf outings" are some massive benefit
that is so much more amazing than his actual job (you know, being the
leader of the free world and all).

Any time a President goes on vacation anywhere (whether it's Trump
playing golf or the Obamas vacationing in Hawai'i), they require Secret
Service protection. They also require all of the things that the
President needs to effectively run the country from wherever he is
(secure transportation, medical teams, communication, mobile office,
etc). This is what costs the money, not the golf outing. Heck, Trump
probably gets his tee time for free. It's not like it is some boondoggle
that the country is "forced" to pay for. Every president has taken
vacations, and every time they have done so, the taxpayers have paid for
his advance teams and his travel teams to go with him. Every. Single.
Time. Trump is no different. There is never an expectation that any
President would not take vacations.

So you could try to make him pay for his golf outings, but you'll never
be able to recoup the money that the government spent to protect him and
ensure his safety and the continuity of operations of the government.
He'd probably *willingly* pay back any greens fees in such a lawsuit (if
there were any), but the bulk of the cost is not in the actual golf
outing.
