And you didn\'t read my whole comment. The salient detail:

*The fuel pump technician is one of those three million hard-to-fill
jobs that require someone with a very specialized skillset who is in
high demand.* ***The problem is that the job doesn\'t pay well enough
for the company to afford to hire an unskilled worker and pay for their
training with no guarantee that said employee won\'t jump ship as soon
as they are fully trained and certified.*** *The new hire must come in
the door already trained in that specialty for the employer to get any
return on their investment. It\'s up to the new hire to pay for the
vocational training they need to get a job in such a market.*
