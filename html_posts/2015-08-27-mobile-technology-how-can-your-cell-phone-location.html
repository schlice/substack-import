**Content:** [If a phone is actually \"powered off\", the GPS chip and
the cellular radio are off. The phone cannot be tracked.\
\
Some people confuse \"powering off\" the phone with putting the phone in
\"standby,\" which also involves the power button (which is where the
confusion comes from).\
]{.rendered_qtext}

- If you simply \"click\" the power button, the display will go out.
  This is *standby mode*. The phone is still on. It is still capable of
  transmitting and receiving. If you \"click\" the power button again,
  the phone will \"wake up.\" To test it out, click the power button so
  the display turns off and then try to call the phone number of the
  phone. The display will light up and the phone will ring.
- If you hold down the power button until the display says either
  \"Slide to power off\" or a dialog box pops up which includes a
  \"Power Off\" function and you do it (slide or click), the phone will
  *power off*. In this state, the software shuts down, the radios turn
  off, and the phone stops drawing power from the battery. To turn the
  phone back on, you will have to hold the power button momentarily. You
  will see the software of the phone restarting (on iOS, you will see
  the white apple, on Android, you will see the hardware manufacturer\'s
  start screen first, then probably a carrier logo screen) before the
  home screen appears again. To test it out, turn the phone off in this
  manner and then try to call the number. The call should proceed
  directly to the carrier\'s voicemail system, as the phone is not
  contactable on any cell tower.
