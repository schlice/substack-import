I think you need to define what you mean by "bigotry."

Bigotry, as far as I am aware, is defined as "obstinate or unreasonable
attachment to a belief, opinion, or faction, in particular **prejudice
against a person or people on the basis of their membership of a
particular group**." I don't see this as the primary motivator for
people who discuss Catholicism from the outside in. I simply see it as a
lack of good communication.

Christian apologists have a fine line to walk. We have to show that
Catholic beliefs are unbiblical while still honoring the Catholic's
freedom to believe exactly as they choose to believe, as well as making
sure that our message does not come across as "you're a bad person for
believing this." Unfortunately, anyone who has their personal and
deeply-held beliefs questioned feels defensive, so it could be easily
*perceived* as bigoted. And that's a difficult message to deliver. And
with our current communication platforms, it's really difficult to
deliver that message in a way which conveys a message of honoring Christ
and shepherding believers to correct, Biblically-based belief. People
online are too quick to point to others and say "your belief is
unbiblical" without explaining "but you are not a bad person for
believing it" and it just comes across as bigoted.

Finally, the issue may be that we are commanded to spread the Gospel
message, but the vast majority of people implementing that command don't
know how to properly do it. This makes it even more difficult for those
of us who do.
