I will not say yes, because Nexplanon is *mostly* effective at
preventing pregnancy.

It is a **birth control hormone**, which is slowly released over time
into your body. It's exactly like taking the pill, but without having to
remember to take a pill.

It is greater than 99% effective. In studies, less than 1 woman out of
100 with the Nexplanon implant got pregnant. But that is not zero. There
is a risk of pregnancy with Nexplanon. It is just a very low risk.

It's also important to know that the implant does not protect you
against other things that can happen during unprotected sex, like the
transmission of *sexually transmitted infections* (STIs).

So for the most part, you can safely have unprotected sex with your
significant other without having to worry *too much* about unplanned
pregnancy. So long as you understand the risks.

Talk to your doctor about your questions when you talk to him or her
about getting any implanted birth control.
