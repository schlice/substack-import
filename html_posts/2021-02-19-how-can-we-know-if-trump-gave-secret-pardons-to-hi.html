**How can we know if Trump gave secret pardons to himself and his
family?**

You can't. Because they're secret.

But from what we can tell, if they exist, they're probably
unconstitutional. We won't know until Trump tries to use one, assuming
he issued a secret pardon and then stuffed it in a safe deposit box to
be withdrawn if he is ever tried for a crime. It's never been done
before, so there is no precedent. I'm also pretty sure that the courts
would not look too kindly on the validity of a secret pardon.

While there is no specific format for which pardons must follow, the
framers knew that the check against presidential abuse of the pardon
power was the fact that they are public. The public has the opportunity
to judge the behavior of the president and vote accordingly, and this
includes his use of his pardon power.
