**Will Strzok sue the justice department for wrongful termination? Will
he win or lose if he does?**

He can try. But his *conduct*, as is clearly spelled out in the
Department of Justice's Inspector General report, does not present him
in the best light.

We knew since the DOJ filed its IG report on the Hillary investigation
that Strzok had some problems, saying that his text messages between
himself and his mistress, Lisa Page, "potentially indicated or created
the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or
improper considerations," and added that Strzok's behavior was "not only
indicative of a biased state of mind but, even more seriously, implies a
willingness to take official action to impact the presidential
candidate's electoral prospects." The report found that Strzok's
decision to put the Russia probe ahead of the Hillary investigation
could have been tainted by the same bias. The report said, "Under these
circumstances, we did not have confidence that Strzok's decision to
prioritize the Russia investigation over following up on the
Midyear-related investigative lead discovered on the Weiner laptop was
free from bias." Finally, the investigation determined that **Strzok's
activities were "antithetical to the core values of the FBI and the
Department of Justice."**

It is statements like these which would lead any reasonable person to
believe that a termination was not only not wrongful, but nearly
required, especially from an agency which is supposed to engender public
trust.

The only thing that could work against the FBI is what is known as
"implied promises." According to the Washington Compost, the FBI's
disciplinary office had stated that Strzok was to receive a demotion and
a 60-day suspension. This could be perceived as an "implied promise"
that he was not to be terminated because of this incident. Following
this determination, the Deputy Director terminated him anyway.

Additionally, Strzok had been a longtime agent and did not have many
disciplinary actions against him, which could also have produced what is
known as an "implied employment contract."

Therefore, there may be a case for a wrongful termination suit, but that
IG report is so damning and speaks volumes against what a seasoned agent
*should be* doing, that it appears that Strzok violated any implied
employment contracts that may have been present, and because of this,
it's unlikely that a wrongful termination suit would be successful.
