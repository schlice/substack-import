**Should "The Notorious RBG" (a.ka. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg) and her
anti-Trump bias be allowed to participate if The Schiff Show somehow
ends up at the Supreme Court?**

Ignoring the clear bias in your own question (you might think about
removing the plank from your own eye before you worry about the splinter
in your brother's eye), I'm curious how you think an impeachment will
end up at the Supreme Court.

Impeachment is a political process, not a legal one. The Supreme Court
has already determined that it has no role in impeachments as they are
purely political, not judicial. No one in the House or the Senate can
ask the courts to weigh in on the results of the impeachment, as it is
entirely up to the Congress to prosecute an impeachment.

There may be questions of law which rise to the level of the Supreme
Court; in Nixon's impeachment, there were questions about executive
privilege over his taped recordings of Oval Office conversations, and
that question regarding subpoenas *was* a legal question. But SCOTUS was
not involved with the *actual* impeachment or Senate trial in Nixon's
case; they addressed the narrow question of legality of the subpoenas
and whether or not the White House was obligated to produce the
information.

While the Supreme Court can judge specific legal questions, in this case
the Democrats in the House chose to ignore the courts and run the
impeachment on their own. They issued subpoenas, the White House exerted
executive privilege, and the House let it drop. They did not pursue the
subpoenas at all. They just ignored conducting a full and complete
investigation in favor of expediency.
