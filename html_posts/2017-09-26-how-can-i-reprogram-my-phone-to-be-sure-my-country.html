Let's start by assuming you're talking about your country *wiretapping*
your phone and listening to your calls and intercepting your text
messages. Since the listening would be taking place *outside* of your
physical device, there is nothing you can do to prevent your service
provider from listening in on your phone calls.

The only way you can prevent someone from listening in on your calls
while they are in flight is to use a secure phone.

There are many types of secure phones available. Militaries and
government agencies use them to communicate classified material over
regular telephone lines. The phones encrypt the voice on the source
side, send the encrypted voice to the target side, and decrypt the voice
on the target side. They exchange keys at the beginning of the call, and
once the two devices have sync'd, they begin encrypting the voice
traffic.

What you can do instead is use
[[Signal](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f74393&url=https://signal.org/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="signal.org"}]{.qlink_container}. Signal is an app for your
phone
([[Android](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c90720&url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id%3Dorg.thoughtcrime.securesms){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);" qt-tooltip="google.com"}
]{.qlink_container}or
[[iOS](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=df24a1&url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="apple.com"}]{.qlink_container}). So long as you and the
party you've called both are using Signal, calls and texts will be
end-to-end encrypted (from your handset to the called party's handset).
Best part: Signal is free and open-source. Signal doesn't integrate
tightly into iOS because of Apple restrictions, you have to use it as a
standalone app. But in Android, Signal integrates with Android, and if
the party you are calling also has Signal installed, it automatically
asks if you want the call to be secure. Text messages using the Messages
app works the same way.

If instead you were talking about your country hacking your phone and
enabling the microphone and camera to listen to you when you're not on
the phone, try this little piece of awesome:

[[**Anti-radiation Bag - Anti-tracking Pouch, EMF Protection for
Phone**](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e14a2d&url=https://www.amazon.com/Anti-radiation-Anti-tracking-Protection-Anti-spying-Function/dp/B074ZCHWGY/ref%3Dsr_1_2_sspa?ie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1506463495%26sr%3D8-2-spons%26keywords%3Dcell%2Bphone%2Bpouch%2Banti%2Bsignal%26psc%3D1){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}

The cool thing about this phone pouch is that once you slip it into that
pouch, no signals will get in or out. No one can hack your phone and
even if they did, they can't connect to your microphone or your camera,
and they won't be able to spy on you.

Of course, putting the phone in this pouch means that you won't get any
calls or texts, either. You would have to consciously take the phone
out, let it connect and update, and then when you're done, put it back.
Just know while the phone is in the pouch, you're out of touch too.
