**Do you think SCOTUS has dropped the ball on abortions?**

Not yet, but they'll have the opportunity to do so soon.

The only case they've decided so far has been *Box v. Planned Parenthood
of Indiana and Kentucky*. Many people saw it as the opportunity for the
high court to start weighing in on the constitutionality of *Roe v.
Wade*. They did not. Not yet, anyway.

They essentially declined to hear an appeal on a law banning abortions
for specific reasons (i.e. the baby is the wrong sex, or the baby has a
disability). This essentially means that the court is not expressing any
specific view about the constitutionality of such laws.

Also, there generally needs to be a split in the lower courts over the
constitutionality of such laws before they will step in and decide. In
this case, there was no such split.

The court did uphold part of that law, the one that requires abortion
providers to either bury or cremate fetal remains.

**So has SCOTUS dropped the ball? No, they took a hard pass.** They are
clearly leaving the revisitation of *Roe* for another day.
