**Muscular dystrophy** is a group of diseases that cause progressive
weakness and loss of muscle mass. In muscular dystrophy, abnormal genes
(mutations) interfere with the production of proteins needed to form
healthy muscle.

Certain genes are involved in making proteins that protect muscle fibers
from damage. Muscular dystrophy occurs when one of these genes is
defective. Each form of muscular dystrophy (there are several) is caused
by a *genetic mutation* particular to that type of the disease. Many of
these mutations are inherited. But some occur spontaneously in the
mother\'s egg or the developing embryo and can be passed on to the next
generation.[\[1\]](#rKeKZ){#cite-rKeKZ .citation_link}

**Multiple Sclerosis** is an autoimmune disease in which the body's
immune system attacks the myelin sheath surrounding nerve fibers within
the Central Nervous System (CNS). These areas of *demyelination* cause
decreased nerve signal transmission and thus cause the various symptoms
of MS. The most common symptoms are fatigue, visual issues, cognitive
issues, some movement disorder, and some bowel/bladder disorders.
