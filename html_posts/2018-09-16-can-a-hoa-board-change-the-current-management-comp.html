**Can a HOA Board change the current management company without first
informing or consulting with HOA members via an official HOA meeting?**

In most cases, yes.

Unless your Governing Documents require that management company changes
be voted on at an Annual Meeting by a quorum of homeowners, there is
generally no such requirement. The Board is free to change the
management company in accordance with the contract between the HOA and
the company itself. When the contract comes due, the Board can choose to
renew the contract, or select a new management company.

Presumably, the Board did their due diligence and shopped around to find
a good deal. If they didn't, maybe those Board members shouldn't be
re-elected when their terms are up, and maybe someone else with a little
more fiscal sense should be on the Board.

But generally, homeowners rail on about how terrible their Board is, but
never volunteer to serve on the Board themselves. Or they become
"single-issue" Board members ("I'm only here to get X rule overturned")
and they are ineffectual at every other time. So you have a small group
of dedicated Board members and it appears like an oligarchy or some sort
of back-room power thing, when in reality, it's nothing of the sort. I
never feared losing my high-paying job on the Board.

That's sarcasm. Board members are volunteers. They get nothing (but
ridicule) out of the deal.

Unless they're actually good. I've had too many residents from my last
neighborhood approach me and ask if I'm still on the Board. When I say
that I served out my two three-year terms and I'm done now, they ask if
I can go back. That's the surest indication to me that I did something
right.
