**Is it morally okay for a 23 year old male college student to date a 17
year old female college student given that she is above the age of
consent?**

We can't answer what's "morally" okay. Morals are derived from your
upbringing and perhaps your religion. Morals are not dictated by
society. Morals are yours. What's morally acceptable to you may not be
morally acceptable to me, and vice versa.

Legally, it's a different story. There are no laws about who can date
whom, regardless of age. There are indeed laws about sex, and they are
different in every state. Usually, the age of consent is 18 in the
United States. There may be a "close in age" law which means that you
have to be more than X years apart and one person below the age of
consent before statutory rape laws kick in, it really depends on the
state.
