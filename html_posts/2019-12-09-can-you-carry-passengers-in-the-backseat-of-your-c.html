**Can you carry passengers in the backseat of your car with a minor
learners permit (Colorado) provided that the person who signed your
affidavit of liability and guardianship is in the front seat with you?**

Short answer: no.

Longer answer: Colorado's Graduated Driver's License program states that
while you have your learner's permit only, you can only drive with a
drivers education instructor or any licensed adult over the age of 21.
The only exception is when you are actively participating in a driver's
education course with the driver's education instructor. Other students
similarly licensed may be passengers in the same instructional car.

The person who signed your DR2460 is the only person who can log the
required 50 hours of drive time. That person does not need to be the
licensed adult over 21 who accompanies the learner while they drive. The
presence or absence of this person does not change the rules about
passengers.

Only after the learner gets the actual license can they carry
passengers, and with the following restrictions:

- You are not allowed to carry a passenger under 21 who is not a family
  member until you have had your license for at least six months.
- You are not allowed to carry more than one passenger under 21 who is
  not a family member until you have held your license for at least one
  year.
- While you are under 18, you cannot drive between the hours of 12:00
  midnight and 5:00 a.m. unless you have held your license for at least
  one year.

So for the first six months, you can only carry passengers under 21 who
are family members. For the next six months, you can carry one passenger
under 21. Once you have had your license for one year, you can carry as
many passengers as there are seat belts.
