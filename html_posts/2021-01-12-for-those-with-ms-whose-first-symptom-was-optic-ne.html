**For those with MS, whose first symptom was optic neuritis: Did your
other symptoms mostly affect your vision, too, or were they of mixed
nature affecting your body in different ways?**

My first symptom was optic neuritis. At the time, you couldn't be
diagnosed with MS with just one symptom. The McDonald Criteria specified
"two different symptoms, affecting two different body systems,
disseminated by time and space" to be positively diagnosed with MS. But
my MRI was so definitive (he said it looked like Swiss cheese) that he
called it "probable MS." He said I should not wait, and should start an
MS therapy drug as soon as possible. He said, "the most 'conservative'
approach is to 'conserve' as much brain tissue as possible." The
downside: even if you are "probable MS," by starting the medication, you
are essentially claiming that you are "definite MS," even without the
official diagnosis. I took the "conservative" approach and started
Copaxone.

My second symptom wouldn't occur for at least five more years, probably
because I had started early on an MS therapy drug. At a routine annual
physical, my neurologist noted that I had weakness on the right side of
my body. Correlating this weakness to new lesions which appeared on my
MRI prompted me to change my medicine, since clearly it had stopped
working. I only stayed on that medicine (Tysabri) for about 18 months
due to the risk of PML, and then switched to Gilenya.

I've been on Gilenya for a little over five years, but I just switched
to Zeposia. Zeposia works pretty much the same way Gilenya does, except
that it targets fewer sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptors. Zeposia
binds with high affinity to only S1P receptors 1 and 5, and has little
affinity to the other S1P receptors. This means that it, in theory, is
safer and causes fewer side effects.
