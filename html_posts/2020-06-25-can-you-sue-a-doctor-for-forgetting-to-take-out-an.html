**Can you sue a doctor for forgetting to take out an ovary?**

How do you "forget" to take out an ovary???

The surgery was either scheduled to include ovary removal, or it was
not. If the doctor told you that it was optional, or only if the ovary
was damaged or non-functional, then leaving it in may have been the best
medical course of action.

But if, for example, you went in for a complete hysterectomy, to include
both ovaries, and the doctor just left one in with no medical
explanation as to why, then you may have a claim for malpractice. You'll
probably want to contact a medical malpractice attorney to find out if
you have a case.
