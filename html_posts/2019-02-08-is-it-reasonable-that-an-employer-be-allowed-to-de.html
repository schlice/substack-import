**Is it reasonable that an employer be allowed to decide what kind of
health insurance you have?**

Is it reasonable that the entity who is contributing the lion's share of
the money to pay for your health insurance determine exactly what
insurance they are willing to pay for and what insurance they are not
willing to pay for?

The Supreme Court actually heard a similar case when they decided
*Burwell v. Hobby Lobby* in 2014. They held that Hobby Lobby did not
have to pay for contraceptive coverage for their employees. Granted,
this decision was specific to *closely-held corporations*, and it was
specific to the Affordable Care Act's contraceptive mandate, and it was
also granted that there were less restrictive alternatives available
(and then later, a government-sponsored birth control alternative for
women who worked for corporations which did not want to purchase birth
control). But the idea is the same: *if I'm paying for it, then I get to
determine exactly what I am willing, and what I am not willing, to pay
for.*

To that end, and with that understanding, **yes** it is reasonable that
an employer be allowed to decide what kind of health insurance they will
offer to you. Health insurance is offered as a fringe benefit of
employment.

You are under no obligation to accept their health insurance, even if
you do work for them. You are also under no obligation to work there.
You are always free to find another job at another employer whose health
plans are more acceptable to you.
