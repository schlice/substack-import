**Since we can impeach Trump as many times as we want, should we keep on
impeaching him until the Senate gets tired of us doing that so they will
reluctantly vote to remove Trump from office just so they won\'t have to
continue having hearings?**

That's a great plan.

I guarantee that the public will never get tired of House Democrats
accomplishing nothing other than little token pieces of legislation
while they spend GOBS of taxpayer dollars and waste valuable time in an
endless string of impeachment investigations.

I guarantee that none of those "at-risk Democrats" (i.e. Democrats who
won in 2018 in areas that Trump carried) will be voted out of office in
2020.

It's a foolproof plan. What could go wrong?

/sarc

My sarcasm aside, Democrats are already seeing public opinion turning
against the impeachment we have now. Independents are turning against
impeachment as the weeks drag on. Even as impeachment is being debated
by the entire House today (Dec 18, 2019), some Democrats are poised to
vote against at least one Article of Impeachment. Another impeachment
charade is not expected to change public opinion; in fact, if the
current trend of opinions towards impeachment continues, further
impeachments will progressively get more unpopular, further galvanizing
support for the President against impeachment, as well as threatening
the seats of at-risk Democrats in the House, and at worst, swing the
House back to Republican leadership.
