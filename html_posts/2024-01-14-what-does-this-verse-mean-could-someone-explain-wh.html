I want to key you in to a really great reference. It's a website by the
makers of
[[GotQuestions.org](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e4ff7d&url=http://GotQuestions.org){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="gotquestions.org"}]{.qlink_container} called
[[BibleRef.com](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=167de6&url=https://www.bibleref.com){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}. You put in a verse and it
gives you a synopsis of that verse.

For example, when you enter [[Psalm
8:4](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=18e1ce&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Psalms/8/Psalm-8-4.html){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}, it says:

> When David scanned the night sky, he felt insignificant and wondered
> why such a magnificent Creator would care about man. The Hebrew for
> \"man\" in this verse is actually the term *enos*, subtly different
> from the term *ā\'dām* typically used to refer to mankind. *Enos*
> signifies the individual person, while \"the son of man\" refers to
> people in general. The emphasis here is on the individual human as a
> \"weak, mortal man.\"
>
> God has shown His care of humans in several ways. He created our first
> parents only after He had created a world that was ready for them. The
> sun, moon, and stars provided light for them, the plants were a food
> source, the climate was ideal for sustaining life, and Adam and Eve
> enjoyed their life together on a paradise. In addition to providing a
> suitable environment for humans, God showed His love and care by
> giving His Son as our Redeemer. [[John

> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
> qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container} emphasizes the extent of
> God\'s love for us by giving His only begotten Son so we would receive
> everlasting life by believing on Him.
>
> Also, God shows His care of us by providing our daily needs and by
> inviting us to talk to Him about all our concerns ([[Matthew
> 6:33](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=dc8321&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/6/Matthew-6-33.html){.external_link
> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
> qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}; [[Hebrews

And when you hit the right-arrow to move to [[Psalm
8:5](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e30a3e&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Psalms/8/Psalm-8-5.html){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}, it says:

> In this verse David reflects on God\'s creation of man. He views man
> as having been created a little lower than the heavenly beings, the
> angels. [[Hebrews
> 2:9](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=99c8c2&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/2/Hebrews-2-9.html){.external_link
> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
> qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container} applies [[Psalm
> 8:5](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e30a3e&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Psalms/8/Psalm-8-5.html){.external_link
> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
> qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container} to Jesus. Although He
> created the heavenly beings, Jesus chose to become a man in order to
> die in the place of sinful man. None of the angels could serve as our
> substitute and die in our place. Angels do not experience humanity,
> but Jesus did. Angels are not human, but Jesus lived as a man. Only by
> becoming human could He serve as a sacrifice for humanity ([[Hebrews
> 2:11](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a16b74&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/2/Hebrews-2-11.html){.external_link
> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"

>
> By willingly terminating His life on the cross Jesus paid the penalty
> for the sins of all who put their faith in Him, past, present, and
> future. On the cross, Jesus cried out, \"It is finished\" ([[John
> 19:30](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8e8d05&url=https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-30.html){.external_link
> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
> qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}). The Greek for this
> expression is *tetelestai*, meaning, \"it stands finished,\" or \"it
> is paid.\" Jesus\' substitutionary death was sufficient payment for
> all time for the sins of humanity. Our salvation could not be
> purchased for anything less than Jesus\' blood, and nothing more than
> His blood is required ([[1 Peter
> 1:18--19](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=be8e18&url=https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/1/1-Peter-1-18.html){.external_link

What an excellent exegetical resource for believers to use to reference!
I can't recommend it highly enough.
