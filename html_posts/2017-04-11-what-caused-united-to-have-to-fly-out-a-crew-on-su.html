Sometimes, inclement weather or mechanical problems cause a crew which
was scheduled to come off of one plane and board another to be delayed.
It happens. As I understand it, the crew that was supposed to take over
the flight in Louisville was delayed, and they did not have another
standby crew available.

It's not cost effective to station a standby crew in *every airport* to
bounce onto a flight to take over if a flight crew gets delayed. Often,
you will have to get the standby crew from where they *are* to where
they *need to be*. That usually involves putting them on another flight.

*When* this happens is not something that can be planned for. It's a
*contingency.*
