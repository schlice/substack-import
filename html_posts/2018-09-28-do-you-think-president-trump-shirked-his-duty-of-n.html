**Do you think President Trump shirked his duty of not ordering an FBI
investigation because of his own problems of sexual accusations?**

No, of course not.

The FBI already investigated Judge Kavanaugh **six times** and this
never came up.

An FBI investigation would include going back to his home town and
talking to his neighbors and friends. If this drug-and-rape ring was so
pervasive, it's improbable (nay impossible) that the FBI wouldn't have
found some evidence that it existed, and that he was a part of it.

But they found nothing.

Why would a seventh investigation find something new, from an
uncorroborated, unverified single witness statement, where everyone
claimed to be involved vehemently denied that it even occurred, let
alone that anyone including Judge Kavanaugh was involved?

What's more, what would an FBI investigation find that we don't already
know? The FBI doesn't find guilt or innocence, nor do they investigate
the veracity of any claims. They simply aggregate all of the available
information and present it back to the requester.

We already know that everyone she claimed was there denied being there.
The FBI isn't going to tell us anything we don't already know.

Trump actually performed his duty well by not wasting Federal resources
on an investigation that we know will produce nothing.
