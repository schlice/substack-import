**Do you think the impeachment inquiry, started on Sept. 24th 2019, into
President Donald Trump will hurt the Democratic nominee for the 2020
Presidential election? Why or why not?**

It might *influence who becomes the Democratic nominee*.

If Republicans can stretch out the impeachment hearings in the Senate,
the Senators who are currently running for President have pledged to
remain there during the proceedings.

That's good news for Joe Biden, who can essentially run unopposed by his
biggest competition (Sanders, Warren, etc).
