Faith is never blind. Blind faith is foolish. Faith is not "belief
without evidence." Faith is believing what you *know* to be true. Faith
is "*belief* *in what the evidence is showing you*."

We know Christianity is true through the evidence of its truth: the
Bible. And we know the Bible is true because of:

- **prophesy**. The Bible is filled with prophesies about "God becoming
  man." And those prophesies detailed all kinds of things: how he would
  be conceived, how he would be born, how he wold live, how he would be
  captured and persecuted and killed, and that he would rise from the
  dead. Remember that it is a prophesy because it was written hundreds
  to thousands of years before it happened. And then it happened. And as
  evidence that it happened, we have:
- **testimony**. We have eyewitness testimony, people who were present
  and saw the very things that were prophesied. These eyewitnesses
  recorded, and then proclaimed, what they saw. They were physically
  subjected to torture and death for saying the things they said, which
  they could have spared themselves by simply being quiet. So we know
  that their testimony, in the face of certain death, was true. In other
  words, we know the testimony was **authentic,** or "uninvented."
- **miracles**. Miracles were performed, and were witnessed by people
  who personally recorded their existence. These miracles were not only
  prophesied, but were recorded in the Bible by people who personally
  witnessed them.
- **outside references**. There are other references outside the Bible
  which verify the authenticity of the bible. Ancient historians
  recorded the same events in their writings as are recorded in the
  Bible, proving the accuracy of the Biblical accounts.

Why would the Bible writers lie? What would they get out of it? Because
what they got out of telling the stories they did was rejection,
misunderstanding, persecution, torture, and death. Hardly a compelling
reason to lie.

There are many more details which show us that the Bible writers were
authentic, and were telling the truth, but it's probably too detailed to
include here. But we know that all of these things happened.

Therefore, if we believe that the Bible accounts are true, and the Bible
speaks of God and Jesus and the path to salvation, we should clearly
believe that it is true.
