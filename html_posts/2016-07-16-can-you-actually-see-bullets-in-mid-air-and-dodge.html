Short answer: no.

Longer answer: Mythbusters "sort of" tested this. They tested whether or
not you could dodge a bullet if you were a sufficient distance away from
the shooter and could see the muzzle flash. With the help of a US Army
sniper, they tested the theory. They found that using standard loads,
you simply couldn't see the muzzle flash outside of 200 yards away. A
sniper round traveled 200 yards in 231 milliseconds.

So they set up a test. They used a sniper rifle loaded with blanks set
up 200 yards away, and set up a paintball gun at roughly point-blank
range (i.e. within about 4 feet of the target) and wired its firing
mechanism so that it would fire a paintball 231 ms after the sniper
rifle was fired, and neither Adam or Jamie came close to being able to
dodge the bullet, even when they could see the muzzle flash.

The only way they could dodge a bullet was when they switched to
Hollywood blanks which make very large muzzle flashes and moved the
rifle out to 500 yards. It takes a bullet 597 milliseconds to travel
that distance, and with the rig set to 597, they were finally able to
start dodging bullets.

But since they had to use Hollywood blanks, be ready and staring
directly at the shooter and even then they just barely got out of the
way, they declared the myth busted.[\[1\]](#iSkXF){#cite-iSkXF

I would tend to agree. Even with a perfect set of circumstances, in the
real world it would be virtually impossible to dodge a bullet. And being
able to see a bullet mid-air means it has already traversed some of the
distance between the shooter and you, so you are **extremely** unlikely
to be able to dodge the bullet at that point.
