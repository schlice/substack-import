Jones was shot accidentally while the officer was acting in
self-defense, so his use of force was lawful. In order to be criminally
charged, there must be an ***unlawful*** taking of life. Shooting in
self-defense is still unlawful, but has an affirmative defense, so it is
not charged. The fact that the victim was an innocent bystander does not
change the lawful nature of the original use of force. The State\'s
Attorney\'s Office said they \"concluded that there is insufficient
evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Officer \[Robert\]
Rialmo did not act in self-defense in shooting LeGrier and Jones.\"

The Cook County Sheriff's Office is still investigating the officer's
actions, and whether or not he may have violated department policy is
still being reviewed. In any case, violating department policy or not
would have no bearing on whether or not he would be held criminally
liable for the death.

This also does not mean that the family cannot pursue civil charges
against the officer for wrongful death. In this case, the department's
review of the shooting would be important, because it would establish
whether or not the officer acted recklessly or not in keeping with
department policy on the use of force.

The tenor of your comments implies that the same standards do not hold
true when it comes to shooting in self-defense between police and
civilians. While I can see how you can easily misunderstand what has
happened here, the standards for self-defense apply equally to everyone.
The officer was not subject to any different standards than any member
of the public facing a similar deadly-force situation would have been
subject to.
