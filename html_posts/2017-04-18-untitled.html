I know things seem "clear" to you from watching cell phone video. But
this is the danger of the body worn camera and the cell phone video
which you so wholeheartedly believe in.

Did you see how much the man was resisting arrest? No? Did you see any
of the altercation before the video started rolling? No? Do you have the
legal authorization to pass judgment on how much force is actually
allowed when effecting an arrest of an actively resisting suspect? No?
Do you know **how many times** this man was asked to follow crewmember
instructions and then was told to follow police instructions and he
**actively refused?** Actively refused means "resisted arrest."

Don't forget that this man is not a "victim." He is a "volunteer." He
volunteered to be assaulted by police when he actively refused to follow
law enforcement officer instructions and Federal law, and **assaulted a
cop**. You didn't know he hit the cop? No? Oh, I guess your cell phone
video angle must have missed that part.

I also don't know where you get the line that police officers are
required to take all reasonable steps to protect the subject they are
arresting. Can you detail the law you are quoting? When a suspect is
actively resisting, police are actually authorized to use one level of
force greater than the force being presented to them in order to bring
the suspect into compliance, lest others around the actively resisting
suspect be injured or (God forbid) killed.

Nice try though, your bias is showing.
