**How can you stop tremors from MS happening?**

(NOTE: I originally wrote an answer about tremors and spasticity. While
the conditions are similar, I decided to re-focus my answer on tremors
only).

"Tremor" in MS is the involuntary shaking of muscles. Tremor can affect
arms and legs, head, body, or the muscles needed for sexual function.

There are two basic types of tremor:

- Gross tremor, or wide back-and-forth movement of muscles, usually in
  the arms and legs
- Intention tremor, or action tremor, occurs usually when a person
  reaches for something.

Severe tremor can interfere with daily function such as speaking,
writing, walking, or eating.

Tremor is primarily treated using occupational therapy. If tremor
affects speech, a Speech and Language Pathologist (SLP), or a speech
therapist, can help with techniques to make speech clearer.

There is a whole host of medications which can be used to treat tremor:

- Hydroxyzine (Atarax, Vistaril®) Antihistamine that can help minor
  tremor worsened by stress
- Clonazepam (Klonopin®) Anti-anxiety agent with sedative effect
- Propranolol (Inderal®) Beta-blocker with modest relief for some tremor
- Buspirone (Buspar®) Anti-anxiety agent with some antitremor effect
- Ondansetron (Zofran®) Anti-nausea medication with anti-tremor effect,
  but very expensive
- Primidone (Mysoline®) Anti-epileptic medication with some antitremor
  effect in low doses; sedating effect
- Acetazolamide (Diamox) Diuretic; some help for postural tremor
- OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox®) Neurotoxin that temporarily paralyzes
  targeted muscles; may be effective for tremor in the arms and hands

Other medications that may be tried include gabapentin (Neurontin®),
isoniazid (Laniazid, in the US; Isotamine in Canada); and
trihexyphenidyl (Artane). Some gross tremor can also be treated with
baclofen, which is primarily an agent for treating spasticity.

More invasive treatment may include deep brain stimulation, which was
originally developed to treat tremor in Parkinson's patients.

Bottom line: if you are experiencing MS tremor, see your neurologist. He
or she can assist you with the appropriate referrals to specialists,
help you start on occupational therapy or help get you started on some
trial medications to see if it can help. MS tremor is treatable and we
can manage the symptoms. It will take time, and it's not easy to find
the exact right strategy every time. Keep trying until you hit the sweet
spot. The resources are available; don't give up.
