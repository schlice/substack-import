**If, as claimed by most gun rights' supporters, guns are not the cause
of the unspeakable murders of schoolchildren and others during school
shooting rampages, can we at least agree that it's the easy access to
guns that is the principal reason?**

It's not even a *tangential* reason.

Guns make the act of killing more precise and easier. They don't make
killing possible. A true killer will find another way if he can't get
his hands on a gun.
