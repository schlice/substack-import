Highly unlikely.

Being saved doesn't change your human nature. The sins we commit, in
thought and in word, in our actions, and in our *inactions*, are tied
directly to the fact that we are human and fallible.

Sure, you will be *better* after you are saved. You'll think
differently. You'll act differently. You'll be in the word more. You'll
praise God more. You'll be able to more easily talk to God about your
sin and seek repentance.

But will you be completely free of sin? Highly unlikely.
