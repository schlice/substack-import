**Looking for that middle ground: If you are a supporter of President
Trump, what is one thing he has done you disagree with? If you do not
endorse President Trump, what is one thing he has done that you
support?**

I love the President because he has done exactly what he said he was
going to do. He did exactly what he was elected to do, and it's working.

***I seriously wish he would stop using Twitter unsupervised.***

I mean, I get it. He's from New York, so I understand the attitude. I
get it. I'm from New York too.

But for God's sake, please stop with the Twitter.

He doesn't need to be a better, more eloquent speaker. He just needs to
speak *less*. Let actions speak where words fail.

*If you're interested in discussing Trump's Twitter usage, feel free to
comment. But I'm not debating you on anything else. I'm not going to
debate whether or not you think Trump has done anything good (or
anything useful at all) during his presidency to date. Start telling me
how he hasn't really done anything, or trying to make me prove what he's
done, and your comment gets deleted. I'm totally not interested in
arguing about what you think he's done right or wrong, unless you have a
comment about Trump's Twitter usage.*
