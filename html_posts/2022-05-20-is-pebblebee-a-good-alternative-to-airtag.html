It seems to be.

One of its best features: the batteries are rechargeable. Additionally,
the Pebblebee Clip (the one that mimics the small puck-sized AirTag) has
its own built-in carry loop, unlike Apple's version which requires a
third party accessory.

Prices are on par with AirTags, and they work seamlessly with Apple's
Find My network, so they're a solid competitor to AirTags.

Both the single Clip and Card sell for \$29.99, and you can get a 4-pack
of Clips for \$99.99. Currently they are only for sale [[on the
company's
website](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=57bad6&url=https://pebblebee.com/collections/all-products){.external_link

selling on Amazon too.
