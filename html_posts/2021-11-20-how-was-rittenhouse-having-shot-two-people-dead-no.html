Great answers here, but two things haven't really been said yet:

1.  An "active shooter" is someone who is just walking around,
    indiscriminately shooting people with no provocation. Just waltzing
    up to someone and popping them in the head. ***THAT*** is an active
    shooter. Rittenhouse was on the ground, being kicked and hit in the
    head with a skateboard, *THEN* he fired. That simply doesn't fit the
    definition of an active shooter.
2.  If you are going to use a firearm (especially when you do not have
    the legal authority to possess one) to "defend others," you had
    better make **DAMN SURE** that those others are actually not the
    aggressors. Remember, you are making the decision, on the street,
    that would normally be reserved for a judge and jury. But you're
    trying to make it. You're trying to determine who is the aggressor
    and who is the victim, **AND THEN** you are seeking to use deadly
    force against the one you have chosen is the aggressor.\
    \
    Choose wisely, you only get one chance, and your choice will haunt
    you for the rest of your life.\
    \
    Huh. Maybe you should leave that choice to the people with the
    qualified immunity.\
    \
    Or, hear me out, **only use deadly force on someone when your own
    life is threatened!**

You're not a cop! It's not your job to "defend others." Your firearm is
for **YOUR PROTECTION! NOT THEIRS!** If they wanted to be protected,
they should have gone through the process to get their own carry permit
and their own gun! I'll say it again (and probably a few more times
too), it's not your job to go out and defend others!

Kyle Rittenhouse wasn't out there using his gun to defend others. He was
defending property against looters. He got called away to provide
medical assistance, and he was attacked. He fired in self-defense. The
jury agreed that this is what happened. The video evidence from
throughout the day supports this.

When you get a concealed carry permit, the purpose is to protect
yourself and your family. The purpose is not to become a vigilante. You
are not "deputized." It would have to be an absolutely stupid blatant
active shooter before I draw my firearm against him. Like someone just
spinning around in a circle shooting anything that moved. And even then,
I'd attract his attention first and allow him the opportunity to point
his gun at me (yeah, reckless, I know) before I fired. But I'd have the
double protection of using my firearm to protect others AND using my
firearm to protect myself. That's about the only time I'd ever shoot
someone who was not directly threatening me.

Otherwise, ***I'D*** be in the defendant's chair instead of Rittenhouse.
