**If Republicans have nothing to hide, then why is the Senate afraid to
have witnesses and why suddenly start a war out of nowhere?**

Let's break this down by the two questions you posed:

> **why is the Senate afraid to have witnesses**

The Senate is not *afraid* to have witnesses. The Senate is not
*required* to have witnesses. It's not a matter of being afraid to hear
them. It's a matter of scope creep. It's not their job.

The House did the investigation, it's over. The House Democrats found
there was enough evidence to impeach the President. The time for
investigation is complete. The House was presumably as thorough as it
could have been (we'll leave that point open for debate). However, the
fact that they voted on Articles of Impeachment implies that they have
completed their investigation to their satisfaction and have voted.
Since the House has the **sole** power to impeach, that they have done
so is no longer in question.

The Senate has the **sole** power to hold a trial to determine whether
or not the impeached person should be removed from office. The Senate
**is not re-litigating the impeachment**. The impeachment has been done.
It's the Senate's job to determine if the impeachment, ***as presented
and passed by the House***, is sufficient to remove the person from
office. That's it. It's not time to dig for new evidence, or hear from
new witnesses, because that's not the Senate's job. If 67 Senators
believe the impeachment, ***as presented and passed by the House***, is
sufficient to remove the President from office, then they will vote to
do so. If they believe they need to hear from the witnesses who were
already called in the House, they can, in order to make their
determination as to whether or not the President should be removed from
office. They don't have to; the House has already interviewed them, and
all of the evidence they should need is contained in the Articles of
Impeachment.

> **and why suddenly start a war out of nowhere?**

So it's clear from your question that you haven't been following the
situation in the Middle East. Soleimani was a ***terrorist***. He has
already directly ordered the killings of ***over 600 American
citizens***. He was in Iraq because he loves the scenery; he was just a
person on vacation. LOL JK he was there directing more attacks against
US forces.

In other words, ***he was a target of opportunity.***

We had the opportunity to kill a terrorist, and we did. He was a
High-Value Target (HVT), and we capture or kill HVTs. We had an
opportunity to kill him, and we took it.

We're most definitely not *starting* a war. We took steps to *prevent* a
war.

Killing Soleimani sends a message to any other terrorist inside or
outside of Iran: prosecute terror attacks against US citizens, and die
horribly by drone strike when you least expect it.

Iran's not stupid enough to go to war with us. I mean, their government
is corrupt and they'll just as soon risk their peoples' lives by
provoking the US as they will wake up in the morning. But they aren't
stupid enough to provoke the US into aggression. Which is why, after
some paltry retaliatory strike to appease the radicals in their state,
they emphatically stated that they won't progress any further. They
threw a couple of missiles at us to show their people that they did
something to avenge Soleimani's death, and that's it.

But we should also be aware that they won't stop there. And they should
be warned that if they kill Americans, there will be a price to pay.
