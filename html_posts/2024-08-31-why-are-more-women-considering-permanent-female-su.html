Because despite what they will openly tell you, the pro-choice movement
is about babies, not about women.

***The pro-choice movement isn't about choosing when a woman is pregnant
or not. It's about never producing unwanted babies.***

And I can prove it.

The solution to the abortion debate is viability, and the solution to
viability is science. [[**Artificial

They are already being tested and the science is making great progress.
So instead of killing the baby (which is the entire *raison d\'Ãªtre* of
the pro-life movement), you can transfer the baby to an artificial womb,
which "terminates the pregnancy." That is, the woman is no longer
pregnant.

Isn't that the goal?

Not if you listen to the supposed "smart people" on the ethics of the
situation.

But waitaminute, I thought that removing the baby from the mother *was*
terminating the pregnancy. But you can see what Ravitsky says here: the
comparison is either put the baby in an artificial womb, saving the
baby; or "terminate the pregnancy," which means that the definition of
"terminate the pregnancy" is the opposite of "save the baby".

In case you think that I'm misinterpreting what she said, she then
doubles down, saying that "\[Artificial wombs are\] a new way of taking
away abortion rights."

So what she's saying here is that "abortion rights" means *the right to
"terminate your pregnancy,"* which she has already defined as the
opposite of whatever happens when you put your baby in an artificial
womb. In other words, you kill your baby.

She would rather kill the baby than let it grow *completely independent
of her* and go on to have its own life. She's arguing that "terminating
the pregnancy" and "abortion rights" means the right to kill the baby.

\

What's happening here is that some in the pro-choice movement still
falsely believe that *if you can't kill your baby, you must* ***raise***
*it.* And this is completely untrue. Ravitsky, along with many others in
the pro-choice camp, still falsely believe that **the government wants
to force you to become a mother**, and that is simply completely untrue.
How do I know? There are Safe Haven laws in **every state in the
country.** You can usually walk out of the hospital after you give birth
and not take your baby, no questions asked. Or you could take your baby,
walk across the street to the fire station, and give it up, no questions
asked. *Every state in the country allows you to do this.* Why do
pro-choice people still believe that the government is desiring to force
you to keep your baby?

They're not.

They simply don't want you to **kill** your baby. In other words, you
don't have to **keep** your baby, but you really shouldn't have to
**kill** your baby. It's that simple. It's a *human rights* issue, and
the baby is most definitely scientifically human from the moment of
conception. We know it's human because it has two human parents and it
is producing human enzymes, not carrot or frog enzymes. And we know it's
alive because it is growing and consuming energy. And we believe that
all living humans have the equal right to life, regardless of what stage
of life they are in.

Of course, we acknowledge that women have the right to bodily autonomy,
and that right is important. But we simply believe that in this
particular conflict of rights, the right to bodily autonomy of the
mother does not outweigh the right to life of the baby.

Those in the pro-choice camp also place ***differential value on life
depending on its temporal locality*** (basically, its position in space
and time). Basically, if it's less than nine months old and it is living
in a uterus, its life has less value than after it is nine months old
and not living in a uterus. Alongside this temporal locality value of
life, they also believe that the life only has value insofar as it is
*wanted*. The reasoning they employ goes thusly:

*What if the baby has a birth defect? Who will adopt that baby? No one
will choose to adopt that baby, so it will go into the foster care
system, which is a hard life for a baby. Why would we willingly create
children who could end up in the foster care system?*

\

When you apply this understanding to the statement that more women are
turning to sterilization following the overturning of *Roe v. Wade*,
then it makes complete sense. If I am pro-choice, and the goal of the
pro-choice movement is actually to have the freedom to kill a baby for
whatever reason, and the state won't allow me to do that, then I simply
can't get pregnant, ever.
