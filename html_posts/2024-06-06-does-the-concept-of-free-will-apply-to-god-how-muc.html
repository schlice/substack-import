No, the concept simply doesn't apply to God, if we assume that God is
*omnipotent* and *eternal*.

The idea of free will is the idea that we have choices at the moment of
decision. This implies that there is a time *before* you make a choice,
then you make a choice, and then there is a time *after* you made that
choice wherein something is different.

This does not apply to God, for two primary reasons.

First, God is not subject to time. He doesn't operate in time like
everyone else does. He is *outside* of time. For God, everything is
*now*. The past is *now*. The present is *now*. The future is *now*. He
sees it all because He does not exist in time as we do.

If God is not subject to time, then there is no "before" or "after" for
God; there is only *now*.

Second, God is *omnipotent*, lacking nothing. The ability to make a
choice implies that God's knowledge was somehow *incomplete* "before"
the choice was made, and then God learned something new and He made a
different decision "after" the choice was made. God's knowledge is
complete, lacking nothing. He cannot *not know* something and then
"change His mind" after learning something new.
