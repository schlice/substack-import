**In the US, how would you ask a court to invalidate a state of
emergency that was illegitimate?**

Short answer: you can't, unless the president violated the National
Emergencies Act

Longer answer: The judicial branch does not decide political questions.
National emergencies are governed by the National Emergencies Act.
Congress has given the President 136 distinct, statutory emergency
powers, and has written special powers into 470 different Federal laws
which the president can activate via the declaration of a national
emergency. Congress has already provided this authority to the
President, and has given him wide latitude to use that authority to
protect the country in the way in which he sees fit.

To that end, if the President follows the National Emergencies Act and
declares a national emergency in accordance with it, he can then invoke
those emergency powers which have already been written into the law.

The President also has the authority to declare other emergencies, such
as "public health emergencies" under the Public Health Service Act, and
he can declare areas of "natural disaster" under the Stafford Act.

Unless you claim that the President failed to follow the provisions of
the National Emergencies Act, then it's unlikely that you can make the
statement that the president's determination of a national emergency is
"illegitimate."

You ***can*** claim that the President used his legal authority in a way
in which it was not intended. While his actions may not be "unlawful"
*per se*, they may constitute an **abuse of power**. The Constitutional
remedy for a President who abuses his office, abuses presidential power,
or abuses authority, is **impeachment**. The courts do not intercede in
political matters. The courts decide matters of law, and it appears that
what you're claiming here is that the President, while acting lawfully,
abused his authority. That is an area for Congress to address, not the
Courts.
