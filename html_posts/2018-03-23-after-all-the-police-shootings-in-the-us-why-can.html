**After all the police shootings in the US, why can\'t you sue officers
for murder?**

First of all, you can't sue for murder. Murder is a criminal charge. The
state prosecutes for murder. If the officer was not found guilty of
murder (which is the unlawful taking of a life with malice and
forethought), then the officer is not arrested and does not go to jail.

You (as a victim's family) can sue for what is known as "wrongful
death." This is a civil charge. In order to sue for wrongful death, the
following elements must be present:

> - The death of a human being;
> - Caused by another\'s negligence, or with intent to cause harm;
> - The survival of family members who are suffering monetary injury as
>   a result of the death, and;
> - The appointment of a personal representative for the decedent\'s
>   estate.
>
> A wrongful death claim may arise out of a number of circumstances,
> such as in the following situations:
>
> - Medical malpractice that results in decedent\'s death;
> - Automobile or airplane accident;
> - Occupational exposure to hazardous conditions or substances;
> - Criminal behavior;
> - Death during a supervised activity.[\[1\]](#xiBST){#cite-xiBST

Generally, it is only the victim's family who has standing to sue for
wrongful death (or the personal representative of the victim's estate).
