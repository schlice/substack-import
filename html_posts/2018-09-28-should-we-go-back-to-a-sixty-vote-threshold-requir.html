**Should we go back to a sixty vote threshold requirement for Supreme
Court Justices?**

We should go back to a 60 vote threshold for all Federal post nominees.

But not yet.

We're at a point in history where liberals have decided that they don't
have to accept half a loaf on legislation when they can press the issue
through the courts and get the whole loaf. Conservatives have similarly
realized that two can play at that game, and are trying to stack the
court. This is why the Kavanaugh fight is so pivotal over a SCOTUS seat
which should not be as powerful as it is.

When the legislature can get back to working together to pass
legislation that neither of them likes very much but actually reaches
***compromise***, then we can talk about raising the nomination
threshold back to 60 votes.

But in today's political climate, where Congress has shirked its
responsibilities and has asked the President and the courts to take over
where they should have reached compromise, we'd never get any nominees
confirmed at 60 votes.

We have to fix the underlying problem first.
