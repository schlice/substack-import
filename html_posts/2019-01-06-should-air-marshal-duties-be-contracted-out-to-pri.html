**Should Air Marshal duties be contracted out to private industry?**

Should they? That's a budgetary and policy decision for the TSA to make.
Whether or not they should is determined by whether or not doing so
makes fiscal sense, and whether or not a contract security company can
provide similar results to government agents.
