**Content:** [There is a great deal of forensic evidence that is
processed even when a shooter takes his/her own life. For example, the
officer\'s gun is taken at the scene and is placed into evidence, along
with the shooter\'s gun. The officer would have to take the suspect\'s
gun, in the suspect\'s hand, and point the gun at the suspect and
discharge the gun, in order to attempt to fool the forensics.\
\
But as the other answerers said, this is very common. Most \"active
shooters\" go into their spree knowing that they are likely not coming
out alive on the other end. They\'re going down in a blaze of glory, and
they\'re taking a few of their closest enemies with
them.]{.rendered_qtext}
