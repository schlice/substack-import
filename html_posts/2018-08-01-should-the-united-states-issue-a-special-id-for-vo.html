**Should the United States issue a special ID for voting in state and
federal elections?**

I have never voted in a federal election. I don't know what that looks
like.

I only vote in state elections.

I already have a state ID card (it happens to be my driver's license,
but it also functions as a state ID card). But it's not required to
vote.

I think that's a little odd. Every other government assistance program
in existence requires some form of identification, but somehow voting
does not?

But whatever. That's an answer for a question you didn't ask.

The only issue I should address, since there is no such thing as a
federal election, is **Should the United States issue a special ID for
voting in state elections?**

And the answer to that is a resounding **no**. The federal government
has no business issuing ID cards for states to hold state elections.
That's a state function. States already issue ID cards which can
effectively be used in state elections, and even if you don't drive a
car, you can get a low-cost or no-cost ID card from the state. Instances
where someone does not have the requisite documentation or can't afford
a state ID card are very, very rare. Even for the elderly, who maybe
don't possess the documentation required to get an ID card, there are
methods by which they can still get a card. For example, if they have
children who have them listed on their own birth certificates as the
"parent," this, along with a written affidavit, is sometimes all that is
needed to get a state ID card to allow for voting.
