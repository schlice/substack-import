Morality is not *dependent* on religion.

But one must ask themselves: *from where is the source of that
morality?*

In order to have a common, shared morality, there must be a
morals-giver. Remember, even babies have inborn morals.

But it doesn't make sense that this is an *evolved* trait. It is
antithetical to "survival of the fittest." Morals don't make me survive
better. Morals don't improve my chance for survival.

And even if you argue that morality is evolved, the Law of Causality
says that an effect must resemble its cause. It is therefore illogical
that a meaningless, purposeless, amoral universe can imbue us with
morals, and a sense of meaning and purpose.

Therefore, if the universe is not the source of our morality, there must
be another cause. And the only other logical choice is that some moral
being (you must have morals to give morals) imbued us with morals.

Atheists can't explain this at all. Agnostics say that they don't know
how to explain this. It could be a creator, but they just don't know.

Original question:

Can atheists be moral people? What about agnostics?
