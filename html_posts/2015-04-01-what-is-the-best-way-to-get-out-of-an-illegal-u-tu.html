**Content:** [According to your research, there had to be a curve or the
crest of a hill within 500 feet of where you made the U-turn in order
for it to be illegal, or it would have had to be clearly marked as a
\"No U-Turn\" area. The Ohio law makes it illegal to do a U-turn within
500 feet of a curve or the crest of a hill, such that you\'re not
clearly visible for 500 feet from where you make your U-turn.\
\
Go back to the place where you did the U-turn and measure the distance
from that spot, in both directions, to the nearest crest of a hill which
obstructs driver view, or the nearest blind curve (one you can\'t see
around). Take pictures from the spot of the U-turn in both directions.\
\
Then bring those to court, and argue that the U-turn didn\'t violate the
500 foot rule, and there are no signs visible to the driver in that area
that say \"No U-Turn\". Your pictures will support that assertion.\
\
If, perchance, there is a blind curve or the crest of a hill within 500
feet of where you made the U-turn, or there is a \"No U-Turn\" sign
there, I\'d suggest you follow Officer[

advice and see if you can get the local prosecutor to allow you to plead
guilty to a general equipment violation. Make sure they understand that
you\'re trying to keep the points off of your license for insurance
reasons. You will pay a higher fine, but you won\'t get any points, and
insurance will stay nice and tidy.]{.rendered_qtext}
