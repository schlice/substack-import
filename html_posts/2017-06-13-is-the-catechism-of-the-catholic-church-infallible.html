The catechism is infallible insofar as it is interpreted by the Pope in
whatever form he chooses to do that. Once the Pope interprets the
catechism (or re-interprets it), it is infallible.

That said, the catechism of the church has indeed changed, most notably
during the
[[Counter-Reformation](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cbd059&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Reformation){.external_link

the Reformation and the schism between Catholic and Protestant religions
through Martin Luther's 95 Theses.

During the Counter-Reformation, some practices were upheld
(transubstantiation, salvation through grace *and* works, etc), and some
were changed (Mass from Latin to English, priest with his back to the
congregation to facing front, some formerly apocryphal books of the
Bible were added, the adoption of the Nycene Creed, etc).
