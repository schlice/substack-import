I was waiting for [[Rick
Bruno](https://www.quora.com/profile/Rick-Bruno-1)]{.qlink_container} to
answer this, but I will answer from what I know.

I was not a K9 handler, but I often participated as a \"chew toy\" for
the K9s. I\'m a dog person; I love dogs, so when they asked the other
guys on the shift if anyone wanted to \"play\" with the dog, I totally
volunteered.

From my experience, the dog bites hard, but the thing that really
\"strikes\" you is the **force** with which the dog hits. Doesn\'t
matter how fast you can run, the dog is faster. Doesn\'t matter how big
you are, the force of that initial hit will knock you off your feet.
I\'ve tried it both ways: running, and feet firmly planted. Dog kicked
my butt.

And most importantly (and answering your question), the dog will
continue to attack until the officer gives the command to stop, and the
dog will stop instantly. Dogs do not understand the nuances of
\"surrender,\" nor should they have to. It\'s up to the K9 officer to
control the dog and \"release\" the dog when the suspect is no longer
deemed a threat.

So to answer your question, the dog will attack when it receives its
attack command, and it will continue attacking until it gets its release
command. The dog doesn\'t take cues from the suspect, it takes cues from
its handler.
