**Content:** [I think the best way to answer this is that the source of
both of these is different.\
\
Rights, as stated by Jefferson, are \"inalienable\" because they were
endowed by our Creator. They are inalienable, which means they can never
be revoked by anyone. Because we live in a society in which the rights
of others also have to be respected, our rights can be curtailed or
limited, but never revoked.\
\
Privileges are granted by governments or other organizations. Because
privileges are not inalienable, they can be revoked. For example,
driving a car is a privilege.]{.rendered_qtext}
