**Is the Samsung S Pen compatible with any tablet?**

No.

The S Pen is an *inductive stylus*, and it works with an active
digitizer which induces an electromagnetic field from underneath the
screen of a Samsung Note phone (or Ultra series phone, or Samsung
tablet). When the S Pen moves close to that active digitizer, the
electromagnetic field in the digitizer induces a current in the pen, and
they begin communicating with each other, even before the pen touches
the display. That's part of the beauty of the system, and how it can
work so well.

Non-S Pen tablets and phones use a *capacitive touch display.* Your
finger (and a regular stylus) is an electrostatic conductor. The hard
outer glass on your phone is also an electrostatic conductor. When you
touch the glass (either with your finger or a normal stylus), the
electrostatic field changes, and your phone registers that change as a
touch, a tap, or a drag.

An inductive stylus only marginally change the capacitance of the
screen, just enough to register the touch. The magic happens through
communications, not capacitance.
