Assuming that tax breaks which ***ONLY*** affect the top tax brackets or
***ONLY*** *the largest of* corporations actually existed, they would
still benefit the citizens of the country.

How? ***Innovation.***

You only have a cell phone in your pocket because rich people bought
very expensive ones back in the late 80s and early 90s.

You only have a flat-screen TV in your house for under \$500 because
some rich person bought the first plasma TV at \$14,995 in 1997.

Without those first few capital investments, there would be no market
for those devices. That infusion of capital, that recognition of the
market for the technology, spurred the R&D necessary to make the devices
smaller and more efficient, taking the phone from the car phone to the
DynaTAC bag phone, and into the phones you have today.

So yes, some rich person needs to buy that technology first so that you
and I can enjoy better, smaller, and cheaper versions of the same tech
later.
