How has MS changed me for the worse? Well, let's see. I lost my
commission in the Air Force and am now a disabled veteran. That's not
necessarily a bad thing on its own, except that I "wasn't done." I
wasn't ready to be done serving (and I'm still not). After I started my
injectable MS medication, I developed depression, which made me a very
bitter and angry person. I started on the "side-effect shuffle" where I
took one medication which came with a side effect, and I took a second
medication or supplement to treat that side effect, and it came with its
own side effect, etc. At one point, I was swallowing upwards of nine
pills a day, which didn't do anything to help my depression.

The damage from doing all of that was profound and affected me more than
the MS did, which just fed my depression.

It took me more than ten years to realize that Western medicine's plan
wasn't working when it came to my *overall* health, as opposed to the
treatment of my MS. My MS was well-controlled, but my overall health
suffered. I will always be grateful that my MS drugs were there when I
was diagnosed, as I firmly believe that the amount of disability I have
(which is currently very small) is due in large part to the fact that I
started MS drugs within six months of my diagnosis, and that was 13
years ago. After developing a nasty kidney stone from at least one, if
not two, of those pills in that picture working together to do me in, I
knew I needed a change. I added a naturalist doctor to my care team, and
with his help, we swept all of those pills away (with the exception of
the Gilenya, my MS medicine, the white/yellow capsule in the lower
right), and we are undoing all of the damage which was done over the
last 10 years and beyond. It's a slow process (I took nearly 20 years to
get there, I could give him at least a year to undo the damage done,
right?) but we are making progress, and it is visible and it is very,
very encouraging.

So has MS changed me for the better? After going through everything I
went through to get here, I can say that now, even with MS, I'm in
better health than I was even before I developed the disease. Going
through depression forced me to deal with some deep-seated issues in my
life that I hadn't dealt with up to that point, and I feel like I'm a
better man now because of it. My pride and my arrogance was getting in
the way of my personal growth. It's just too bad that it took MS and
depression to move past those. I'm now realizing all that I *can* do
with MS and I'm working around the things that I struggle with. I'm
closer to my family, and I believe I am happier, too. I'm finally coming
to grips with, and feeling more content with, the changes in my life.
That will become very important in being able to effectively deal with
the changes to come. MS is unpredictable, so being better prepared now
to deal with the changes in the future will go a long way to making
those changes more bearable.
