About as likely as me winning the PowerBall three times in a row.

That doesn't mean that she won't do business with gays or lesbians. She
already has. She's made great websites for gay or lesbian clients.

When she starts offering *wedding* websites, however, she will not be
offering websites which celebrate same-sex weddings.

The Supreme Court said that the First Amendment prohibits her state
(Colorado) from forcing her to create expressive designs speaking
messages with which she disagrees.

**TL;DR: It's not about the** ***people*, it's about the**
***message*.**
