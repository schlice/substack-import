Emperor Constantine is generally recognized as championing December 25th
as the recognized birthday of Jesus.

In the early church, Jesus' birthday wasn't celebrated *at all*. If it
was even recognized, it was generally lumped in with another church
feast, most frequently it was the Feast of the Epiphany on January 6,
since this was one of the church's earliest established feasts.

Constantine declared that Christianity was going to be the religion of
the empire in 336, and December 25th of that year is generally
recognized as the first time western churches celebrated Christ's birth
on that date, and celebrated his baptism on the Feast of the Epiphany.

There's also lots of talk that Christians chose December 25th to
coincide with pagan rituals, particularly the Winter Solstice, and
evergreen trees from the Roman New Year and such. The church never tried
to change pagan traditions, or even co-opt them, but they were happy to
add the December 25th day because eventually (while not so in the early
days) they thought that celebrating birthdays was important. This
birthday, in particular, slotted in just nicely at the end of December,
allowing the celebration of the baptism story on the day of the Feast of
the Epiphany.

The church is always happy to celebrate a birthday, especially this one
--- but only to have another opportunity to celebrate the special nature
of the person who was born.
