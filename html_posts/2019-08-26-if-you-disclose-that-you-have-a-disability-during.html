**If you disclose that you have a disability during a job interview, is
the interviewer then allowed to ask questions about the disability?**

Excellent question,
[[Leslie](https://www.quora.com/profile/Leslie-Merritt-2)]{.qlink_container},
thanks for asking.

Since you brought up the disability during the interview, the
interviewer can then ask you any questions they choose about the
disability. However, regardless of what they ask you, they may not use
any of that information to determine whether or not you qualify for the
job. None. The law doesn't prevent the interviewer from discussing a
disability that you brought up; the law prevents the interviewer from
*using* that information to make a decision about suitability of a
candidate to perform a job.

So it makes little sense to actually bring up a disability during a job
interview. It doesn't benefit the prospective employee, and it can't be
used by the employer to either grant or deny you the position.

The way this works is that the employment application lists a series of
tasks you must be able to perform. For example, "standing for four hours
at a time," "able to lift 50 pounds and move that weight no more than 50
feet at a time." "able to see colors to operate our proprietary
equipment," etc.

The application will then ask, "Are you able to do these things, **with
or without appropriate accommodations?**" That last phrase is key. If
you are disabled and you need assistance to stand for long periods at a
time (but you can do it), then you can answer yes to that question. This
puts the onus on the applicant to determine whether or not they can
actually accomplish the key tasks of the job. This is the **only** thing
you can discuss in the job interview: **can you do the job, with or
without accommodations**. You should not discuss the presence or absence
of a disability.

It is only **after** you are hired that you must then advise your
employer that you will need accommodations. As long as the
accommodations are not exceedingly onerous (usually because they are
prohibitively expensive), and as long as the accommodations don't
substantially interfere with how the employer does business (the
accommodations cannot force the business to fundamentally change how
they operate), they must be provided.

**TL;DR: There should be no reason for a prospective employee to bring
up a disability in a job interview. It doesn't benefit anyone.**
