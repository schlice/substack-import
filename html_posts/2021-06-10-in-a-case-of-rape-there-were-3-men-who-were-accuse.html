OK, I'll answer the law school question.

Under US law, there is no such thing as "degree of participation." There
is a difference in what they did, so there is a difference in how they
will be charged. The actual "doer" would be charged with rape, and the
other two would be charged with "aiding and abetting." Aiding is
assisting or helping someone commit a crime, and abetting is encouraging
or inducing someone to commit a crime. Because they did both, they will
commonly be lumped together as "aiding and abetting."

Original question:

**In a case of rape, there were 3 men who were accused. One was on top
of the woman, one held the hands, and the other held the legs. What is
the degree of participation of all accused?**
