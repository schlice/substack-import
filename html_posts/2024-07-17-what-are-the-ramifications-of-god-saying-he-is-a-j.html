1.  There is a great difference between God's ability to be jealous and
    ours. *God can be perfectly jealous, whereas we cannot*. God's
    jealousy is perfectly holy and perfectly righteous in protecting His
    honor and His glory. We, as fallible humans, cannot be perfectly
    jealous, because of our sin nature. Our jealousy is rooted in
    weakness and feelings of inadequacy.
2.  Jealousy is not why we should not "covet our neighbor's wife"
    (commit adultery). That's a false comparison. Adultery is a sin
    because it undermines the institution of marriage, it breaks the
    covenant you made before God, and it violates the rights of the
    other spouse.

> **He gets jealous if we worship other Gods. How many are there?**

Of course He does. He is God alone. The First Commandment says "I am the
Lord Your God. You shall have no other gods before me." But if He is the
only God, why does He have to tell people to have no other gods before
Him?

Because people create their own gods all the time. Money is probably the
biggest one, which is why Scripture says that the love of money is the
root of all evil. People devote their entire lives to acquiring money,
growing money, and keeping money. Money becomes a god for them.

We can turn anything into a god when we focus more on it rather than
Him.

So how many are there? As many as you can invent. But you shouldn't
invent any of them.
