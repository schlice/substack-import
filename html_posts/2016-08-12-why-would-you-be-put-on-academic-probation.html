You are put on Academic Probation (AcPro) when your GPA slips below 2.0.
You stay on Academic Probation for an entire semester. You get to attend
fun things like mandatory study time on weekends, or mandatory tutoring
sessions (depending on academic institution). Your grades are closely
monitored during that time. It's only during the semester that you spend
on AcPro that you have to go through the gyrations of mandatory study
halls and such.

Once your GPA bounces above 2.0, you're released from AcPro.
