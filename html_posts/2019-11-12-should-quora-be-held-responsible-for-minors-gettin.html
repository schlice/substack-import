**Should Quora be held responsible for minors getting advice on subjects
that in the real world would put you in jail?**

Let's go a step further.

*Quora* ***cannot*** *be held responsible for any advice that anyone
gets from their site.*

Most users tend to gloss over the [[Quora Terms of
Service](https://www.quora.com/about/tos)]{.qlink_container}, but this
might be a good time to go back and re-read them. You agreed to them
when you created a user account on the platform; might be useful to know
what it is you agreed to.

Quora's TOS isn't much different than most other message boards.
Basically, it says that it is completely not responsible for any content
that any user posts.

Allow me to be more specific for a moment.

> **9. Indemnification**
>
> You agree to release, indemnify, and defend Quora Entities from all
> third-party claims and costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees)
> arising out of or related to: i) your use of the Quora Platform, ii)
> Your Content, iii) your conduct or interactions with other users of
> the Quora Platform, or iv) your breach of any part of this Agreement.
> We will promptly notify you of any such claim and will provide you (at
> your expense) with reasonable assistance in defending the claim. You
> will allow us to participate in the defense and will not settle any
> such claim without our prior written consent. We reserve the right, at
> our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense of any matter
> otherwise subject to indemnification by you. In that event, you will
> have no further obligation to defend us in that matter.

Section 9 in the TOS is titled "Indemnification." This is where you
agree to not hold Quora responsible for anything you read on the site,
and it's also where you agree that you can't make a claim against Quora
for what you read on the site. Further, you have to *defend* Quora
against any claims against **you**. So if someone were to sue me for
something I posted on Quora (say a copyright claim), I'd have to defend
Quora from participation in that action and make it about me and the
claimant, making sure that Quora is not involved.

In other words, content on Quora belongs to the content creator, or if
you don't own the content, you assert that you have rights to use the
content.

I also like section 8d of the terms of service.

> d\. YOUR SOLE REMEDY FOR DISSATISFACTION WITH THE QUORA PLATFORM IS TO
> STOP USING THE QUORA PLATFORM.

In other words, if you are dissatisfied with anything at all about
Quora, your only legal option is to stop using Quora.

**TL;DR: No.**
