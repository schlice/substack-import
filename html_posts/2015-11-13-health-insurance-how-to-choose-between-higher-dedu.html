**Content:** [That\'s an easy one. Just figure out how often you plan on
using health services throughout the next few years.\
\
*But how is that easy? Do you have a crystal ball?*\
\
It is easy. For example, if you check my bio, you\'ll see pretty plainly
that I have MS. Therefore, it\'s a pretty good bet that I\'m going to
use a higher-than-average amount of fairly pricey health services
throughout the next year (I\'ll assume for brevity that you\'re looking
only to the next year). And while my kids are generally healthy, we seem
to have a genetic (or familial) predisposition to allergies. We have to
keep a very clean home, but that still means only a few sinus infections
per quarter, instead of continuous sinus infections. So I know that my
kids will not only be consumers of many over-the-counter decongestants,
allergy medications, and nasal sprays, we will also have many trips to
the doctor for diagnosis and treatment of sinus infections. So I know
that my *visits* to the doctor are going to be higher than average.\
\
Therefore, for me and my family, lower **deductibles** are better than
lower **premiums**. I understand I\'m going to pay higher premiums, but
based on the number and frequency of my expected visits to the doctor,
the lighter weight of my deductibles will be a much lighter burden to
take on, even considering the extra burden of a higher premium.\
\
This is why you have the option of a plan with either a higher
deductible, or a higher premium. If you and your family are generally
healthy, and usually only visit the doctor for acute conditions (i.e.
not chronic) or annual physicals (which are usually 100% covered by
insurance anyway), you should opt for the plan with the lower premiums
(saving you money deducted from your paycheck), but higher deductibles
out of pocket if you have to access medical services. If, however, you
are like my family, with some chronic conditions that keep us regularly
visiting the doctor, you might consider opting for a higher premium in
exchange for lower out of pocket expenses.]{.rendered_qtext}
