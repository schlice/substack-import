Those are indeed concerns. Some of those concerns are largely out of
everyone's hands, as not even Gavin Newsome could control the lack of
rainfall in California.

But some of the concerns are indeed choices which government leaders
could have made, such as allowing the priorities of the
environmentalists to win out over the priorities of the forestry
service. The fact that California has disallowed controlled burning to
remove undergrowth and fuel for wildfires is a direct contributor to the
quick spread of these wildfires. These fires have years of fuel to burn,
and the lack of water storage and rainfall aren't helping, as there just
isn't enough water to go around. Those are also policy choices, as they
could have prioritized water retention to prepare for times when water
is needed but droughts occur. They could have prioritized the creation
of water reservoirs, fed by both natural rainfall/snowmelt and import
through purchasing water from other locations. They could then manage
the distribution of water based on how much water is in the reservoirs
and how much is projected to be needed based on environmental concerns.
Pre-planning for droughts is work that is done now which won't see
benefit for years, maybe decades, and it's really easy to ignore when
faced with current problems.

It's a perfect storm of policy choices and Mother Nature.
