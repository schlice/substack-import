Yes, SMS messages can be used as evidence, if they are material to the
case at hand.

Generally, during discovery, SMS message conversations are retrieved by
subpoena directly from the carrier, not from any individual handset.
This preserves the integrity of the evidence and makes it admissible as
evidence in court.
