This is the very definition of "omnipotent," which means "all-powerful."

That means only he, unlike any of us, can do things that we believe are
"impossible."

For us, the Law of Causation applies. For us, Einstein's Theory of
General Relativity applies. For us, the idea of spontaneous generation
has been abandoned decades ago.

Not so for God.

As God exists *outside* of the universe and is not bound by its
constraints, God can, quite literally, do anything.

Just remember: if you ask a question that begins with "Can God..." just
know that the answer is always **Yes, God can.**
