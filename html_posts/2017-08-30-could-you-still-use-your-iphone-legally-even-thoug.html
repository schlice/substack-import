In 2010, Federal regulators added jailbreaking to a list of exemptions
from the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. This means that it is not a
violation of copyright law to jailbreak your phone.

They did not rule that jailbreaking does not violate the EULA. Apple
can, under its own power, deny users access to the iTunes Store, or deny
them access to any other Apple-owned service, if they violate the EULA
and jailbreak the device. Note that they have not done this, nor is it
in their best interest to alienate over 9 million iPhone users who have
jailbroken their phones. Additionally, they still want to have a
mechanism to update these phones to supported (and non-jailbroken)
firmware, so they will not block those phones from the Apple network.
Violating the EULA is not a violation of "law." You can still legally
use your jailbroken iPhone.

Remember, jailbreaking simply means that you "unrestrict" the phone so
it can run any application you choose, even applications which were not
specifically authorized or tested by Apple. Apple does not like this
because it degrades the user experience and introduces security
vulnerabilities from software which they have not tested.

But jailbreaking your phone is not "illegal."
