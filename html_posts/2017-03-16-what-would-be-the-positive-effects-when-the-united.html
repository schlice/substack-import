I added "hypothetical scenarios" to your list of topics for this
question, because clearly, it's a hypothetical. You do know in reality
that this will never happen, right? You would need a Constitutional
amendment and the will of a clear majority of America. You don't have
either.

The only "net positive" that would come from the US removing firearms
\[implied: from people who follow the law\] is that there might be fewer
accidental shootings in homes where firearms are left unsecured. You
might prevent a few accidental deaths.

There would be vast and far-reaching net negatives from removing
firearms from law-abiding citizens.

You can't remove firearms from those who choose not to follow the law.
Simply won't happen. So you can never remove all firearms. You would
only be removing firearms from people who follow the law (we call them
"law-abiding citizens").

Some gun owners may choose to retain their guns and become criminals.

I could go on and on with the negatives. But unless you find a way to
magically make all guns disappear, along with the knowledge about how to
build one, **you can never get rid of all firearms.** Period.
