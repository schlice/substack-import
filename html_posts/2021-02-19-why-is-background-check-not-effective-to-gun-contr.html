**Why is background check not effective to gun control in the US?**

Because they are not gun control. They were never intended as gun
control. They were intended to prevent known felons and mental
defectives from buying firearms. That's it. That's literally all they
do. They check to see if you are a known felon, or if you have ever been
adjudicated as a mental defective by a competent court of law.

Background checks are not a "predictor" of potential future bad
behavior. They keep legal guns out of the hands of known criminals, but
they do nothing to stop someone who has never previously committed a
crime (or more accurately, previously been caught committing a crime)
from using that newly-purchased firearm to commit a crime.

Also, when the NICS system was built out, in order to allow it to be
accessible to every American transferring a firearm from one person to
another, the price to size the system that large would have been
astronomical at the time. So a compromise was reached. NICS would only
be used by people "engaged in the business" of buying and selling
firearms; private sales between individuals would be exempted from the
background check requirement. While some states have since mandated that
all firearms transfers have a background check be performed by a
licensed FFL prior to the sale/transfer (and those states have found
that system to be mostly unworkable from both a legal perspective and an
enforcement perspective), at the federal level, private sales do not
require background checks.

So background checks, in their current form, only prevent sales of
firearms *from a dealer* to *prohibited persons*. They do nothing to
deter future crime. They do not prevent a person who was previously not
a felon from becoming a felon. And they do nothing when it comes to
private sales, because in most cases, they are not required for private
sales.
