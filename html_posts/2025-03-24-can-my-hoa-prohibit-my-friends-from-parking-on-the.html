Sure they can! They can do it by having a rule which states "no street
parking." The question becomes *what can they do about it?*

If your HOA has this "no street parking" rule in your Governing
Documents, and you agreed to be bound by those Governing Documents when
you bought your house, along with the rule that says that your guests
are also your responsibility, then the HOA can fine *you* when they
catch your friends parking on the street in front of your house.

At least, that's what the rule says. But *actually enforcing such a
rule* is where the wicket gets sticky.

For instance, *how do they know whose guest owns the car?* Do they stare
at your house until someone gets out and into the car? Generally no. In
most cases, the HOA can't determine, during the day, if the car in front
of your house is a guest, or even if it is someone coming over your
house to do legitimate business (i.e. an insurance agent, a house
cleaner, a tradesperson, etc). This makes the rule exceedingly difficult
to enforce during the day. But if the car is there *overnight*, there's
a better-than-average chance that the person is a guest staying at your
house.

To that end, when there is a "no street parking" rule, *it is generally
enforced* ***overnight***. Parking patrols usually head out late in the
evening or very early in the morning and catalog license plates.
Sometimes, they stick notices on the driver's window reminding the
vehicle owners that the HOA has a strict "no street parking" rule. But
if the vehicle owner is not present, even if the HOA paid to go through
their management company to run the license plates, what happens if the
person is not a resident? You just wasted that money, because the person
can't be fined.

The previous was all true for HOAs with public streets, as most are. But
the calculus changes *considerably* if the HOA is **gated**.ยน

If you live in a gated community, *the HOA owns the roads*. *The HOA
pays to maintain the roads.* That ownership of the roads means the HOA
can enforce its parking rules at any time. The HOA can hire a towing
company and tow/impound illegally parked cars. They can boot cars until
owners are identified, tickets are given, or in some cases, until
parking fines are paid, if they choose. They can issue speeding tickets
on their roads. They are, in effect, a quasi-governmental agency inside
of the gates.

You'll usually notice a big sign when you enter a gated community
indicating who the towing company for the HOA is, along with a notice
that entering the community means abiding by the rules, and if you break
the rules, your car can be towed at your expense (meaning you'll need to
pay the impound lot to get your car out).

(EDIT) I know you may believe that the HOA cannot issue you a fine for
parking on a public street. If you're going to bounce into the comments
and yell at me and tell me that there is no way the HOA can issue you a
fine for parking on a public street, **read this first.**

First, ***all states and all HOAs are different.*** Some states do not
permit HOAs to fine homeowners for parking on pubic streets. ***BUT MOST
DO***. And I can assure you, from personal experience as a Board member
in two states: **courts routinely rule these fines are valid.**

Second, ***the HOA is not giving you a state parking ticket***. The HOA
is giving you ***a fine for violating HOA rules.*** You can violate HOA
rules anywhere within the purview of the HOA: on a private driveway, in
a parking space, on private property, and even on a public street inside
the HOA. The HOA has broad statutory authority to enforce its rules
within its ***entire area of purview.***

You are welcome to believe that the HOA does not have this authority.
You are, of course, welcome to test this theory at any time. Here's how
you must do it:

1.  Live in a community with an HOA whose Governing Documents contain a
    "no street parking" rule.
2.  Violate this rule. The only way you can challenge the legality of
    the rule is to become a victim of it. It's called *standing.*
3.  When you are fined, sue the HOA and make your claim that the rule in
    question violates state law because the HOA cannot fine you for
    parking on a public street.
4.  *Be prepared to lose.* I'm not saying you will lose, but you must be
    prepared to lose. That means you will owe not only your fine (and
    any late fees), but you'll also owe attorney's fees and court costs.

I'm certain that some of you still want to go to the comments and tell
me that the HOA simply doesn't have that authority. Unless you are in a
position to test this theory yourself, please save it. None of us can
tell whether or not any particular Governing Documents in any particular
state has unlawful rules in them. The only way to determine if any
particular rule is lawful is to violate it and then challenge its
legality. I will delete any further comments regarding legality of
parking.

ยน This is also true of the less common situation where an ungated
community owns the roads, but in all cases where the HOA is gated, the
HOA owns the roads.
