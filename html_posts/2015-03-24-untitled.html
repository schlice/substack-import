**Content:** [*The point is that current law allows states and local
municipalities to pass laws that restrict, qualify, and set the terms of
when, where and how people carry weapons without running afoul of the
2nd amendment. Whether or not they choose to do so is an issue with
those governments.*\
Those laws already exist! People follow them daily! And you call them
nutjobs and menaces! Your fight is not with me, it\'s with the people
who write your laws. Because as you\'ve said before, you believe the
laws are woefully inadequate.\
\
*The idea that people are walking around legally carrying weapons who
maybe go to the shooting range once or twice a month (if that) is
frankly ludicrous. Anyone who does that is as much of a menace as the
criminal element is.*\
Good that you\'ve spent summers at target ranges and stuff. I\'m in law
enforcement. I\'m a military sharpshooter. I completed the whole police
qualification course with my strong hand and my weak hand. As for time
at the range, our cops are required to shoot once a **quarter.** That\'s
it. And as far as local police departments across the country, that\'s a
lot. Many local departments are only required to shoot once a year.
They\'re encouraged to shoot more than that, but to be honest, it
doesn\'t take much more than once a month to keep your skills honed.
Twice a month is ludicrous? You clearly have no clue what you\'re
talking about. Twice a month is **a lot**. Our military doesn\'t even
shoot that much.\
\
And thankfully in America the Second Amendment prevents control freaks
like you from pressing your silly agendas on those of us who choose
exercise our rights. We do what\'s necessary to protect our families,
and we use our level heads to not let criminals get the drop on us.
It\'s the concealed-carriers who I trust more than anyone else.
Concealed carriers kill fewer people than the police. The open carriers
are the nutjobs; I keep an eye on them.\
\
I\'m glad that you feel confident enough in your surroundings that you
don\'t feel the need to carry a gun. Good for you. You have no right to
press your feelings onto those of us who not only feel the need to carry
a gun, but who exercise their rights and do so safely and legally.\
\
You do what you want, I\'ll do what I want, and ne\'er the twain shall
meet. And I promise I won\'t use my guns to save you; you can save
yourself. Good luck with that.]{.rendered_qtext}
