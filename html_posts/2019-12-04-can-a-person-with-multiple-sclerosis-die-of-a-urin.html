**Can a person with multiple sclerosis die of a urinary tract
infection?**

Any person *can* die from a urinary tract infection (UTI), not just
people with MS.

Let's be more specific. The UTI itself won't kill you. However, that
infection can triggger a disease called *sepsis*. In sepsis, chemicals
released into the bloodstream to deal with an infection start to cause
inflammation throughout the body. An out-of-control reaction to an
infection can cause a chain reaction of inflammation throughout the
body, damaging organs and leading to a condition called *septic shock*,
which can be fatal.

People with MS often experience bladder-related dysfunction due to the
disease, so the incidence of UTIs in people with MS is higher than the
general population. Therefore, the risk of septic shock from a UTI is
greater in the population of MS patients than in the general population,
because the risk of UTIs is greater.
