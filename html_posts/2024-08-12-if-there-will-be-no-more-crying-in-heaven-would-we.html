The passage you are referring to when you reference "no more crying in
heaven" is from Revelation. While the apostle John was in exile on the
island of Patmos following the resurrection and assumption of Christ
into heaven, he was shown the future. He recorded what he was shown and
it became the book of Revelation.

Chapter 21 of Revelation discusses when John was shown "the new heaven
and the new earth":

> Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the
> first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more. And I saw the
> holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared
> as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the
> throne saying, "Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will
> dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be
> with them as their God. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes,
> and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor
> crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away." ---
> Revelation 21:1--4 ESV

So it doesn't exactly say that no one will be able to cry in heaven.
What it *does* say is that people will dwell together with God in the
hew heaven and the new earth, and all of the mourning and pain would be
gone. All of the sadness and **all of the tears** would be gone, because
God is going to defeat evil. So all the pain and all of the sadness will
be gone, and we won't have to cry because we won't be sad.

**TL;DR:** There won't be any **sorrowful** crying in heaven because
there won't be anything to cry about. *Tears of joy*, however, should be
the default, as there won't be anything that could be *more* joyful than
living in the presence of God for all of eternity.
