**Can you arrest a cop if he is no longer acting under the color of
law?**

You totally misunderstood what that phrase means.

"Color of law" refers to the appearance of the legal authority to take
an action. However, acting with the "color of law" says nothing about
the legality of the underlying action. In other words, police act with
"color of law" authority, when the underlying action may actually be
illegal.

For example, let's say the police act with "color of law" authority to
arrest someone. If, for example, the arrest was made without probable
cause, then the arrest, even though it was made with "color of law"
authority, would actually be illegal.

The problem is that you can't arrest a police officer for the
performance of his or her duties. Arguably, placing someone under arrest
is a police officer's duty, and doing so, he is acting "under color of
law." Whether or not the actual arrest (or whatever the officer did
under color of law) was lawful is a matter of law to be decided by a
jury. It's not something you can decide real-time.

Also, police can't "divest" themselves of the color of law. Police
officers are always police officers 24x7, even when they are off-duty.
Therefore, police officers always act with the "color of law," because
they always retain their police powers under the law. So technically, a
police officer can never act without the color of law.

Then, there is the functional aspect of trying to arrest an active
police officer. What's the reasonable amount of force you can use to
arrest a police officer? Good luck sorting through all the other cops
who will come racing to protect their brother/sister, whether or not you
think you're legally justified in making an arrest. At best, you'll be
arrested and found to be not guilty a few months later at trial. At
worst, the police will kill you after you assaulted a police officer
thinking that your cell phone is a gun, while the whole while you were
yelling something about "color of law."
