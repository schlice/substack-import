Since you're looking for nationwide statistics, your primary source of
statistics will be the [[Bureau of Justice
Statistics](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0f03ba&url=http://www.bjs.gov/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="bjs.gov"}]{.qlink_container} run by the US Justice
Department.

If you want more specific state stats, you're going to have a harder
time, as states do not all collect and present stats in the same way.
