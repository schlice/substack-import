**Content:** [Thanks for the A2A.\

I think the NRA can sometimes be misguided, because I don\'t necessarily
agree with all of their policies.\
\
For example, I don\'t think that we should have \"constitutional
concealed carry.\" I think there should be some licensing and training
that one should have in order to carry a concealed weapon. Carrying is
very, very safe, if it is done correctly. Weapons are designed to only
fire when the trigger is pulled, therefore the trigger needs to be
protected while you carry, safeties only work if you use them, etc. I\'m
all for \"shall issue\" laws. I\'m completely against \"may issue\"
laws.\
\
Also, I think technology has advanced to the point where we can (and
should) make some common-sense storage requirements for guns in homes.
We can still store guns safely while still being able to get to them in
a hurry. One safe I saw used a RFID chip in a wristband to unlock \-- no
combo necessary (but it also has a backup combo and key). I wear wrist
items all the time, wearing one with an embedded RFID chip to pop open
my gun safe is nothing to me. I think advocating against those items is
wrong-headed. I think advocating for more widespread (read: mandated)
use of such devices will only cause the technology to become more
hardened, more advanced, and more safe. As always, there are trade-offs.
There will be that one case where an armed intruder bests a homeowner
who couldn\'t get his safe open because it malfunctioned. There are
always edge cases when we do something as sweeping as mandatory storage
requirements. But I think the time is right to move forward with them.
The anti-theft aspect alone should be enough to convince people that
it\'s the right thing to do.\
\
But, my misgivings about some of their policies aside, the NRA is one of
the most powerful lobbies that the Second Amendment has, and one of its
strongest allies. Without them, the vast majority of gun owners would
crumble against the legislative tactics used by the very small but vocal
anti-gun minority. You\'ve seen what minorities can do to the country
unopposed (or more correctly, not strongly opposed). Having a powerful
ally to advocate your position is very helpful indeed.]{.rendered_qtext}
