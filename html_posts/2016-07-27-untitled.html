I see where you're going here. Just know that Quora is not a debate
site. I'm not here to debate you about the US invasion of Iraq. If you
want to ask about the legality of the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, then
ask that specific question. I will delete any further attempts to
quibble with my answer, but because I'm feeling rather litigious today,
I'll give you an answer.

The legality of the war was questioned from day 1. Any healthy democracy
should question the motives of its leaders. Ultimately though, under
national law, we approved the war. Congress authorized the war under the
[[Iraq
Resolution](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0af21a&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Resolution_to_Authorize_the_Use_of_United_States_Armed_Forces_Against_Iraq){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}, otherwise known as the
"Joint Resolution to Authorize the Use of United States Armed Forces
Against Iraq." This authorized the war under United States law.

Under international law, the case is far more fuzzy. The US and other
member states used the argument that Iraq was in violation of UN
Resolutions 660 and 678 when they invaded Kuwait in 1990. The US also
used Resolution 1441 as a legal standard to invade Iraq, when they
failed to fully submit to weapons inspections and failed to fully comply
with UN weapons inspection protocols. While Resolution 1441 did not
legally allow individual member states to act without Security Council
authorization, Resolution 678 allowed individual member states to work
with the government of Kuwait to enforce Resolution 660 with regard to
Kuwaiti sovereignty. So while it's sketchy, the legal justification is
there.

Let me give you a related example here in the US. When Obamacare was
found to be legal, the Supreme Court said that you have to make all
reasonable attempts to verify that a law is constitutional. The law's
authors said that Obamacare imposed a "fee" if you didn't comply; they
said very plainly it was not a tax. The Supreme Court said, basically,
it is levied by Congress, it is collected by the IRS, it is collected as
part of your taxes, so it's a tax, and since Congress is authorized to
raise taxes, it's legal. Regardless of what they said (it's a fee, not a
tax), it's a tax, and that makes it legal.

Using that same justification, while the wording of the invasion may
have been incorrect, and the primary reason for invasion may have been
the incorrect primary reason, if there is justification **at all** under
international law, we must therefore submit that the invasion is legal
and authorized.
