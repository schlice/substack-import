This is, again, another attempt to absolve criminals of poor behavior by
removing lethal force from the police arsenal.

By "dumbing down" the gun and making it do something which you think is
"non-lethal," you think you can solve the problems of people being
stupid.

The gun is lethal force. The officer uses lethal force when he
reasonably believes he or the public is at risk of death or grave bodily
harm.

As long as his belief is reasonable based on the circumstances and the
facts at hand, the officer is justified in using deadly force.

What if he's in a gunfight? An armed suspect is firing on him? His gun
is loaded with rubber bullets! It's like bringing a wet noodle to a gun
fight. Now you've actually hurt the officer.

We need better/more advanced/more accurate less-than-lethal options. We
don't need to dumb down the gun. The officer is supposed to be smart
enough to know when to use the gun and when not to. When the officer
reasonably believes his life is in danger or he is at risk of grave
bodily harm, his use of force is justified.
