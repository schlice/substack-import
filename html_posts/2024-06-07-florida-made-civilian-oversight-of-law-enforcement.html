First of all, any time someone says "Why does this seem wrong" it's
usually because it is.

So let's look at the two pieces of legislation Gov DeSantis signed into
law on April 12th of this year.

> SB 184 does the following:
>
> - Prohibits the harassment of a police officer or first responder who
>   is actively doing his or her job.
> - This law pertains to any person who has received a verbal warning
>   not to approach an officer and who approaches with the intent to
>   interfere with their official duties, threaten with physical harm,
>   or harass the officer.
> - Under this bill, an individual who harasses a law enforcement
>   officer in the line of duty will be charged with a second-degree
>   misdemeanor.
>
> HB 601 does the following:
>
> - Prevents anti-police activists from carrying out extrajudicial
>   investigations against law enforcement.
> - Codifies the creation of "Civilian Oversight Boards" to ensure they
>   are directed by a county sheriff or chief of police and are
>   comprised of at least three to seven members, all of whom are
>   appointed by the sheriff or chief of police.
>   - At least one member must be a retired law enforcement officer.
> - Ensures that misconduct allegations will be investigated by those
>   properly trained and equipped to handle such investigations, such as
>   Internal Affairs Departments or the Criminal Justice Standards and
>   Training Commission (CJSTC).
> - Increases all county sheriffs' base salaries by \$5,000 for each
>   population group.[\[1\]](#LZwxk){#cite-LZwxk .citation_link}

So now that we have the details about what was signed, let's look at the
questions.

> **The new rules say law enforcement now has oversight over the
> civilian oversight of law enforcement.**

No, the new rule says that **state law** has oversight over the civilian
oversight of law enforcement. The Sheriff only has the authority to
appoint the civilians to the Board, and at least one of the people on
the Board must be a retired officer. In this way, we can ensure that the
people who man these Boards are not only impartial, but have the
capacity to rationally review these incidents, recommending punishment
when necessary, but not excessively.

While it is commendable that law enforcement appointed civilian
oversight boards in the past (they are under no obligation to do so
until now), in the past it was local governments that did it outside of
the oversight of the department. While that seems to be transparent, the
people who often volunteered to serve on these boards did so because
they are specifically anti-police, and some of these civilian oversight
boards would use their platform to harass individual officers. This is a
problem that the Governor corrected.

Critics argue that extrajudicial investigations are imperative, because
the police allegedly will cover up crimes that their own commit.

Of course, this fails to realize that law enforcement activity is
subject to not only their department's review, but to the district
attorney who investigates crimes, and the Department of Justice who
reviews each incident to determine if the defendant's rights were
violated. Allegations of officer misconduct can't be swept under the rug
as easily as they could back in the 70s.

Additionally, this is the age where everyone has pocket access to a
high-quality camera which can record an incident and share it instantly.

Finally, thanks to the Biden administration's treatment of officers and
his calls to defund the police (which many states did), recruitment of
new officers is way down across the country. Florida, as a
law-enforcement-friendly state, was in a unique position to protect the
rights of officers from some of the radical anti-police elements popping
up across the country.
