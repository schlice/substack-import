**The House in SC passed a bill allowing open carry of guns without a
permit. What are your thoughts on this, now that Tennessee\'s Governor
is passing a similar bill?**

I lived in Colorado for more than 20 years where permitless open carry
was legal. Not for me personally (I never open carried in Colorado,
always held a CCW). I have never had a problem with others doing it. I
see a person with a firearm in a proper holster and I'm proud that we
don't deny people the right to carry a firearm if they choose. It
doesn't bother me. I saw a guy with a 1911 in a belt slide eating lunch
with his family and literally the first thing I thought was, "Man, I bet
that barrel gets dirty." But the one that I loved the most was seeing a
woman with several kids in line at Sam's Club and a pistol on her hip,
and it was no big deal for anyone.

Now I live in Florida, where there is no open carry, but concealed carry
permits are easy and relatively inexpensive to get. Here, if I were to
see an open carry weapon, it would be unusual. But it shouldn't be.
Someone carrying a gun in a proper holster should not be a threat to
anyone.

To me, it seems the law drives the culture. In this case, the law which
bans open carry makes it uncomfortable to see a firearm in public when
seeing a firearm should be a non-event.

So it will be a challenge for SC to go from previously no open carry to
open carry. I'm sure they'll get through it though.
