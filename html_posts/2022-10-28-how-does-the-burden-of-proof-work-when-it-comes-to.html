Before we can discuss a "burden of proof," we have to figure out what
"proof" is acceptable when you are discussing an infinite, immaterial
being that exists outside of the physical universe, and is thus not
subject to its laws.

What "proof" can be provided that the questioner will accept?

Will they only accept evidence of the material? Not only is that
position disingenuous (since materialism as a philosophy is false), but
it is not possible with an immaterial God. God is not "measurable." You
can't "detect" God. So the evidence is going to be philosophical and
logical rather than physical.

As limited human beings, therefore, we must understand that we don't
possess the type of knowledge that will provide us with absolute, 100%
proof of God's existence. But really, outside of the knowledge of our
own existence (I know I exist because I can question my own existence),
***everything*** **falls into the realm of probability.**

And yes, some faith is required to believe the proposition that God
exists. But isn't some faith required to believe *any* worldview? Even
pantheism and atheism? Atheism claims that there is no god. But how can
the atheist *know*? Had the atheist investigated every argument and
evidence of the existence of God? Can he answer every objection to
atheism? Of course not, and indeed it would be impossible to do so.

So the atheist, just like the theist, deals in the realm of probability
instead of the realm of absolute certainty.

So the question is not one of *proof*. The question is one of
*probability*, and which side has more evidence for their conclusion;
which conclusion is more reasonable.
