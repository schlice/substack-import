**Would the President very likely veto the resolution that was just
approved by the U.S. Senate to end Trump\'s border emergency
declaration?**

Yes. The President is expected to veto the resolution ending the
national emergency at the southern border.

Additionally, the Senate passed that resolution 54--41, which is not
enough to overcome that Presidential veto.

So it looks like the national emergency at the southern border will not
be stopped by Congress.
