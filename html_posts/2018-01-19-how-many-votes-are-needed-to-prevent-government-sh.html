Since the House has already passed the CR, it's up to the Senate to
pass.

They need 60 votes in the Senate. There are three Republicans who are
going to vote no, but even if they all voted yes, that would still be
only 51 votes. They need Democrats to play ball here in order to prevent
a government shutdown.
