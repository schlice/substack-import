**Is it not strange that an exhaustive two year report was boiled down
to a 4 page letter from Barr, since so much was uncovered and produced
37 indictments?**

It is strange that they took four pages for the Attorney General to say
"no Russian collusion from anyone in either campaign, no decision on
obstruction, which I then determined did not warrant indictment." I did
it in one sentence.

You're right, it is strange that it took him four pages to say that. He
probably wanted to add a little more detail.

All joking aside, he can't legally release the whole report, for a
number of reasons, primarily that there are some other investigations
which are ongoing (for matters that the Special Counsel referred to
other agencies), and also because some of the material was heard before
a grand jury and is therefore covered by "Federal Rule of Criminal
Procedure 6( e ), which imposes restrictions on the use and disclosure
of information relating to \"matter\[ s\] occurring before \[a\] grand
jury.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(2)(B). Rule 6(e) generally limits
disclosure of certain grand jury information in a criminal investigation
and prosecution. Id. Disclosure of 6( e) material beyond the strict
limits set forth in the rule is a crime in certain circumstances. See,
e.g., 18 U.S.C. ยง 401(3)."[\[1\]](#vtbLN){#cite-vtbLN .citation_link}

The Attorney General will work with the Special Counsel's office to find
all the "6(e) material" in the report, filter it all out, and then
release the redacted report to Congress and the people.
