Fornication is not illegal anywhere in the United States.

There are laws surrounding certain categories of fornication, and those
laws pertain to the age of the participants. In most places in the
United States, the ***age of consent*** is 18. Having sex when one
participant is below the age of consent is a crime called **statutory
rape**.

Several states have conditions on their statutory rape laws called
**close-in-age laws**. These laws state that if the two participants are
"close in age" to each other, the statutory rape law does not apply. For
example, a 19 year old having sex with a 17 year old. The idea behind
these laws is that it is more abhorrent for a 40 year old to have sex
with a 17 year old than it is for a 19 year old to have sex with a 17
year old. This is not true in every state, and not all states have
close-in-age laws, so check your local laws if anyone might be under 18.
