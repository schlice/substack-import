It depends on your worldview. And know that just for this answer, I am
not expressing my personal worldview.

Those of us with an **atheistic** worldview most generally believe that
we evolved from single-celled organisms from a "primordial soup" where
\*something\* happened and life spontaneously created itself. Then, over
millions and millions of years, those single-celled organisms started to
work together and create larger organisms and differentiate into the
estimated 100 million species on earth. It is those with the atheistic
worldview who believe that we evolved from monkeys or apes or whatever.
*From goo, to you, through the zoo.*

Those of us with a **theistic** worldview believe that God created the
world and intentionally created all of the plants and animals, and
eventually the human beings, the first two we call Adam and Eve. It is
this pair which seeded the world with humans.

Each side has their evidence for their belief, and each side thinks that
the evidence on the other side is lacking. ***And they're both right.***
