**My landlord says he's charging me extra next month because I often
bring guests over to my apartment. Could he do this if it wasn't on the
lease?**

In general, a landlord can't change the amount of your lease payment
without signing a new lease with you, or a *lease addendum* which again,
you both must agree to.

Unless there is some clause in your lease agreement which allows the
landlord to charge you for guests, then usually he can't change the
monthly rent amount without changing the lease itself.

If you have a month-to-month rental agreement instead of a full lease,
the landlord can change the rent every month.

You might advise your landlord that he probably can't charge you more
without amending your lease. Assuming you're a good tenant (you always
pay on time, you don't break things, you don't cause other trouble,
etc), you should be able to use that to your advantage when you talk to
your landlord.
