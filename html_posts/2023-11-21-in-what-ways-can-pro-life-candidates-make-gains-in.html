They need to **not shy away from it**.

While I'm not Ronna McDaniel's biggest fan, she's not wrong on the
pro-life issue, and what Republican candidates need to do to win.

When Republicans go front and center and highlight the extremism of the
Democrat platform, they win, every time. When they obfuscate and shy
away from it, they allow Democrats to define them as "anti-woman" and in
favor of women as nothing more than "baby factories."

Candidates need to get out in front of the issue and define themselves.
That's what voters want.
