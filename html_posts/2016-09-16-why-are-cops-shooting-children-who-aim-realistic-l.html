> *Why are cops shooting children who brandish BB guns?*

**Because children are using BB guns to commit armed robbery, and
because anyone who brandishes a weapon is considered a threat and can
legally be shot, not just by police.**

It's amazing, scanning the news stories regarding this shooting, that
the media is doing everything it can to make this another accidental
shooting of a boy playing with a BB gun.

*But they couldn't be more wrong.*

Tyre King, 13, was with a group of two other juveniles who just finished
an armed robbery. Tyre was armed with a BB gun with a laser sight. When
police arrived, one of the suspects was apprehended, and two suspects
fled.

*Be aware that at this point, the police were legally authorized to
shoot the fleeing suspects. Being able to shoot fleeing armed robbery
suspects has been upheld by the Supreme Court as they pose a very high
risk for injuring the public or for committing more crime. Note that the
police did not shoot the boys at this time.*

The two suspects were stopped by police, at which time Tyre drew his BB
gun and threatened officers with it. It was at that time that he was
shot.

This case is only similar to Tamir Rice in age, race, and outcome.
Everything else about it is different.

It's apples and oranges, people.

But don't worry, the facts won't get in the way of hate groups like
Black Lives Matter. I bet Al Sharpton is on an airplane as we speak.
