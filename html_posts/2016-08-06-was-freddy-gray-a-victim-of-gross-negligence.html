**Negligence** is a failure to exercise reasonable care.

**Gross negligence** is a conscious and voluntary disregard for the need
to exercise reasonable care, and which usually results in grave harm to
people or property.

Both terms arise from a failure to exercise reasonable care, but simple
negligence can be due to unconscious (or accidental) failure to exercise
reasonable care, where gross negligence generally implies conscious (or
intentional) disregard for the need to exercise reasonable care. Gross
negligence is conscious indifference to, or the complete disregard for,
reasonably foreseeable consequences which would arise from the failure
to exercise reasonable care.

I think you\'d have a hard time proving gross negligence, especially
since the police were already acquitted of criminal charges. Finding
that they consciously disregarded the need to exercise reasonable care
in prisoner transport is unlikely. They did follow all transport rules
which were in place at the time. They actually didn\'t have a mandatory
seat belt rule at the time Gray was transported.

Simple negligence is going to be easier to prove, but to what end? Even
gross negligence isn\'t enough to award punitive damages. You need to
prove willful or wanton misconduct before you can recover punitive
damages. Negligence claims can usually only recover actual damages.
