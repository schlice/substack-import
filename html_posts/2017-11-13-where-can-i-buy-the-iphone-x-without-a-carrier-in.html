You can buy your iPhone X [[directly from
Apple](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5a2929&url=https://www.apple.com/iphone-x/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="apple.com"}]{.qlink_container}. When you buy from Apple,
your iPhone X is not tied to a carrier.

Now, this said, you still have to pick your network. If you choose a
Verizon or Sprint iPhone, it will only work on those networks. If you
choose an AT&T or T-Mobile iPhone, you can use it on either network.
This is not because the phone is "locked" to that network, but because
of hardware differences between the iPhone radios.

Your phone will be locked to a network, as it says above, if you choose
carrier financing from AT&T or Sprint.
