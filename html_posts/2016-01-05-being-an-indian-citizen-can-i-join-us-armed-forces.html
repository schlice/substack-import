In order to enlist in the US Armed Forces, you have to be a citizen or a
permanent resident of the United States (which does not necessarily
require citizenship). From our friends over at

In order to become a commissioned officer in the US Armed Forces, you
must be a citizen of the United States. Therefore, your only option as a
non-US citizen is enlistment.

As an interesting side note, service in the US Armed Forces in this way
gets you expedited naturalization if you actually want to become a US
citizen.
