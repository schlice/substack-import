**In most areas in the United States, the cost of an ambulance ride is
billed to your health insurance, not to your taxes.**

We could turn this into a discussion about whether or not the United
States *should* (or even *can*) nationalize healthcare, but that's a
discussion for another question. I will focus instead on how things
*are* instead of how things *could be*.

Since ambulances are considered mobile *health care* and not government
services, and since health care is not provided by the government,
ambulances and their costs are billed to the patient's health care
insurance. Therefore, their costs are exactly what the insurance market
will bear.

Police and fire are services provided by the government (in fact, they
are exactly the type of services we pay government to provide).
Therefore, the appropriate method to fund them is taxes.
