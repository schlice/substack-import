Every builder, when designing a community, will choose a level of
*amenities* that he is going to offer, and each level of amenities will
cater to a particular type of homebuyer.

Will it have open space? Will it have a playground? Will it have a
swimming pool? Will it have a community hall with meeting spaces? Will
it have a workout facility? And the big one, will the community be
**gated**? Will there be a security guard checking access?

The HOA dues will directly correlate to the level of amenities offered
by the HOA and the number of homes in the community. In other words,
more amenities + fewer homes = high HOA dues. Fewer amenities + more
homes = lower HOA dues.

**TL;DR: There is a direct correlation between number of homes plus
level of amenities, and how much a homeowner will pay in dues, in any
one HOA.**
