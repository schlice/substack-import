**Do civilian reserve police officers receive mandated training before
being allowed to act like police officers and carry a badge?**

Reserve police officers (often called Auxilliary police officers) and
Reserve Deputy Sheriffs are indeed fully trained exactly as their
full-time counterparts. They are certified by the State's POST (Peace
Officers Standardization and Training) Board, and their training is
legitimate and legal under State law. Once they have received
appropriate training in accordance with POST standards, they are sworn
and badged. In Colorado, POST recognizes a Reserve Deputy Sheriff as a
unique law enforcement category with its own training path, comprising
over 300 hours of classroom instruction (all completed nights and
weekends), 50 hours of firearms, 40 hours of driving, and 40 hours of
arrest control.

Also, to clarify your question, when a Reservist is working, he or she
is a full law enforcement officer, able to perform all the duties and
responsibilities of any law enforcement officer of his grade and rank.
When they are not working, they are civilians.

**How do licensed police officers feel about reserves?**

When I was going through training, I'd run into deputies in the station
house. They'd recognize my uniform as a trainee and ask about why we
were training at night, and I'd mention that we were a class full of
Reservists. To a man, they'd all say something like "wow, that's cool
what you guys do, we really appreciate your help" and words to that
effect. They know we're out there doing the job just like they are, but
we're not getting paid for it. They appreciate us.
