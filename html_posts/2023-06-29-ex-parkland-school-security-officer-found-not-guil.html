> Do you think that was the right call?

Yes, it was the right call. There is no law that requires a police
officer to put themselves in the line of fire, or risk their lives
during a shooting, so prosecutors chose to charge him with felony child
neglect.

The case, therefore, came down to whether or not a law enforcement
officer had a "duty to protect" like a teacher who acts *in loco
parentis*.

The court found that, clearly, he did not. This follows decades of legal
precedent which states unequivocally that law enforcement officers do
not have a duty to protect any one individual. They have a "general duty
to the public at large," but they do not have any legally mandated duty
to protect any one person or group of people.

> What about his moral responsibility?

Morals are different for everyone. As those who are quick to tell us
that there is a bright-line distinction between church and state, since
there is no overarching moral authority, one person's morals may be
unique and different from everyone else.

Since there is no legally-accepted moral standard, our standard in this
country is **the law**. And the law says that a law enforcement officer
does not have a duty to protect.

Regardless of whether or not you feel his actions were "cowardly" (which
they may have been), his actions were clearly not illegal. Any opinions
about whether or not he may have violated some ambiguous moral standard
are just that: opinion.

For all you atheists out there who are fuming that this guy was just a
coward, you reap what you sow. Morals are only legislated as far as they
are enshrined in the law.

> Should there be any civil liability?

No. Since the deputy was working as a law enforcement officer at the
time, and he has either not been charged with any crimes, or has been
found not guilty of others, then qualified immunity shields him from
civil liability while performing his duties. The only case they could
attempt to bring against him was felony child neglect, but the court
found that he did not qualify as a caregiver in his capacity as a law
enforcement officer.

Therefore, he is protected by qualified immunity. Any civil charges
against him directly would be moot.

Since officers are shielded by qualified immunity, lawsuits for damages
are usually directed at the state or Federal government. In this case,
the Justice Department settled all of the 40 civil cases arising out of
the Parkland shooting in March of 2022. The
[[settlement](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d0f297&url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-civil-settlement-cases-arising-2018-school-shooting-parkland){.external_link

not admit any wrongdoing by the government. The parties have been in
litigation since late 2018, when the survivors of the shooting, and the
families of 16 people killed, sued the government for damages.

\

Again, this doesn't sit well with people, because everyone has this
image that "if you're a cop, you automatically run towards the bullets
and kill the bad guy and say something pithy when he goes down." And
while I agree with you in spirit, there is nothing in the police
officer's job description which reads "gets killed when necessary." Cops
wear soft body armor (Level IIIA) most of the time, which can stop
handgun calibers. Anyone with a rifle will punch right through that
stuff. So you're pitting a cop with basically no body protection and a
handgun against a potentially well-armed, more accurate shooter with a
rifle, who could take you out at a distance you can't hope to be
accurate at. You might feel like he *should have*, and you may be angry
at him for *not* blindly running in there, regardless of the risk, but
there's nothing in his job description, **or in the requisite law**,
which says that he was *required to do so*.

In other words, *you may think he's a big fat coward, but attempting to
charge him with a crime for being a coward just isn't going to fly.*

I don't like it any more than you do. It's a terrible situation all
around. But it's not one to be handled in the courts.
