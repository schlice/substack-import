**How many AP courses should I take to get into the Air Force Academy?
What about to become an astronaut?**

AP courses are not **required** in order to get into the Air Force
Academy. There is not a set number of AP courses you must take in order
to be admitted.

The Air Force Academy admissions process looks at two major academic
performance indicators:

- your Prior Academic Record (PAR)
- your College admissions test scores (SAT or ACT)

**Prior Academic Record:**

> Your **Prior Academic Record (PAR)** is a measure of classroom
> performance based on a combination of *your rank in class* and *your
> GPA*. When class rank is not provided, the PAR is based on our
> evaluation of your transcript, school profile and senior year
> schedule.
>
> To be academically competitive for an appointment to the Academy, we
> recommend completion of the following high school courses:
>
> - four years of English (with a college preparatory class in writing)
> - four years of math (strong background in geometry, algebra,
>   trigonometry and pre-calculus)
> - four years of science (lab-based and should include biology,
>   chemistry and physics)
> - three years of social studies (to include a course in U.S. History)
> - two years of a modern foreign language
> - one year of computer study
>
> **HIGH SCHOOL CLASS RANK**
>
> Generally, candidates must rank in the top 40 percent of their high
> school class. However, the average of recent entering classes is the
> top three percent. Adjustments are made to the PAR for students
> attending unusually competitive schools with a rigorous college prep
> curriculum and/or where honors and Advanced Placement courses are NOT
> weighted in the school's calculation of class rank and/or
> GPA.[\[1\]](#EliGL){#cite-EliGL .citation_link}

AP credit is generally given when you have a score of 4 or 5 on your AP
exams, and that credit counts toward core course placement, the exams
for which you will take during Basic Training.

**College Admissions Test Scores:**

> Students may take the SAT and ACT as many times as they'd like. Only
> the highest scores will be counted. Your test results must be received
> by Academy Admissions to be considered for an appointment. When you
> register for the tests, request your scores be sent to the Air Force
> Academy. The SAT code for the Academy is 4830, and the ACT code is
> 0530.
>
> Students who score below 580 verbal and 560 math on the SAT Reasoning
> and below 24 English/reading and 25 math/science reasoning on the ACT
> normally will not be competitive for an
> appointment.[\[2\]](#sjuxh){#cite-sjuxh .citation_link}
