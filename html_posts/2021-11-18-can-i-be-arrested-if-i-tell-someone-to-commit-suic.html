If you, unthinking (like most teens I know), angrily type "kys" in a
chat, you're usually not seen as someone who is "encouraging others to
commit suicide." You're usually just seen as an angry little jerk.

But there have been some fairly high-profile cases in the United States
where people were encouraged to commit suicide, and then the victim
actually did, and the encourager was held criminally responsible for
that. Usually in those cases, the encouragement was continuous and
direct enough to be seen as coercing to someone in an emotionally
fragile state.

However, most states do not directly have any laws against encouraging
suicide. A small number of states have laws that specifically address
encouraging suicide: California, Minnesota, Oklahoma, and South Dakota.
However, Minnesota's law was ruled an unconstitutional infringement on
free speech, and California found that criminal liability for
"encouraging" suicide must include some act which is more direct than
just encouraging words.

However, once we move away from the criminal, someone successfully
encouraging another to commit suicide could appear to be culpable in a
wrongful death lawsuit, and could be responsible for financial damages.
