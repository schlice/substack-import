If you stop and think about it, it's real easy to see why people refuse
to believe in God.

Like Jack Nicholson said to Tom Cruise in *A Few Good Men*, we can't
handle the truth.

The fact is that our rejection of religious and moral truth is often on
volitional rather than intellectual grounds---**we just don't want to be
held accountable to any moral standards or religious doctrine.** So we
blindly accept the self-defeating truth claims of politically correct
intellectuals who tell us that truth does not exist; everything is
relative; there are no absolutes; it's all a matter of opinion; you
ought not judge; religion is about faith, not facts!

Perhaps Augustine was right when he said that we love the truth when it
enlightens us, but we hate it when it convicts us.

Maybe we reject God because we can't handle the truth.
