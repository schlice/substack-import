If you are referring to "dependence" along the same lines as "chemical
dependence," which has symptoms such as:

- Tolerance to or need for increased amounts of the drug to get an
  effect
- Withdrawal symptoms that happen if you decrease or stop using the drug
  that you find difficult to cut down or quit
- Spending a lot of time to get, use, and recover from the effects of
  using drugs
- Withdrawal from social and recreational activities
- Continued use of the drug even though you are aware of the physical,
  psychological, and family or social problems that are caused by your
  ongoing drug abuse

then the answer is no.

However, as other answerers have pointed out, we MS patients are
nonetheless *dependent* on our drugs to keep the progression of the
disease at bay. There is no cure for MS, and the best we can hope to do
is to slow it down. Basically, we'll keep taking the medications until,
as my doctor put it, we're "too old to care." I'd say that, in some
capacity, that qualifies as *dependence*.
