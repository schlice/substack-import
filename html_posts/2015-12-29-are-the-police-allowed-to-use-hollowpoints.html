Yes, as far as I know, most law enforcement agencies still use hollow
point ammunition. Here\'s why:

Hollowpoint ammunition deforms much more than \"jacketed\" bullets (lead
with a jacket of usually copper) when striking soft targets. This does
several things: it imparts more of the kinetic energy of the bullet into
the target, and prevents the bullet from continuing on through the
target and hitting anyone behind the target (known as
\"overpenetrating\"); the bullet stops in the intended target. The
downside is that it does make a larger wound (which is presumably why
the Hague Convention of 1899 banned it) but it is a safer bullet for
bystanders, and more effective against a single target.

Most agencies I know of use JHP (jacketed hollow points) which are
essentially FMJ (full metal jacket) rounds with a hole drilled in the
tip.
