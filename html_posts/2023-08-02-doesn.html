Well, yes to the victimhood part, but no to the shirking responsibility
part.

Followers of Christ recognize that they are indeed victims. They are
victims of **sin**. They are born with a sin nature and are sinners by
that nature. They cannot escape their sin.

But they can escape the *consequences*. Jesus took the punishment for
our sin on Himself, so that we could be justified and made blameless. So
we're taking responsibility for our sin nature by believing in Christ
and accepting His gift of salvation.
