You make the President sound like a rapper. "DJ Trump." He's about ready
to drop a fire album...

You have only cited one half of the Constitutional issue, the War Powers
Clause, which states that Congress has the power to declare war.

The other side of the Constitutional issue is Article I, Section 2,
Clause 1: "The President is Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, of
the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called
into the actual Service of the United States ." This means that the
President is in charge of the military, not Congress, and the President
can issue orders to the military, including orders to strike another
nation. Presidents have used this authority with impunity for some time,
committing troops without Congressional approval.

Congress, after the Korean conflict, drew up the [[War Powers
Resolution](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c9fc07&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Powers_Resolution){.external_link

Powers Act").

This means, dear questioner, that the President ***can*** commit troops,
but he has to get authorization from Congress in order to *keep them
there.* Congress has drafted *Authorizations of the Use of Military
Force (AUMF)* in the past (most recently for the Global War on Terror)
which the Supreme Court has ruled are a valid substitute for a
declaration of war, and fulfill the requirements of the War Powers
Resolution as "approval" by Congress.
