**Do you think Trump wants to use the impeachment movement to give a
stage to information that would cripple the Democratic Party?**

I think it would be icing on the cake.

But ultimately, it's not necessary. The Democrats have been on a 3-year
temper tantrum after losing an election they thought they had in the
bag, and there's no sign of them slowing down. Trump Derangement
Syndrome is a real thing, and they are all afflicted with it. And Trump
just sits back and watches them destroy themselves.

This movement to impeach the President (which is the Golden Goose they
think will win them the election) is yet another sign of TDS. If Bill
Clinton can survive an impeachment for an ***actual crime*** (lying to
Congress), Trump can survive an impeachment where no actual crime
occurred.
