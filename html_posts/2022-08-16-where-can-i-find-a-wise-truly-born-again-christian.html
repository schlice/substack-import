I think this community qualifies. I'll speak for myself, as I hesitate
to ever call myself wise. But I have been born again through water and
the spirit, and I'm still a work in progress.

Ask your questions here, and we'll do our best to help!

(EDIT) If you want to go to a church to talk to someone, please find a
**nondenominational** church in your local area. You'll want to find a
**Bible-based** church, one which is governed by as many of the five
*solas* of the Reformation as you can find.
