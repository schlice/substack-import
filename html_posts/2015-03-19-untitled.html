do no matter who does it*\

Sadly, the law doesn\'t share your view. Lying, in and of itself, isn\'t
illegal. While it can be if you\'re lying about your own identity, in
most states, lying to the police is not illegal. It\'s not in your best
interest, but it\'s not illegal in and of itself (unless you are
deliberately lying to mislead the police and hamper an investigation,
which can be a crime). Similarly, the police lying to you is also not
illegal. Sometimes, the police have to use deceptive interrogation
techniques to get suspects to talk, and as you probably already know,
criminals usually aren\'t the sharpest knives in the drawer. A little
bit of deception can lead a criminal to divulge information he normally
wouldn\'t when directly asked.\

Check Chris\' answer again. He didn\'t actually lie, he said \"Do you
think your partner is going to protect you?\" You could expand on that:
\"When faced with \<possible sentences\>, do you really think he\'s
going to hold to the \'Bro Code\' and not roll on you? I\'ll bet you
he\'s doing it right now! You need to do the smart thing and get ahead
of this before it gets really bad for you.\" The officer doesn\'t know
that things are going to get really bad for the suspect. But the small
bit of deception can convince a suspect that it\'s in his best interest
to talk, and talk now.]{.rendered_qtext}
