**Once I stopped at a red light, late at night, and my car was barely
over the line of the pedestrian cross walk. A pedestrian, walking a dog,
crossed in front of me and intentionaly \[sic\] kicked my bumper. Do I
have any recourse?**

Don't stop over the line.

Legally, your tire has to cross the stop line before you are "blocking
the crosswalk." So as far as the law is concerned, you probably weren't
even legally considered to be blocking the crosswalk.

Do you have any legal recourse regarding someone kicking your car?
Probably not. It's probably likely that the person did not damage your
car by kicking the bumper. On the off-chance that they did, you would
have needed to call the police and report the destruction of property,
but again, this would only be true if there was actual damage to the
bumper.
