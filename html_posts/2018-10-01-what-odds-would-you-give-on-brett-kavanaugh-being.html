**What odds would you give on Brett Kavanaugh being confirmed to the
Supreme Court? What do you base this on?**

I would give it a 90% chance, because I'll never say anything is a sure
thing, but this is pretty close.

Here's what I base this on:

- At the end of the regular investigation period, it was going to be a
  party line vote, but he was going to get approved.
- The whole Blasey Ford kerfuffle happened, and Republicans allowed
  Democrats to climb up on to the hill that they chose to die on: **we
  need an FBI investigation.**
- Republicans allowed them to die on that hill by giving them an FBI
  investigation, which we should all be aware at this point will not
  reveal anything. Seriously, if every media outlet in the country was
  scouring under every rock and shrub looking for any corroborating
  evidence and they were unable to find it, and the FBI themselves was
  unable to find it in **six** background investigations, they're not
  going to find anything new in a seventh. (EDIT) I'm seeing tweets from
  ranking Republicans confirming that there *will* be a vote this week,
  and there will be no further obstruction or delays. Clearly, Dems
  chose the hill they were going to die on, and they will die there this
  week.
- While Dr. Ford's testimony is compelling, we should all be aware by
  now that memories are fallible. The fact that she believes her
  memories so strongly only shows that she believes what she remembers.
  It has been well established in neurology and psychology that [[you
  can both be 100% certain, and 100%
  wrong](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ea756d&url=https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/09/cognitive-science-false-memories-more-common-than-you-think/){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
  qt-tooltip="nationalreview.com"}]{.qlink_container}. Without
  corroboration, memories alone are not reliable enough to derail a
  presidential nomination.
- The FBI investigation also gives all the original yes voters cover to
  be certain of their yes votes. The only thing the FBI investigation
  will do is embolden the yes voters. It's not going to turn any no
  votes into yes votes unless they were already undecided swing votes,
  and there are scant few of those. The investigation will give them the
  political cover to vote yes.
- Therefore, barring some miraculous surprise, there isn't enough
  evidence to turn any of the yes votes into no votes. Senators who flip
  their yes votes into no votes based on this allegation are climbing
  their own hill on which their political careers will die.
