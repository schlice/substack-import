**Content:** [I don\'t understand the logic.\
\
In the state of Colorado, \"open carry\" is legal. So an ordinary
citizen can strap on a weapon with no training or licensing, but a
highly-trained community-minded peace officer cannot?\
\
The only logical conclusion that I could find is that police would be
essentially \"neutered,\" only able to counter the deadly force they
face daily with non-lethal alternatives, such as batons, TASERs, and
pepper spray.\
\
I would also see the use of other non-lethal tools increase, such as
\"bean-bag\" guns or rubber bullets.\
\
Consequently, I think you\'d see police brutality increase, as officers
would have to over-compensate for the fact that they do not carry lethal
force while everyone they encounter can.]{.rendered_qtext}
