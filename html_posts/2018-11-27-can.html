I like Wikipedia's definition of a perjury trap.

> A **perjury trap** is a form of prosecutorial misconduct in which a
> prosecutor calls a witness to testify, typically before a grand jury,
> with the intent of coercing the witness into perjury (intentional
> deceit under oath). Most often a perjury trap is employed because the
> prosecutor is unable to prosecute the defendant on other charges.

> the expired crime, that would be perjury---a new crime, which could
> then be prosecuted. Prosecution for perjury elicited in this manner

So it isn't just "don't lie." It's clear that the impetus behind a
perjury trap is tricking someone into committing perjury.

So while the answer may be as simple as "don't commit perjury," it's
more difficult than it may sound.

(EDIT) My commenters (who by the way, I really appreciate, thank you)
seem to be leaning in the direction of "we don't understand how this is
a perjury trap. Can't you just plead the 5th, or refuse to answer the
question because it is irrelevant?" Well, yes you can. Of course the
correct answer is to plead the 5th. You may have less success with the
question of relevancy because there isn't an actual jury present (we'll
get there in a sec), but it's certainly an option. The absolute correct
answer, though, is to plead the 5th.

But in the example above, we're talking about a *grand jury*. This is
where a prosecutor would try a perjury trap, not in open court with a
judge and opposing counsel present. A perjury trap question in open
court would be immediately objected to by your lawyer for relevance, and
most likely the judge would force the prosecutor to ignore that line of
questioning and move on.

However, in a grand jury, it's just you, the prosecutor, and over 20
jurors, in a closed courtroom. No witnesses, no visitors, no judge.
There's a fair bit of pressure, and the feeling of a lack of protection.
A person of weaker constitution, when faced with one of these questions
in such a situation, might be tempted to lie. In that moment, the person
goes from "witness" to "accused," and if you're unprepared for that
shift, you may be tempted to lie your way out of it...

...thus, the trap.
