In general, the contract of carriage requires the company get you to
where you are going.

And that's about it.

They try to get you there at the agreed-upon time, but that's not always
feasible because of unforeseen circumstances. Some of these
circumstances (i.e. things that are the airline's fault) entitle you to
a refund. Some (especially weather-based ones) do not.

Airlines have different policies depending on what caused the delay.

But even if the airline puts you on a **bus** and drives you to your
destination, you have completed the contract of carriage.

I have had this happen to me. I live in Colorado Springs, and on
occasion, I will have a connecting flight between Colorado Springs and
Denver (about 75 miles between the airports). One time, the Colorado
Springs Airport was completely closed due to weather. The airline
decided to put us all on a bus and drive us to the Colorado Springs
Airport. We actually still ended up in the terminal, still picked up our
luggage at baggage claim, but our transport was a bus.

There is no requirement in the contract of carriage that you will
actually be transported by aircraft. The only requirement is that the
carrier gets you where they said they were going to take you.
