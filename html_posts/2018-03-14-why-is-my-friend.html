**Why is my friend's Galaxy S5 Prime periodically turning off and not
turning back on for a while?**

There are several things which can cause this behavior, but it's most
likely hardware-related.

When a phone turns off because of something software-related, the
software gets reset when it turns off, so it should turn back on
immediately.

If the phone will not turn back on for a while, the problem is most
likely hardware-related, and in this case, is probably related to heat.

If a phone gets too hot, circuitry inside the phone will power it off to
prevent it from overheating to the point where the heat will damage the
phone. Depending on cases and other accessories, you may not even know
exactly how hot the phone is getting. Once the phone sufficiently cools
down, it allows the power to turn back on again.

Your friend should try taking the phone out of its case for a while and
see if that helps. At the very least, he'll know pretty quick if it's
overheating.

He could try to reset the phone back to factory condition.
Malfunctioning software could be causing the phone to run too hot. A
full factory reset will clear that up.

If that doesn't work, he should take the phone in for service. There may
be lint or dust blocking the heat pipes which move the heat away from
the processor and to the body of the phone. A good phone repair place
can clean out that gunk and have the phone running cooler.
