What you should do depends on whether or not the police have a search
warrant.

If the police have a warrant, check the warrant to make sure that the
address on the warrant is yours. If it is, you have no choice but to let
them in to search for the person, even if they literally have the wrong
house and the person they are looking for is not associated with you in
any way. If the warrant is for the wrong house, advise them that they're
at the wrong address.

If the police do not have a warrant, insist that they have the wrong
house and the person is not there. They cannot enter. Let them hang out
in front of your house for as long as they wish to waste their time.
Hopefully, you already have security cameras in front of your house and
you can capture the entire incident and save it in case they damage
something. You'll need the video evidence to seek damages from the
department for whatever they break.
