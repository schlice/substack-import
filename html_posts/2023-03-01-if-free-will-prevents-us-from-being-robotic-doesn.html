Why would you be sad? They made a choice. They made an active,
knowing-full-well choice to reject God. They looked at what God was
offering and what Satan was offering and they knowingly chose what Satan
was offering.

They exercised their free will. Why would that make you sad?

They chose their fate. They chose a little temporary pleasure on earth
instead of everlasting communion with God. They knew what they were
doing, as the truth is written on the hearts of all people:

> Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things
> required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they
> do not have the law. They show that the requirements of the law are
> written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and
> their thoughts sometimes accusing them and at other times even
> defending them. --- Romans 2:14--15 NIV
>
> For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel
> after those days, declares the Lord: I will put my law within them,
> and I will write it on their hearts. And I will be their God, and they
> shall be my people. --- Jeremiah 31:33 ESV
>
> "This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days,
> declares the Lord: I will put my laws on their hearts, and write them
> on their minds," --- Hebrews 10:16 ESV

And even if they ignore what is written on their hearts, they cannot
ignore what is all around them:

> For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities---his
> eternal power and divine nature---have been clearly seen, being
> understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.
> --- Romans 1:20 NIV
