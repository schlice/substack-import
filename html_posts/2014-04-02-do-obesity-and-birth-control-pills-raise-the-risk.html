**Content:** [To the best of my knowledge, there have not been any
studies linking obesity to MS, nor have there been any studies linking
the use of birth control pills to the risk of MS.\
\
Although, since women develop MS at a rate 2 to 3 times that of men, the
assumption is that there is a hormonal component to MS. But, as you
point out, an environmental component unique to women (birth control
pills) could also be a factor. It\' definitely worth
studying.]{.rendered_qtext}
