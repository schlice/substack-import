<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [To the best of my knowledge, there have not been any<br>studies linking obesity to MS, nor have there been any studies linking<br>the use of birth control pills to the risk of MS.\<br>\<br>Although, since women develop MS at a rate 2 to 3 times that of men, the<br>assumption is that there is a hormonal component to MS. But, as you<br>point out, an environmental component unique to women (birth control<br>pills) could also be a factor. It\' definitely worth<br>studying.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
