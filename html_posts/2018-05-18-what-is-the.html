**What is the \"GINI index\" and what does it have to do with mass
shootings in America?**

The [[Gini
Index](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2942d1&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_Gini_coefficient){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} shows income inequality
as a coefficient. In the index, 0 equals complete equality; all people
have exactly the same income. 1 equals complete inequality; all of the
wealth is held by one person and everyone else has none.

There is a positive correlation between a higher score in the Gini Index
(higher income inequality) and higher rates of violence in general. Note
that correlation does not equal causation, and no one is claiming that
rates of violence are directly tied to higher income inequality. It's
simply a correlation. We've noticed that in areas with higher rates of
crime, they also tend to rate higher on the Gini Index.

There is no direct correlation between a higher Gini Index rate and a
higher incidence of mass shootings.
