The circumstances Rick recounted are the exceptions. They are the
exceptions that allow an officer to enter a home without a warrant and
without permission of the occupants. Those exceptions include

1.  Exigent Circumstances. If I know (or can reasonably discern) that a
    person\'s life may be in jeopardy, I may legally enter a home or any
    other private property within my jurisdiction, over the objections
    of the homeowner/tenant/occupant.
2.  Hot Pursuit: If I am chasing a suspect and that suspect enters a
    private residence, private property, or other location where I would
    normally need a warrant to enter uninvited, I can legally enter that
    property to catch the suspect, again over the objections of the
    homeowner/tenant/occupant/suspect.

There may be others in some jurisdictions, but these two are relatively
constant amongst all jurisdictions in the US, and in most of the modern
world as well (see some of the UK answers). In all other circumstances,
an officer must be invited in to a home, or must have a warrant to
enter.

That said, even if the officer is legally not allowed to enter your
home, it is illegal for you to interfere with an officer who is
performing his job.

Let me say that again: it is a crime to interfere with the discharge of
an officer\'s official duty, ***even if you believe, or even if you
KNOW, the officer is acting illegally.***

The reason for this is very simple. Whether or not the officer was
acting legally is **a matter of fact to be decided by the court,**
***NOT*** **a matter for you to decide at the scene.** Therefore, until
a court rules on the legality of the officer\'s actions, you have no
right or authority under the law to deny him the ability to do his job.
You would be doing so without having received a ruling from a competent
court in your jurisdiction. This is a crime. Interfering with the
discharge of an officer\'s official duties is a crime for which you can
be arrested and charged, *even if the officer is later found to have
acted unlawfully*. This is why groups such as \"Cop Block\" are so
dangerous; their protagonists will be arrested and charged, even if it
is later determined that the officer was not acting legally.

Remember that if the officer enters your home illegally and finds
something incriminating and then arrests you, once your lawyer shows up,
the entire arrest gets thrown out and you walk. Then you sue the
department and buy a new car. Or two.

The officer is also under no obligation to detail for you the reasons
under which he is allowed to enter your home. If an officer enters your
home without your consent, your only recourse is to remind the officer
that you have not given him permission to enter your home, and you have
not consented to a search. If you are recording the interaction, make
sure your denial to consent to search is recorded. Once the officer
leaves, contact a lawyer. As Rick said, the place to fight them is in
court. If you try to physically interfere with a police officer, you
will lose. Every time. It\'s tough to be right and still be in jail,
maybe even a little worse for wear. Don\'t do it.

And as many of us have said over the years on Quora, you have many forms
of redress for your grievances that you can exercise. ***NOT ONE*** of
them takes place at the scene.
