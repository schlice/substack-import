No.

There is a pervasive belief in society that one supreme being created
all religions, and that people around the world just interpreted that
one religion differently. They basically believe that all religion came
from the same God, even though they teach different (and contradictory)
things. If that were true and all religion came from one god, then it
wouldn't be right to criticize any of them.

However, God does not contradict himself. God is not "a God of
confusion" (1 Cor 14:33 ESV). Since some religions teach things which
are in contradiction, it is not logical that one God created all
religions. And if it is true that there is one supreme being that was
just misinterpreted, then not all religions are "right." Only one is
"right," and the rest are misinterpretations of the "right" religion.

The teachings of Buddhism contradict the teachings of the Bible:

- The Bible tells us that Jesus was raised from the dead; Buddhism
  denies this.
- The Bible says that belief in Jesus' death and resurrection are the
  only way to salvation. Buddhism claims you must follow "the eight fold
  path" to Nirvana.
- The Bible teaches that each of us has an eternal soul which will be
  judged on the last day, and when we die, we await the day of
  judgement. Buddhism teaches that we are in a constant cycle of rebirth
  until we reach Nirvana.

Because of these (and other) contradictory teachings, it is not possible
that God created Buddhism or that God created Buddha to teach people
anything. Because the teachings of Gautama Buddha contradict the
teachings of the Bible, it is not logical to believe that God created
Buddha to teach people.

God sent Jesus to teach people. God did not send Buddha to teach people.
