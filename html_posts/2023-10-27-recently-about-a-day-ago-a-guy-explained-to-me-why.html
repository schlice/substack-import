That feeling you have, the nagging voice that tells you that abortion is
wrong, is your *conscience*.

We all have it. We all know it. Murder is wrong, regardless of who you
are or where you live, or when you lived. Murder has always been wrong,
and everyone *just knows it. Even murderers* know that murder is wrong.
They simply¹ justify their actions.

Intuitively, you know that illegal (unjustified) killing is wrong.
Intuitively, you know that the baby did nothing to earn the death
penalty. It's not the baby's fault that it's in the position that it is
in. Intuitively, you know that it's not a "clump of cells." It's a
human. Albeit a very early human, but a human nonetheless. And that's
the only definition we can accurately place on it. We can't place the
label of "person" on it, because that's a sociological term, not a
scientific term. The only scientific term we can place on the baby is
"human" because it belongs in the species *Homo Sapiens*. Once the egg
is fertilized, it starts dividing. And growing. And using energy. And
producing proteins. Human proteins. Not dog proteins, or frog proteins.
Human proteins. It is a human. And because it is human, it has the same
human right to life as every other human, everywhere else in the world,
regardless of how old it is. Intuitively, you know this.

You may **know** in your mind that in order to have peace with those who
place differential value on life based on its temporal locality (i.e.
its place in time and space), our laws must allow (to a certain extent)
some flexibility for abortion early in pregnancy. And in nearly all
states which restrict abortion, there is some flexibility for abortion
very early on in pregnancy.

But that feeling you keep having, your conscience, tells you that you
**also know** that abortion is wrong.

Even those who are pro-choice know that murder is wrong. But they only
have the luxury of knowing this because their parents *chose* to allow
them to be born. They have "birthed human privilege," and they don't
even recognize their own privilege.

For those of us who recognize the urgings of our consciences for what
they are, we must continue to find common ground with those who deny the
urgings of their consciences, while working to ensure that ***ALL***
humans are granted equal rights to life, regardless of how old they may
be, or where they are physically located.

\

¹ I'm not trying to say that it's easy to justify murder. It's not. But
some people have the ability to justify what their conscience tells them
is wrong. This is *free will.* This ability to make choices, **even the
ability to deny the truth**, is what makes us moral creatures, and
ultimately allows us to choose our own destiny.

\

**PLEASE NOTE: This is a controversial answer.** I know that people
approach this topic very emotionally. I'm willing to engage in polite
discussion regarding this issue, but *I will not tolerate rude or
disrespectful commentary.* If you even become the slightest bit
harrassing, I will summarily delete your comments and block you. I will
do this immediately and without compunction. You have been warned. Be
nice.
