**Content:** [Because when there is questionable evidence as to whether
or not a crime has been committed, the District Attorney will take the
case to the Grand Jury to see if there is enough evidence to go to
trial. If we took every case directly to trial, even if there may not be
enough evidence to support a charge, we\'d clog the court system in a
hot second.\
\
The Grand Jury is a boon for the prosecution, by the way. It\'s
basically a mini trial, but with NO DEFENSE! If you\'re a guilty cop,
you are SCREWED at the Grand Jury. You can\'t even defend yourself! You
have to testify and it\'s all against you.\
\
However, if you go to the Grand Jury and they can\'t find enough
credible evidence to support going to trial, then there was absolutely
no way you could possibly win at trial with a vigorous defense. If a
prosecutor can\'t get a Grand Jury to indict, he\'d have no chance in an
actual full trial.]{.rendered_qtext}
