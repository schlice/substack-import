That won't work.

If you want to write a petition, petition your fellow human beings to
**stop going to movies where guns are used.**

That's the only petition Hollywood will care about: **profit**.

Right now, people are still paying to see movies with guns. And as long
as people are paying to see them, Hollywood will gladly make them.

If you can convince people to stop paying for those movies, then
Hollywood will think about making a different kind of move which will
appeal to people.

Original question:

Since so many in Hollywood are anti-gun, can we petition Hollywood as a
whole to stop using guns in movies?
