**How can I report a person I suspect is not a soldier?**

There is no law that prevents a person from lying about being a soldier.
In fact, the First Amendment in the United States protects freedom of
expression.

If the person is lying on a social media platform, you might report the
lie to the platform. Perhaps it violated a use agreement for the
platform.

If you see someone dressed in a military uniform who you suspect is not
a soldier getting a cup of coffee with a military discount, report them
to the police. Theft of service is illegal.
