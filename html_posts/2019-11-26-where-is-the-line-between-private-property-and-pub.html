**Where is the line between private property and public safety, in the
case of a person booby trapping packages on their front porch?**

This is the only type of "booby trap" allowed:

You cannot create booby traps which harm other people.

This one doesn't cause harm. It causes a tremendous mess and a lot of
stink. And that's about as far as you can go before you get yourself in

be able to reproduce it.
