\"According to reports, the final tally for the Baltimore riots is that
over 200 businesses were destroyed\"\
\
I know, no one believes a conservative reporter, but he got his stat
directly from a local news anchor, Seni Tienabeso (@SeniABC) [[May 3,
2015](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6a1dd6&url=https://twitter.com/SeniABC/status/594906894101303296){.external_link

following:\
\
\"Maryland Gov Hogan says 200 businesses were lost in Baltimore as
result of the riots, most were minority-owned and without insurance.\"\
\
And it\'s a fair bet that those businesses will never re-open.\

If it\'s not a slum now, it will be.]{.rendered_qtext}
