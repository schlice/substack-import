There are indeed connections between both diseases, however slight.

The primary site of nerve damage in achalasia patients is the
**esophageal myenteric plexus** at the lower esophageal sphincter (LES).

Some studies, however, have indicated that nerve damage further back
(towards the brain) could be the culprit, and the nerves at the LES were
actually intact. When the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve is
altered, achalasia symptoms may be present, and the vagus nerve can be
altered by multiple sclerosis.[\[1\]](#PqjAD){#cite-PqjAD
.citation_link} To date, it has not been proven.

There is also a connection between achalaisa and multiple sclerosis in
that they have both been positively linked to autoimmune
responses.[\[2\]](#AahaT){#cite-AahaT .citation_link}
