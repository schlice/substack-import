*Objection, Your Honor, counsel is arguing facts not in evidence.*

Sounds like you might be describing something out of disgruntled former
White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham's new tell-all book *I'll
Take Your Questions Now*.

[[https://www.amazon.com/Ill-Take-\...](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5f0050&url=https://www.amazon.com/Ill-Take-Your-Questions-Now/dp/0063142937){.external_link

It is at least conceivable that someone from the press corps which
covers the White House might ask Ms. Grisham about the allegations from
Stormy Daniels' account of her time with the President wherein she
claimed that his penis looked like "a toadstool." And it also might be
conceivable that the President wanted to "set the record straight," as
it were, with regards to whatever toadstool-like quality may or may not
be present in his penis. Therefore, in at least one viewing of the
situation, it is at least conceivable that the President might pass this
information on to his press secretary.

> **Is this normal business practice for a CEO?**

No, this isn't listed in the standard business practices of a CEO. But
this is irrelevant because at the time, Trump wasn't a CEO, so I'm not
sure why you're asking about whether or not this is a normal thing for a
CEO.

It is, however, conceivable that a President may want to brief his Press
Secretary about a question that she may receive, and how he wants her to
answer that question.

Original question:

When Stormy Daniels described Trump\'s penis as very small, he called
all of his female staff individually to deny this and described its size
and girth to them to set the record straight. Is this normal business
practice for a CEO?
