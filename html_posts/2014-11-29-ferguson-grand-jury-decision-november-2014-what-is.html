**Content:** [Like the other officers said, very much depends on the
orientation when the grab happens, but in all cases is considered life
threatening.\
\
When I stand facing someone, I usually have my hands folded in front of
me. What you usually don\'t see is my right forearm resting on the grip
of my duty weapon to detect a potential grab. Were someone to try to
grab my weapon at that point, they\'d end up with a mouthful of elbow
and an arrest.\
\
If I were in my car, as Officer Wilson was, I can\'t say I\'d act much
differently than he did. I am about Officer Wilson\'s size, so I would
consider such an assault a life-threatening one and world likely respond
using lethal force.]{.rendered_qtext}
