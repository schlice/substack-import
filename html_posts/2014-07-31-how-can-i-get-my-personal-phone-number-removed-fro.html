If you are registered as a small business, you can change your profile
so it \"\...reflects what you\'d like the world to know. You can choose
exactly what information is displayed about your company on Manta.\"\
\
Just sign in to your profile. Don\'t have a profile but your business is
still listed? Find your business information and click the \"Own this
Business?\" link. It will walk you through the process of setting up
your business account.]{.rendered_qtext}
