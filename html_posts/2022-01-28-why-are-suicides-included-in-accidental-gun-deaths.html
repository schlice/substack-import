Suicides are never included in ***accidentai gun death statistics***
unless someone is intentionally lying to you.

Suicides are included in ***All Gun Death*** statistics, even though the
gun wound was self-inflicted, when the *intent* of the statistic is to
show incidents in which one person shoots another one.

Suicides are added because 33,000 deaths a year looks like a much bigger
number than 11,000 deaths a year (when you exclude suicide).

\

Original question:

Why are suicides included in accidental gun deaths when it is an
intentional act and intentional suicides by cars aren\'t counted as an
accidental car death?
