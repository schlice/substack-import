**Do local police have the means to spy on text messages?**

First of all, no one can "spy" on text messages. SMS is highly
regulated, far more so than messages within an app. SMS is regulated
just like phone calls: you need a warrant to get them.

In order to "spy" on text messages, the police must go to the wireless
carrier, who can provide copies of SMS messages. The police can only do
this with a warrant. There is no technology that allows you to "spy" on
a text message. SMS does not work that way; it's not like "tapping an
analog phone line" and listening in.

What *can* happen is that someone can install spyware on your phone. One
of the most well-known of these apps is called **mSpy**. It can allow
remote access to the GPS location, SMS messages, and communications
through nearly any other communications app (i.e. WhatsApp, SnapChat,
etc). But this involves physical access to your phone and someone
installing an app. It can't be done remotely. Additionally, to track
anything beyond phone calls and SMS, the phone itself must be rooted
(Android) or jailbroken (iOS).
