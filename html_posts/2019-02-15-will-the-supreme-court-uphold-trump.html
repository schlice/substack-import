**Will the Supreme Court uphold Trump\'s declaration of emergency on the
Southern border? How long will it take for this case to reach the
Supreme Court?**

The Supreme Court cannot uphold or overturn the President's declaration
of a national emergency, because it is not a legal question.

The National Emergencies Act authorizes the President to declare
national emergencies and unlock the provisions of Federal law designated
for such emergencies. That's not a legal question. The law allows the
President to do this already. Congress already gave this authorization.
