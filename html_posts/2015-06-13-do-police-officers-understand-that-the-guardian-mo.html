**Content:** [No officer has to be taught that he is a Guardian. They
all know it, from the second they step foot in the Academy. \"Why are
you here?\" \"To protect and serve.\" Easy. Rolls off the tongue.\
\
However, the flip side of that is that while no one has to be taught to
be a Guardian, within the breast of each officer must inexorably beat
the heart of a Warrior. That Warrior must be ready to defend the people
he is sworn to defend. The Warrior spirit must be taught, molded, and
shaped. The extent to which that is done correctly will determine how
well an officer can control the Warrior, call it out when needed, and
stow it when not. That Warrior is the one thing that will keep him
alive. The officer may be the Guardian on the outside, but he\'s still a
Warrior on the inside.\
\
This is why many departments don\'t wear their ballistic vests on the
outsides of their uniform; they wear them (the sign of the Warrior)
underneath a nice, button-down shirt (the sign of the Guardian). How you
see your officers dress is an indication of whether or not they believe
themselves to be Guardian-first, or Warrior-first. Believe me, it\'s
uncomfortable, but if that\'s the image your department wants to
portray, they\'ll have their officers wearing their ballistic vests
underneath their shirts.]{.rendered_qtext}
