Before I answer your question, you need to understand how this app came
to be.

For years, police organizations around the world have been looking at
TOR and apps like Signal and Telegram, which provide their users
end-to-end encryption, and are exclusively used by criminals to hide
their planning for their crimes, and wondered how they can legally hack
these protocols. Clearly, while some piecemeal progress had been made
there, it was very limited, and it had (and still has today) very little
public support.

So the cops had a conversation amongst themselves. Here's an adaptation
of how that discussion went:

*"Hey, wouldn't it be cool if* ***we*** *built an encryption app that we
could monitor?"*

*"Yeah, that would be cool, but you know, we don't want honest people to
use it, so like, we don't want to put it out on the App Store or
anything like that."*

*"Yeah, okay, but we still need to make it sound legitimate to
criminals."*

*"OOO. I have an idea! Let's mod some Google devices, you know, remove
the cameras and voice capabilities, and only include the encrypted app
on them!"*

*"Yeah, and then we'll get some criminal influencers to vouch for the
device to their criminal buddies, and it will spread organically!"*

And that's exactly what they did. The ANOM app was only included on
specially-designed stripped-back Google Pixel devices. The devices had
no voice or camera functionality. Law enforcement provided more than 300
criminal syndicates in more than 100 different countries with about
12,000 devices. The French news agency AFP reported that the devices
containing the ANOM app were distributed over almost two years, allowing
agents to \"monitor their communications.\" Australian Federal Police
Commissioner Reece Kershaw said the communications were brazen with no
attempt to hide criminal plots using code words, according to the news
agency. \"We have been in the back pockets of organized crime,\" Kershaw
said. \"All they talk about is drugs, violence, hits on each other,
innocent people who are going to be murdered.\"

\"ANOM\'s distributors, administrators and agents had so much confidence
in the secrecy of their devices that they openly marketed them to other
potential users as designed by criminals for criminals,\" said Randy
Grossman, the acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of
California. \"But the devices were actually operated by the FBI.\"

When the global police organizations who were working on Operation
Trojan Shield were ready, they made busts:

- Australian authorities said they arrested 224 people and seized more
  than four tons of drugs and \$35 million in an ongoing operation that
  dates back three years. New Zealand police said they had arrested 35
  people and seized drugs and assets worth millions of dollars.
- The US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of California
  charged 17 foreign defendants who administered or distributed the
  devices with racketeering counts. Eight of the defendants were taken
  into custody Monday night, and the other nine are considered
  fugitives, officials said.
- Swedish police prevented a dozen planned killings and believe that
  they have arrested several \"leading actors in criminal networks,\"
  according to a statement from Linda Staaf, the head of Sweden\'s
  national criminal intelligence unit.
- Finnish police said Tuesday that nearly 100 people have been detained
  and more than 500 kilograms of drugs confiscated, along with dozens of
  guns and cash worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.
- German authorities said on Tuesday that police had arrested more than
  70 suspects and searched scores of sites as part of the global
  crackdown. The raids carried out on Monday were largely in the state
  of Hesse, according to the Frankfurt public prosecutors office. The
  Reuters news agency quoted the prosecutors office as saying police
  seized hundreds of pounds of narcotics, more than 20 weapons, dozens
  of luxury vehicles and more than \$250,000 worth of cash, as well as
  IT equipment. [\[1\]](#wexSs){#cite-wexSs .citation_link}

So, back to the original question. Here's your answer:

If you hold in your hand one of these devices and you were using the
ANOM app, and you're not in jail right now, you are either exceedingly
lucky or you just haven't been arrested yet. Because honestly, the only
people who had these devices and used them were, in fact, criminals.

If you happen to have one and you're not actually a criminal, hang on to
it for a year or so and then sell it on eBay because it will be a
collector's item and you'll make a lot of money on it. And by the way,
don't turn it on.

Original question:

**Can someone who was using the ANoM app but wasn\'t a criminal sue the
FBI for misrepresenting the app and reading their private messages?**
