Short answer: **no**.

The NRA does not write regulations for owning guns in the United States.
If you want to complain to someone for "lax regulations" (which I find
absolutely hysterical), complain to Congress. They write the laws, not
an affinity group of gun owners who also happens to have a lobbying arm
(NRA Institute for Legislative Action).

Any citizen or group, including the NRA, is entitled to express their
opinions about what government does, does not, should, or should not do.
This is the express purpose of the First Amendment.

Should I try to sue Everytown, USA when someone can't buy a gun because
regulations are too tight and then a robber kills them? Everytown, USA
is no more responsible for what a robber does than the NRA is
responsible for what the Las Vegas shooter did.
