**Specified Complexity.**

Jodie Foster played a scientist who worked for the organization Search
for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI) in the movie *Contact.* In the
movie, Foster gets extremely excited when her antenna picks up radio
waves that appear to have an intelligent pattern, "One, two, three,
five, seven, eleven...those are primes!" she exclaims (meaning prime
numbers). "That can't be natural phenomena!"

Indeed, random radio waves can be naturally produced, but those that
contain a message always have an intelligent source. Prime numbers, from
one to 101 in order, constitute a message that only comes from an
intelligent being.

Foster is so confident that ET has been found, she goes public with her
discovery. Government and military officials then converge on her
facility. "If this is such an intelligent source, then why don't they
just speak English?" one official asks with a hint of derision.

"Because math is the only universal language!" Foster fires back.

Of course she's right. In fact, alphabets, and thus language itself, can
be ultimately reduced to numbers. This is why the English alphabet is
mathematically identical to the genetic alphabet of DNA and why the
comparison of cell information to letters and sentences is a one-to-one
relationship rather than just an analogy.

While Foster and her colleagues later discover a more complicated
message embedded in the radio waves, they are absolutely certain the
prime numbers alone prove that the message came from intelligent life.
Why are they so certain of this? Because **repeated observation tells us
that only intelligent beings create messages and that natural laws never
do.** When we see a sequence of prime numbers, we realize that it
requires an intelligent cause. Another name for that message or
information is "specified complexity." In other words, not only is it
complex---it also contains a specific message.

\

So how does the presence of specified complexity prove the existence of
an intelligent Creator?

**DNA**.

DNA has a helical structure that looks like a twisted ladder. The sides
of the ladder are formed by alternating deoxyribose and phosphate
molecules, and the rungs of the ladder consist of a specific order of
four nitrogen bases. These nitrogen bases are adenine, thymine,
cytosine, and guanine, which commonly are represented by the letters A,
T, C, and G. These letters comprise what is known as the four-letter
genetic alphabet. This alphabet is identical to our English alphabet in
terms of its ability to communicate a message, except that the genetic
alphabet has only four letters instead of twenty-six. Just as the
specific order of the letters in this sentence communicates a unique
message, the specific order of A, T, C, and G within a living cell
determines the unique genetic makeup of that living entity.

Therefore, the message in DNA is not only complex, but it delivers a
message: it tells the entire cell how to function. **DNA is, therefore,
specified complexity.**

So where we are right now can be expressed in a logical statement:

- Only intelligent beings create specified complexity.
- DNA is specified complexity.
- Therefore, DNA was created by an intelligent being.

Now this says nothing *about* the intelligent being who created DNA. All
it says is that DNA was created by an intelligent being. This is a
logical conclusion and is scientifically supported by repeated
observation.

\

So thus far, we have proven that an intelligent being created us,
because we can prove that intelligence created DNA. But is there any
scientific principle we can use to learn *about* that intelligent being?
The answer is yes, there is. The forensic science principle known as the
Law of Causality says, in part, that an effect must resemble its cause.
Therefore, we can analyze the effect (us) in the present and learn about
the cause (the intelligent being who created us) in the past.

We can surmise the following about our intelligent creator (based on
characteristics of His creation):

- He must be supernatural in nature (as He created time and space).
- He must be powerful (incredibly).
- He must be eternal (self-existent).
- He must be necessary (the maker must be self-explanatory).
- He must be omnipresent (He created space and is not limited by it).
- He must be timeless and changeless (He created time).
- He must be immaterial because He transcends space/physical.
- He must be personal (the impersonal cannot create personality).
- He must be infinite and singular as you cannot have two infinite
  beings.
- He must be diverse yet have unity as unity and diversity exist in
  nature.
- He must be intelligent (supremely, as only cognitive being can produce
  cognitive being).
- He must be purposeful as He deliberately created everything.
- He must be moral (no moral law can be had without a giver).
- He must be caring (or no moral laws would have been given).

These things being true, we now ask if any religion in the world
describes such a Creator. The answer to this is yes: the God of the
Bible fits this profile perfectly. He is

- supernatural (Genesis 1:1),
- powerful (Jeremiah 32:17),
- eternal (Psalm 90:2),
- necessary (Exodus 3:14)
- omnipresent (Psalm 139:7),
- timeless/changeless (Malachi 3:6),
- immaterial (John 5:24),
- personal (Genesis 3:9),
- necessary (Colossians 1:17),
- infinite/singular (Jeremiah 23:24, Deuteronomy 6:4),
- diverse yet with unity (Matthew 28:19),
- intelligent (Psalm 147:4-5),
- purposeful (Jeremiah 29:11, Psalm 19:1-4),
- moral (Daniel 9:14), and
- caring (1 Peter 5:6-7).

Remember that we are using scientific observation to prove the existence
of an intelligent creator, so it is important to understand that, in
valid scientific fashion, this theory of Intelligent Design (ID) is
*falsifiable*. We are willing to abandon this whole notion of
intelligence creating specified complexity if natural processes are ever
shown to create it. However, the same *cannot* be said about the
Darwinist position. Darwinists don't allow falsification of their
"creation story" because they don't allow any other creation story to be
considered. Their "science" is not tentative or open to correction; it's
more closed-minded than the most dogmatic church doctrine the Darwinists
are so apt to criticize. In fact, Darwinists frequently say that
Intelligent Design is not science. Are they right?

Science is a search for causes, and there are only two types of causes:
intelligent and non-intelligent (natural). The Darwinists' claim that ID
is not science is based on their biased definition of science. But
that's circular logic: if your definition of science rules out
intelligent causes beforehand, then you'll never consider ID science.

The irony for the Darwinists is this: if ID is not science, then neither
is Darwinism. Why? Because both Darwinists and ID scientists are trying
to discover what happened in the past. Origin questions are forensic
questions, and thus require the use of the forensic science principles
we already have discussed (like the Law of Causality). In fact, for
Darwinists to rule out Intelligent Design from the realm of science, in
addition to ruling themselves out, they would also have to rule out
archaeology, cryptology, criminal and accident forensic investigations,
and the entire scientific process behind the organization portrayed by
Jodie Foster, SETI. These are all legitimate forensic sciences that look
into the past for intelligent causes. Therefore, something must be wrong
with the Darwinists' definition of science.
