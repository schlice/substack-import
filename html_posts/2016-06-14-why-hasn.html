I don't recall any mass shootings in recent years being perpetrated in
the name of "the NRA." I don't recall anyone storming into a nightclub
shouting, "The Second Amendment rules, baby!!!"

Maybe you can enlighten us and tell us which terror attacks in the
United States have been carried out by "the NRA" or in their name.

On the other hand, I can name a few terror attacks that were carried out
by al Qaeda, in their name, claimed by them, and officially endorsed by
them.

Do you see a difference here?

I can understand your dislike of the NRA. I'm not their biggest fans
either, but I can appreciate the work they do, as one of the strongest
supporters of our rights. They haven't perpetrated any killings. They
haven't taken credit for any killings. In fact, they have strongly
denounced killings while lobbying for the rights of law-abiding citizens
to arm themselves if they so choose. It is possible to both denounce
murder and advocate arms for law-abiding citizens.

Notice that the difference is the person behind the gun, not the gun
itself.
