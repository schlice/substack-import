Generally, in order for an HOA to be mandatory, it must exist prior to
homes being built on that property. It must be put in place by the
builder and included as part of the master agreement for using that
land.

Once the first house is sold without that agreement, in order to make a
mandatory HOA, you must have the agreement of a supermajority of the
homeowners. The builder can represent the interests of the unsold
properties, but in order to create a mandatory HOA when the builder does
not own all the property, you must have the approval of a supermajority
of the homeowners. If you only have a small number of homes sold, this
may not be difficult. But if you have many homes sold already, you may
not be able to create a mandatory HOA.

There have been instances in the past where one homeowner out of
hundreds who didn't want to be part of the HOA was excluded from its
provisions and remained outside of the HOA's control. But this is the
exception rather than the rule.

**TL;DR:** In other words, if the builder didn't set it up before he
started selling homes, in most cases he cannot force you to join. He can
create an *optional* HOA, but he cannot create a *mandatory* HOA.
