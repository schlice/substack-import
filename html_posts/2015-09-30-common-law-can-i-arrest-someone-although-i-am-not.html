**Content:** [Citizen\'s Arrest is an authority granted to a private
person to detain an individual who they witnessed performing a crime.
The citizen must have probable cause to effect the arrest.\
\
Almost all states have some form of citizen\'s arrest statute, and
almost all states differ in how they implement the statute. Some allow
you to perform arrests for any crime. Some only allow you to perform an
arrest for a felony. Some require verbal announcement before force is
used.\
\
It would have to be a really sketchy situation for me to jump in and
make a citizen\'s arrest.\
\
My advice: **be a good witness.** Try to capture as many details about
the situation as possible. Who was the person? What was he wearing? What
did he do? When did he do it? Where did he go? Did he get into a car?
Did he get on the bus? Did he run off somewhere?\
\
Most everyone has a cell phone with a camera these days. Maybe snap some
pictures or record some video. That\'s way more useful than trying to
effect a citizen\'s arrest.]{.rendered_qtext}
