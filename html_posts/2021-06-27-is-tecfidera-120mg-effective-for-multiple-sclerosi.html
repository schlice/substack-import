That's the starting dose for the drug: 120mg twice a day. After a week,
the drug gets bumped up to its maintenance dose: 240mg twice a day.

That said, temporary reductions of the dose down to the starting 120mg
may be considered for patients who can't tolerate the maintenance dose.
You'd run the 120mg dose for a week and then return back to the 240mg
dose. And if you can't stay on the 240mg dose, it's recommended that you
switch to another medication.

This should tell you one important thing: **staying on the 120mg dose
twice a day is not recommended because it is not as effective as the
maintenance dose.**

In other words, if you can't tolerate the 240mg dose (and if you can't,
you're not alone: close to 40% of people stopped taking Tecfidera
because of impactful side-effects), you should consider one of the other
MS therapy drugs. Talk to your neurologist about everything you are
experiencing while taking Tecfidera, and if you are unable to tolerate
the maintenance dose, perhaps together you can find an alternative
therapy.
