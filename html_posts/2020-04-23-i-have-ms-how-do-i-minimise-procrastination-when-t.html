**I have MS. How do I minimise procrastination when taking my
injections?**

Scheduling, and keeping that schedule.

When I was taking Copaxone Daily, I'd take it at night along with my
"getting ready for bed" routine. When you add your injections to one of
your normal routine, they become easier to take, you forget less, and
you don't mind them quite as much.
