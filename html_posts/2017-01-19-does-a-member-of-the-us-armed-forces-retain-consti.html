Every servicemember is subject to the Constitution as a citizen. But in
addition to the Constitution, they are also subject to the Uniform Code
of Military Justice (UCMJ), which is specifically tailored to handle
situations which would arise in the course of military service. For
example, insubordination is not covered by the Constitution, nor is it
covered in any Federal, state, or local laws. The UCMJ addresses
disciplinary actions which are specifically related to military service.

You never sign away any Constitutional rights when enlisting in the
military. You sign a contract which binds you to a certain length of
service. The military does this because it's not cheap to train someone.
Depending on the branch and the job, your training can run upwards of
\$250,000. The military would like to see some return on their
investment, so you are generally bound to a specific length of service.
You also must maintain military standards during your enlistment
(grooming, dress and personal appearance, weight, health standards,
conduct and character, etc).

Under Article 31 of the UCMJ, a military member has very similar rights
to what *Miranda* holds for civilians. Here is the statement of Article
31 rights:

> I am \_\_\_\_\_\_ (grade/name), a member of (AF Security
> Police/AFOSI), I am investigating the alleged offense(s) of
> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, of which you are suspected. I advise you that

Military members don't lose any Constitutional rights. They are simply
covered by a more restrictive set of rules which applies over and above
the Constitution.
