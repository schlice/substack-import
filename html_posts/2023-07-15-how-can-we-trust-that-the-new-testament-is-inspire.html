Ah, very good question! We often lump the New Testament in with the
whole Bible and say it's all God-breathed (which it is), but that does
not a logical proof make.

So what can we say specifically about the Bible that would convince us
that it (all of it, including the New Testament) is the inspired word of
God?

We know the Bible is inspired by God because Jesus said it is, and Jesus
is God.

And how do we know that Jesus is who He said He is?

We know Jesus is who He said He is because of three main reasons:

1.  He fulfilled many prophecies which were written about Himself
    thousands of years before He was born
2.  He lived a sinless life and performed miracles in the sight of many
    eyewitnesses, and we know that miracles can be used to confirm a
    message from God (acts of God confirm a word from God)
3.  He predicted, and then accomplished, his resurrection.

Therefore, since Jesus (who is God) taught that the Bible is the word of
God, it is true that the Bible (all of it) is the divinely inspired word
of God.
