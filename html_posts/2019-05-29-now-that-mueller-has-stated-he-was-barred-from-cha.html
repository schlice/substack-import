**Now that Mueller has stated he was barred from charging President
Trump, should Congress proceed with impeachment?**

Mueller didn't need to say this. It was in the introduction of Volume II
of his report. So for anyone who bothered to read the whole Mueller
report (yes, I'm looking at you, Congress), it was already stated in
there. But he re-iterated it again today. He didn't recommend charges
because you can't charge a sitting president. He said, specifically,
regarding the opinion he gave in the report:

> *First, the opinion \[...\] explicitly permits the investigation of a
> sitting president because it is important to preserve evidence while
> memories are fresh and documents available. Among other things, that
> evidence could be used if there were co-conspirators who could be
> charged now.*
>
> *And second, the opinion says that the Constitution requires a process
> other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting
> president of wrongdoing.*[\[1\]](#TNBjq){#cite-TNBjq .citation_link}

We've said all along that Congress' remedy is impeachment, not
re-investigating the Mueller investigation. Mueller made it **crystal
clear** today by re-iterating what's already in his written report that
if Congress wants to act, they must impeach.

If they want to open an impeachment inquiry, they should pass a
resolution stating so, and get to the business of impeachment.

So yes, Congress should either shit or get off the pot. Either impeach
him, or leave it alone and get back to making laws.
