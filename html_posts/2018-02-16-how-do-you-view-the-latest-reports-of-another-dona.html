It was handled at the time. A "payoff for silence" is an agreement
between two parties. One agrees not to move forward, the other agrees to
give them a pile of money. Takes two to tango here. She accepted that
money and agreed to not pursue further action or to discuss the issue
further. So I guess it was settled for her, wasn't it.

An **affair** is a lot different from a **sexual assault**. So yeah, I
view them completely differently. The results of an affair are between a
husband and his wife. And while sexual assault is a criminal activity,
an affair is not.

We as a nation already knew Trump played it a little loose with the
women. We all heard the *Access Hollywood* tape. And we elected him
anyway. How does this change anything at all?

These days, we call this a "political nothingburger."
