**Content:** [You are falling into the trap that the media is
perpetuating: the police need to be feared because they look fearsome.\
\
First, to answer your question, the Posse Comitatus Act prevents the
U.S. government from using the military against the population. Just
because the police have to become increasingly \"militarized\" in order
to protect themselves against growing threats does not make them \"the
military.\" They still work for the Chief of Police, the Sheriff, or the
Governor. While part of the Executive branch of government, they all
ultimately work for the President, but only the military works for the
Commander-in-Chief. See the difference? So you\'ll never see the US Army
write you a speeding ticket. But some fancy bulletproof uniforms and
vehicles do not make the police into the military, and thus unable to do
their jobs under Posse Comitatus.\
\
Now, on to the meat of what you\'re getting at. The police have become
more militarized over the last 50 years. But that\'s not because of some
national conspiracy to make the police into some state military. It\'s
in response to the growing threats against the police. The past few
months have only proven that those threats are real, and only need a
push to set some people off.\
\
Times are tough for cops right now. It\'s up to all of us to counter
these threats with **reason** and **logic** and **compassion**, not
threats and fear.]{.rendered_qtext}
