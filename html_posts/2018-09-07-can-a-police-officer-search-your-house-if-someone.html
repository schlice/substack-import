**Can a police officer search your house if someone else signs a paper,
giving them permission, who doesn\'t reside with you when you\'re in
jail?**

In the vast majority of jurisdictions, any person over 18 who is in the
house can give permission for police to search the house. The homeowner
listed on the deed does not need to be the person who admits the police.
It merely needs to be **the person who is in control of the property.**

Consent is legal when police wish to search a house.

If the house is shared (i.e. you have a roommate), the police can search
*common areas* and any areas controlled by the grantor, but he cannot
allow access into your locked areas. If the whole house is a common
area, then the person in control of the property can authorize the
search of the whole house.
