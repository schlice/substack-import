**Should Trump impose 'Martial Law' on border to stop migrant caravan?**

He cannot stop the migrant caravan. Until they reach the border.

Once they try to enter the country illegally, they can be arrested and
deported.

But yes, he can impose a kind of "martial law" at the border to make
deportations easier. Martial law in the United States is primarily the
suspension of *habeas corpus*, which is essentially the judicial
branch's oversight of law enforcement. What Trump can do is to change
one immigration rule: illegal immigrants cannot ask for political asylum
when they entered the country illegally. Potential refugees can ask for
asylum while outside of the country (at a US embassy), while at a US
border crossing, or while *legally* present in the country (i.e. on a
tourist visa), or for up to one year after entering the country legally,
even if that status has since changed to an unlawful one.

However, streamlining the caravan's return to wherever they came from
would be helped by removing the rule which allows illegal immigrants to
claim asylum, which sets off a sometimes months-long procedure whereby
the claims of political or religious persecution must be investigated.
