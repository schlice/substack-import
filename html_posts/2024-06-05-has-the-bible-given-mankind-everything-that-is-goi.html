No, the Bible has not listed ***everything*** that is going to happen in
the future. The Bible lists ***the most significant things to our
eternity*** that will happen in the future.

The book of Revelation is the last book in the Bible. It details a
period of time where the apostle John was exiled to the island of
Patmos, and while he was there, God showed him a vision of the future.,
the events which are to come, at the time when Christ returns.

The book details what will happen in the lead-up to this event, the
coming of the Antichrist, the "mark of the beast," and Jesus' return and
destruction of Satan.
