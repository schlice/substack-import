So sorry Paul, I'm stealing your tagline. Here's *the rest of the
story.*

On the *All-In* podcast, which is a Silicon Valley podcast which
discusses all things tech, angel investor Jason Calacanis told Trump
that the U.S. needs to be able to legally retain more high-skilled
workers, a problem which has affected nearly the entire tech industry.

\"Can you please promise us you will give us more ability to import the
best and brightest around the world to America?\" Calacanis said.

\"I do promise,\" Trump said. \"But I happen to agree, otherwise I
wouldn\'t promise\... You graduate from a college, I think you should
get automatically as part of your diploma a green card to be able to
stay in this country and that includes junior colleges too.\"

This, of course, threw everyone into a tizzy. Like our questioner here,
people were asking, "What happened to *America First*?" And what will
this mean, specifically? Like, is it *any* person who graduates from
*any* college? What if you're an illegal immigrant who was allowed to
complete college under some crazy Federal grant?

The Trump campaign quickly responded, adding more details to Trump's
statement. They said that only after \"the most aggressive vetting
process in U.S. history\" would \"the most skilled graduates who can
make significant contributions to America\" be able to stay.

So Trump didn't really elaborate on the podcast about the idea, but his
campaign did. And it's not a terrible idea. If valid student visa
holders graduate from US colleges in fields in which we desperately need
to retain, it only makes sense to open a pathway to citizenship. This
encourages people to come to the US on valid student visas and graduate
into career fields which we want to retain, and only after we have
vetted them properly. This indicates that they are not here illegally,
and they have truly been vetted.

This, actually, is the right way to do immigration. How can I say that?
It's literally what ***every other first-world country on this planet
does.*** You are vetted before you can become a citizen, and part of
that vetting determines *what benefit you can bring to that country*.
Surely, no country willingly wants to import someone who would simply be
a drain on social resources. Don't believe me? Try becoming a Canadian
citizen. Really. Check out the website which discusses naturalizing as a
Canadian citizen.

So rather than following the Democrat playbook (see a small problem,
turn to a one-size-fits-all mega-solution which hurts more than it
helps), Trump is offering a way forward for the types of immigrants who
will benefit the United States to more easily become citizens.

It's an *olive branch*, and it's a way for Trump to appeal to those
single-issue voters who believe he is anti-immigrant. He's never been
anti-immigrant. He's always been anti-*illegal* immigrant. And he's
proving that he actually does care about legal immigration.
