The short and surprising answer is **yes, Beavis and Butt-Head would be
able to make it into Heaven**.

But just like everyone else, they would need to do the needful:
**repent** and **believe**.

They would have to **repent** from their carnally-minded ways. This
means they'd have to *turn away* from sin, and stop doing
self-destructive things. They'd have to stop doing *literally whatever
pops into their heads at that very moment*. That's the perfect
illustration of someone who fulfills the desires of the flesh. If they
think of it, they do it, no matter how idiotic it may seem. They'd have
to repent of that, and be sorry for what they have done.

Then, they'd have to believe that Christ died for their sins. Knowing
what they did which was in controversion to God's will, they'd have to
believe that there was One who came and died to be the penal
substitution for them. They'd have to know that He died for them. They
would have to accept Him as their Lord and Savior.

Clearly, that would be bad for MTV, because they wouldn't really be
Beavis and Butt-Head any more, and the show would get kinda boring.

But it would be good for them and their eternal destiny, would it not?

This thought question often comes up which illustrates this point:

**Would Hitler be in Heaven if he truly repented on his deathbed and
believed in the salvific power of Christ?**

Would you be surprised if you heard that the answer was **yes?** There
is no one whose deeds are *so bad* that they cannot be forgiven, if they
repent and believe.

Remember though, this doesn't mean that we live our lives in sin,
***knowing*** that we can repent on our deathbeds. That's not how this
works. If you know about God and His plan for us, and you *knowingly
live otherwise, claiming that you'll just apologize later*, that is not
living as a saved person would live. Saved people do not make bargains
with God so that they can continue to live in sin.

TL;DR: While it would ruin the show, Beavis and Butt-Head could indeed
go to Heaven if they repent and believe, just like anyone else.
