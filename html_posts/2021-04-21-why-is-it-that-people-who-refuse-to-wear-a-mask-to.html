I'm going to address this question from another angle:

*Where did you find in state law, federal law, or the Constitution,
wherein you have the* ***right*** *to be free from infection by a
virus?*

You certainly have the right to be free from someone ***knowingly***
infecting you with a virus. If you have unprotected sex with someone who
later tells you that they have AIDS and they knew it at the time, you
have a case. Similarly, if someone who has tested positive for COVID and
is in active infection is running around maskless, coughing on people,
they get arrested for assault as well.

But most people who don't wear masks (except for asymptomatic carriers)
are not knowingly, intentionally infecting anyone, and in such a case,
there is no right to not be infected with a virus. You are absolutely
free to go somewhere else where there is an enforced mask policy. There
are very few places you are required to be where there is no enforced
mask policy. In fact, in the United States, there are very few places
you are *required* to be at all.

And what about people who are fully vaccinated? Are you seriously
concerned that one of them is an asymptomatic carrier, just randomly
infecting people? If the vaccine won't prevent the spread of the virus,
what will? It's certainly not masks. Yes, they help, but they are not
guaranteed. Fully 70% of people who were infected reported that they
frequently or always wore their masks in public.

So if wearing masks won't do it, and getting vaccinated won't do it, at
what point do we stop being paranoid and get back to real life?

Original question:

Why is it that people who refuse to wear a mask to safeguard against
COVID-19 & are so concerned about their right to choose not to have
little or no regard for the rights of other Americans who do not want to
contract COVID-19 from maskless people?
