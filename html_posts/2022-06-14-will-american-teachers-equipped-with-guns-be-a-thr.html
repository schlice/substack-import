Not in the slightest.

In fact, with the proper training, teachers can be that first line of
defense for their students. A training program called FASTER
(***F***aculty & ***A***dministrator ***S***afety ***T***raining and
***E***mergency ***R***esponse) has been developed and is being deployed
in multiple states.

This is the new reality. Yes, teachers with guns will save lives. No,
they will not be more of a threat to their students than unarmed
teachers.
