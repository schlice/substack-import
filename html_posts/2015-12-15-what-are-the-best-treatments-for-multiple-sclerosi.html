The best treatment for MS is the one that works the best for the
patient.

First, not all MS medications are indicated for use in all forms of MS.
Most of the disease modifying drugs (DMDs) available today treat the
disease by managing inflammation caused by the disease process.
Normally, inflammation is only present in relapsing/remitting forms of
the disease. Progressive forms of the disease do not present
inflammation as the mechanism of action; they present a steady
neurodegeneration, so the traditional DMDs are ineffective (for the most
part) against progressive forms of the disease.

However, for relapsing forms of the disease, each medication works a
little bit differently, but they all accomplish the same things: they
reduce the severity of relapses, they increase the amount of time
between relapses, and they slow the disease action in the brain.

Moreover, each medication works differently in each patient. Some people
respond well to synthetics like Copaxone, others find no benefit from
such medications. Some people benefit from beta-blockers (interferons)
like Avonex, Betaseron, Rebif, and similar, some only get the side
effects, but don\'t see any significant improvement in disease activity.
So there is a little bit of \"trial and error\" with the medications.

Basically, as a patient, you have to consider a few factors, namely the
efficacy of the medicine (how well it works) and the method of
administration (how you take it). There are three administration methods
available today:

- injection
- infusion
- oral

The injectables are either sub-cutaneous (SC), which means \"under the
skin,\" or intra-muscular (IM), which means \"in the muscle.\"
Betaseron, Rebif, and Copaxone are SC, and Avonex is IM. Betaseron and
Copaxone are taken every other day, Rebif is taken three times a week.
Avonex is once a week. Copaxone used to be daily, but the dosing
protocol and dosage have changed. Tysabri is available by infusion every
four weeks at an infusion center. The orals are taken daily; Gilenya,
Tecfidera, and Aubagio are some examples of the orals available today.

Once you decide on a method of administration, you need to look at the
efficacy (how well it works) and decide if a drug with another method of
administration might be more effective, and then you need to decide
which is more important to you: the method by which you take the
medicine, or how effective it is against the disease. You may choose to
sacrifice a little efficacy for a more acceptable method of
administration. Or you may not care so much about the administration,
but you want the most effective medicine you can get. It\'s a balancing
act.

Ultimately, you and your neurologist will need to decide together which
medicine will be best for you.
