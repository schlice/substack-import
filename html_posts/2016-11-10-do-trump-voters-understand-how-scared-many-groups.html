*(Full disclosure: I voted for Trump, but remember I'm a law guy, so my
main issue was the future composition of the Supreme Court, and I vote
for policy, not personality)*

I think if you don't understand how scared some Americans are, you only
need to turn on the TV and look at the mainstream media outlets showing
protests and rioting in New York, LA, and Chicago. Interestingly enough,
the protests are **all** taking place in areas which voted for Clinton.
There are no protests taking place anywhere where a majority of voters
voted for Trump. I wonder if there is a correlation. Not to say that
it's all Democrats that are protesting, but let's be honest with
ourselves, it is.

But it's also just as important to understand that ***conservatives felt
exactly as you feel today when President Obama was elected***. We were
scared that social programs would outpace job creation (it did), we were
scared that taxes would rise in response (it did), we were afraid that
socialist principles would guide policy (it did), and as a result, we
got stimulus plans (throwing money at a problem instead of fixing the
root of it) and Obamacare (also throwing money at a problem instead of
fixing it). Most of our fears were realized, some were not. You should
also note that none of our fears had anything to do with the color of
his skin, and everything to do with his policies. I was perfectly ready
for a black president, just not *that* one. The point I'm trying to
make: many of our fears are not really fears at all, but are concerns
about the future direction of the country, which is not in line with our
own beliefs about the best direction for the country.

You should also note that ***not a single conservative rioted or
protested*** after Obama was elected (twice). I wonder if that's telling
at all. (EDIT: there was a small protest at the University of
Mississippi in 2012 after Mr. Obama was re-elected, but it was hardly
anything to move the needle in comparison to what we are seeing today).

Ultimately, while everyone's feelings are important, everyone's feelings
matter, and I do understand that some people are nervous, scared, etc.,
I believe those feelings are unfounded for a number of reasons:

- **The President, while setting the** ***tone*, doesn't actually make**
  ***law*.** Yes it's true, the President sets the tone for his
  administration. He has a number of priorities that he wants to
  accomplish during his first 100 days. On his first day, he pledged to:
  - Repeal and replace 'Obamacare,'
  - Immediately suspend the admission of Syrian refugees
  - Order a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight
    years, and begin lifting all regulations that are hurting our
    workers and our businesses
  - Terminate every single unconstitutional executive order signed by
    President Obama, thus restoring the rule of law to our land
  - Begin implementing plans for construction of a wall along our
    southern border
  - Get rid of international gangs of thugs and drug cartels

...and that's all on Day 1. During the subsequent 99 days, he said he
would:

- - "Drain the Swamp" - the colloquial term for rooting out corruption
    in Washington
  - Get the ball rolling on a "constitutional amendment to impose term
    limits on all members of Congress."
  - Get a law started barring government officials from lobbying the
    government within five years of their service and prohibiting
    lobbying by those officials on behalf of foreign governments.
  - Institute a hiring freeze in order to reduce the size of the federal
    government.
  - Institute campaign finance reform by forbidding foreign lobbyists
    from raising money on behalf of campaigns in the U.S.
  - Renegotiate NAFTA and withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership
    (TPP)
  - Renegotiate the Iran nuclear deal
  - Call a NATO summit to update their mission and re-balance members
    "financial commitments"
  - Cancel payments to the UN Commission on Climate Change and its
    associated programs, diverting that money to domestic infrastructure
    improvements
  - Increase investment in the US military
  - Be "unpredictable" when fighting ISIS in the Middle East
  - Implement "the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan"
  - Increase police training and create a task force on violent crime
    (note: we already have such a task force, but perhaps he could
    bolster it)
  - Eliminate Common Core
  - Immediately move to nominate a Supreme Court justice to replace
    Antonin Scalia.

That's a pretty exhaustive list. But realistically, how many of these
can he do ***on his own***? Very few, in fact. He can modify and undo
Executive Orders, as they are nothing more than orders directing the
Executive branch of the government how to implement their directives. He
can change those just as easily as they were implemented (live by the
executive order, die by the executive order). He can call a NATO summit,
he can nominate a Supreme Court justice, and he can modify immigration
policy, all on his own, under the law. **Everything else** requires the
support and action of Congress. So he's not some rogue maverick who is
going to upend the world. Congress has to act in order to accomplish the
vast majority of this plan. So it's telling that this is the first time
since Grover Cleveland was president that a Republican had a unified
government to actually implement some of these things. Admittedly,
understanding that this is the first time the Republicans have had a
real chance to implement some of their ideas, you might be a little
worried. I'm nervous, but it's more of a nervous excitement to see what
a unified Republican government can truly accomplish.

- **Regardless of how you feel or how you voted, the sun will come out
  tomorrow.** To quote the song, yes, the sun will come out tomorrow. We
  will all get up, go to work, feed our kids, wash our cars, water our
  lawns, and generally go about our lives unaffected by what happens in
  Washington. We put a lot of stock in the presidency, probably way more
  than we should.
- **The President cannot undo laws**. Some people are afraid that Trump
  will "overturn *Obergefell* and overturn *Roe*." Neither of these
  things are further from the truth. The president cannot undo a law.
  There are only three ways a law can be changed:\
  \
  - Congress can write a new law which nullifies the first law\
  - Congress can repeal the law\
  - The court can rule the law unconstitutional, thus nullifying it.\
  \
  The SCOTUS is unlikely to change any of its decisions, because its
  political makeup will be exactly the same under Trump as it was when
  these decisions were passed down. Remember that Scalia was a strict
  constructionist, Trump will be nominating a strict constructionist. So
  the same court makeup that brought you *Obergefell* will be the same
  makeup after Trump nominates a replacement for Scalia. There are no
  plans to overturn *Obergefell;* any challenge to the law will likely
  not have cert granted, as a decision has already been made.
- **Many of the fears are based on things that Trump was asked during
  the course of the campaign**, and many of those questions were just
  silly and misleading, trying to miscategorize candidate Trump. Do you
  remember when the headline came out that Trump would punish a woman
  for having an abortion? I do. But not many remember ***the question he
  was asked***. He was specifically asked, "***If we made abortion
  illegal***, would you support penalties for a woman who had an
  abortion?" This is one of those dirty, underhanded questions you ask
  someone so you can get a sound bite you can quote later on and bash
  someone with. Trump's answer: Of course, if you made it illegal, of
  course you would have penalties for having an abortion. Duh. And they
  (conveniently) omitted the question, and only reported the answer. An
  experienced politician would have seen that trick question for what it
  was. Trump, being a businessman (not an experienced politician),
  didn't.
- **Trump knows that he doesn't know everything**. He knows plenty. But
  he doesn't know everything. We tend to ask a lot of our president, but
  in fairness, *we shouldn't expect a leader to know everything*. We
  should expect a leader to *delegate* to the smart people to get the
  job done. We expect the leader to set the tone and drive the agenda.
  We expect his staff to do the heavy lifting of actually implementing
  things. If you've seen some of his potential choices for his cabinet,
  you'll also see that he wants to surround himself with some of the
  brightest minds he can in order to accomplish his agenda.
- **Trump has already shown that he can act presidential**, even if he
  doesn't do it every minute of the day. He has met with foreign leaders
  and no international incidents occurred. He has met with our current
  sitting president, and they had a long conversation about many topics,
  including the smooth transition of power between two diametrically
  opposed political parties. This is a hallmark of society in the United
  States: the peaceful transition of governments.

Be proud that our leaders have stated publicly, many times, that the
election is over and we need to get behind our new government and
support it and play a part in it. Hillary said it in her concession
speech: we have an obligation to take part in our government, not just
every four years, but every day.

Do you think that *protests* are the best way to accomplish that? Do you
think that clogging city streets, holding signs and chanting are going
to get your viewpoint across? It's probably less effective than you
think. You're probably better off lobbying your elected officials:
calling their offices, emailing them, attending roundtables with them,
etc. Make your opinion and your voice heard, but do it in the most
effective way possible. Your representatives in government represent
***you, regardless of your political beliefs***. Work *with* them.
Support them, keep them informed on issues that affect you. They need to
know, as it helps them shape policy.

Remember too that not everything will work out the way you want it to.
