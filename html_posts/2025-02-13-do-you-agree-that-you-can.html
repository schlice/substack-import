As always, with every legal question, the answer is "it depends."

In the United States, Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides
protection based on race, color, religion, or national origin, but it
doesn\'t explicitly include sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation.
Because there is no national standard with respect to sex discrimination
in public accommodations, businesses must rely on state statutes in the
majority of cases.

State rules about sex-separated private venues vary depending upon what
each state considers a "public accommodation." Many cities and states
have laws which protect gender, as well as some states which protect
gender identity, in a place of public accommodation (like libraries,
movie theaters, shops, and other businesses which are open to the
public). But those laws vary widely by state.

And in most cases, private clubs, which are not open to the general
public, are not considered places of public accommodation, and are
usually exempt from public accommodation laws.
