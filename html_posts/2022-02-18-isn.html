Yes, it certainly would be strange...if it were true.

Would you happen to have a tally of "offenses" committed by each that
you might be able to share with us?

Then, after you do that, ask yourself: *by whose standards are you
judging "offenses?"* Are they *your* standards? The standards of today's
society? Or are they God's standards?

In other words, it's up to you to declare the source of your morality, a
morality which must apply equally to God and man, such that you can find
God lacking.

Original question:

Isn\'t it strange that the benevolent God actually commits more offenses
than the evil Satan throughout the Bible?
