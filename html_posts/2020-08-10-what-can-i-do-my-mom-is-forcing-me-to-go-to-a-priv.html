**What can I do? My mom is forcing me to go to a private school in NY I
have been goin to public school my whole life and if I dont go shes
threatening to take money out of my bank account to pay for the
school.**

Realistically what can you do? Nothing.

So what's the best you can hope for? Sit down with your parents and talk
about what it is that worries you about going to private school. Is it
the fact that you're going to miss your friends? Maybe you can work out
an arrangement where you meet up with your old friends at sporting
events (if we ever have those again) or even planned after-school
activities.

Whatever the case may be, sitting down and having a discussion with your
parents about what it is that concerns you is going to be really
important. Even if they say "we don't care, you're going and that's
final," at least you've made your voice heard and they are at least
aware of your concerns. At best, maybe there are some changes they can
make to other things around you house that concern you to make your
transition a little easier.

And while it's little comfort right now, know that you will make new
friends who are all in exactly the same boat as you, and between you and
me, you're going to be better off than your peers in public school.
You'll get a better education and you'll be better prepared to get a job
when you leave school. You'll see: you'll be getting the jobs and they
will still be waiting to get a job. I know you're not even thinking that
far ahead, so take it from those of us who have been in your shoes
before.

I was literally in your shoes: I went to public school all the way until
high school and then my parents sent me to an all-boys Catholic school.
It was hard for me because my school was 30 minutes away from my house,
and with traffic that could be an hour commute just to get to school. If
I took the bus on the way home, with all the other stops, I'd be getting
home at like 7:30 at night after practice after riding the 6:00 PM
activity bus (when I wasn't driving yet). I'd get home, eat some dinner,
do some homework, and head straight to bed. It was not an easy run, but
I slogged through it and it set me up for success. I can promise you
that you will get out of it what you put in to it. The Latin phrase is
*quid pro quo*: you get out what you put in.

And it may start off challenging, but it will get easier.

You should also recognize that you're not the only one inconvenienced
here. Private school isn't free. Well neither is public school, but
public school is at least paid for out of your parents' taxes, where
private school is paid for separately. So your parents are making a
financial sacrifice to send you to private school.

Remember: you attract more flies with a teaspoon of honey than with a
gallon of vinegar. Sit down calmly with them and lay out your concerns
and see if they can help you with any of them. It will make the
transition so much easier.

Good luck!
