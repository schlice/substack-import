As long as the morning after pill *delays ovulation* (thereby preventing
sperm and egg from joining), and doesn't work like some of them say it
does, by preventing a fertilized egg from attaching to the uterine wall,
then it should be perfectly acceptable to pro-life groups.

The fact that it is not says more about those pro-life groups than it
does about the pill at all.

If you are intellectually honest about your pro-life beliefs, then the
morning after pill *which delays ovulation* is acceptable as a form of
birth control.
