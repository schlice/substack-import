I think you may be missing the forest for the trees.

It may be true that the majority of violent crime is perpetrated by men.
This may also be because, biologically, men tend to be more aggressive
than women. On balance, men have more testosterone than estrogen, and we
know that testosterone can increase aggressive behavior.

So what you've noted is a well-known feature of human physiology, not a
way by which we can address the problem of violence in society.

We still need to focus on the drivers of violence in general in society,
rather than looking at gender roles in who perpetuates that violence.
