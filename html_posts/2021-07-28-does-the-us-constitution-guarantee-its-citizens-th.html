Let's answer the Constitutional questions:

> **Does the U.S. Constitution guarantee its citizens the right to allow
> themselves to get sick**

The Constitution is not about what people are allowed to do. The
Constitution is all about what **government** is or is not allowed to
do.

The Constitution, additionally, does not grant or revoke rights. The
rights existed before the Constitution was written.

That said, the Constitution does not prohibit citizens from allowing
themselves to get sick. There is no right to not get sick.

> **and possibly others in the process?**

So here's where things get sticky. The Constitution is not the place for
this type of prohibition. The place for this is in *law*. Laws exist so
that my free exercise of my rights doesn't interfere with your free
exercise of your rights.

*And nowhere in the Constitution is there a right to not get sick.*
States have prohibitions on *intentionally* infecting others with
communicable diseases, but that's more under the "assault" banner than
it is because of any right to be free from illness.

That said, states have a responsibility to promote the public health,
and the federal government has the responsibility to promote the general
welfare. So there is a compelling state interest in designing public
health policy that allows people their freedom of choice while still
giving them all of the information they need to make an informed
decision about what healthcare options they should choose.

**Over the course of this "pandemic," the government has failed to do
this.**

Nevertheless, this is not a Constitutional question. The Constitution
does not prohibit anyone from allowing themselves to get sick, and
nowhere does it guarantee anyone the right to never get sick.

*Sorry, no comments on this one. Waaaaaay too much acrimony, and too
many people pushing this sickening condescension towards people with
legitimate concerns regarding vaccine skepticism.*

*If you don't like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is
grammatically low-quality or un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,
downvote it. If you think I'm wrong, write your own answer. But Quora is
a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply going
to comment to tell me "ackshually, you're wrong," then youre the reason
why I disable comments. Well done, Karen. You ruined it for everyone.*
