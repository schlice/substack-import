**Are multiple sclerosis patients more vulnerable to progressive
multifocal leukoencephalopathy?**

Let me see if I can provide an updated answer.

As everyone has already said, MS by itself does not increase your risk
of contracting PML. However, certain medications commonly prescribed for
MS can increase your risk of developing PML.

So there are two factors involved in a person with MS developing PML:

1.  Taking certain MS medications which are immunosuppressive
2.  Having been exposed to the [[JC
    Virus](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6a2af9&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JC_virus){.external_link
    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
    qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} and thus being "JC
    Positive."

Currently,
[[Tysabri](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c18f05&url=http://www.tysabri.com){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="tysabri.com"}]{.qlink_container} is the primary medication
which has been correlated with an increased risk of contracting PML. In
fact, Tysabri was pulled from the market when it was directly related to
three deaths from PML. Tysabri was re-released with a [[black box
warning](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=fa2f55&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxed_warning){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} about PML and Tysabri.
Continued study found that there was a much higher risk of developing
PML when you had multiple MS medications in your body at the same time.
So if you are going on to, or leaving, Tysabri as a therapy, you will
find that they will force you to be medication free for at least four
weeks (and possibly more) before you can start Tysabri, or before you
can start a new medication.

However, you can only develop PML as a result of the JC Virus, so if you
are JC negative, the Tysabri restrictions will not apply to you. You can
be sure that if you start or while you're on Tysabri, your doctor will
monitor you very closely for any signs of the JC virus. Interestingly,
Biogen (the maker of Tysabri) universally pays for JC virus testing. In
fact, they encourage it. If you're JC positive, you can still take
Tysabri, but the therapy may be cut short since the risk of developing
PML increases over time. This is something you'll want to work out with
your neurologist, and determine the amount of risk that applies to you
in your given situation. I'll tell you from personal experience that
Tysabri worked better than anything I've ever been on. In fact, it
worked so well that my body was able to heal some of my lesions. I've
only had lesions shrink while I was on Tysabri. Indeed, the efficiacy of
Tysabri is higher than any other MS medication out there.

Risk of PML has also been shown with
[[Gilenya](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4825b8&url=http://www.gilenya.com){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="gilenya.com"}]{.qlink_container}, but not as tightly
correlated as with Tysabri. In 2012, one case of a person taking Gilenya
developing PML was reported, but this was classified as a "carryover"
from previous Tysabri treatment. In 2015, three cases of Gilenya
patients contracting PML were reported who were not previously treated
with Tysabri. I moved to Gilenya from Tysabri, and my doctor continues
to do JC virus tests on me, as I have been, and continue to be, JC
negative.
