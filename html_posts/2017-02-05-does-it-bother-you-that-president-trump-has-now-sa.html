**Not at all.**

I think we need to ask ourselves why we want the president to release
his tax returns. "Because everyone else did" is not a good enough
answer. What other reasons could you want to see his returns? Are you
trying to catch him in a "lie?" Perhaps he is richer than he says he is.
Perhaps he is poorer. Perhaps he has given more money to charity than he
said. Perhaps he has given less. It may have helped vet candidate Trump,
because you could have seen his true amount of charitable giving, the
amount he invests, and his effective tax rate.

At this point, I don't really care what's on his tax returns. Frankly,
that information is between Trump and the IRS. If the IRS doesn't have a
problem with his tax returns, then I don't either.

And, I understand, he was being audited. So the IRS was trying to
determine whether or not they had a problem with his tax returns. I
haven't even heard whether or not they finished that audit.

Nevertheless, there is no requirement in the Constitution for a
candidate to release their tax returns.

*But every candidate since the Neanderthals has been releasing their tax
returns! Why can't he do it too?*

It's true, every candidate since Nixon (except for Gerald Ford) has
voluntarily released his tax returns.

*So why did Trump have such a problem with it? Is there something shady
in there? Perhaps something the IRS missed?*

I'm going to let you in on a little "political insider" secret.
**Politicians structure their finances so that they can make their tax
returns public**.

Yep, it's all staged.

They use high-powered CPAs and tax attorneys to help them structure
their finances and employ other tax strategery in order to make their
taxes appear "acceptable" to Americans. They do this because they know
they have to release their returns.

Trump has never done this. He's been a businessman, working with sums of
money that you and I could only dream of. If you compared his taxes to
the taxes of a politician, whose do you think would look "worse?"

At this point in time, you should be asking yourself (much like Hillary
asked about Benghazi), "What difference does it make?" The reason it
makes no difference is that he was elected without revealing his tax
statements. To me, this means that the people who elected him don't
really care about the fact that he didn't release his tax statements.

Very few politicians since Nixon, who was the first to do it, have been
elected without doing so. Every Republican since Nixon, with the
exception of President Ford, has released his tax statements. But Trump
was elected without revealing his tax returns, which leads me to believe
that people don't really care about Trump's taxes. We leave that to the
IRS, since they've made themselves so self-important when it comes to
vetting taxes, and they've repeatedly stated that taxes are between the
taxpayer and the IRS.

So let them handle it.

*But shouldn't we know?*

If you really believe we should know, lobby your Congressional
representatives. Get them to propose a Constitutional amendment, using
this "outrage" over Trump's failure to release his tax returns, and add
a requirement to reveal tax returns. Allow the IRS to do it once you
submit your statement of intent for candidacy. Then you could go to the
IRS website and see the candidate's tax history, if it's so important to
you. And if there are so many people who agree with you (well, more than
half of the voters numerically voted for Hillary, so maybe there's
momentum there), perhaps you can get 38 states to vote for that
amendment.

**And the candidate who gets elected will be the one who has the best
CPAs working their taxes to make their returns look the
squeaky-cleanest.**

If Trump knew twenty years ago that he was going to be running for
president, he would have structured his finances so that they look good
on a 1040. But Trump isn't a politician.

Until such time as we amend the Constitution to require candidates for
president to release their tax returns, that information is between the
taxpayer and the IRS. If the IRS doesn't have a problem with the
candidate's returns, then neither do I.
