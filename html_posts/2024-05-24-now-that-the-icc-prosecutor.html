In most cases, nothing.

If the warrant is granted, Netanyahu will not turn himself over. Israel
is not a party to the ICC (neither is Russia, China, or the US, by the
way). But *in theory,* if Netanyahu were to travel to one of the 124
countries that did sign on to the ICC, they would have to arrest him and
extradite him to the court for trial, which is in The Hague. Doing so
would be a politically fraught move and we wonder if it would actually
happen. I bet Netanyahu wouldn't tempt fate though, and would just steer
clear of those countries.

Israel can send a delegation to the ICC to challenge the charges against
Netanyahu, and they may do that.

The move would also weaken the ICC in the eyes of the world, as it would
put Netanyahu on par with other world leaders who have open arrest
warrants from the ICC against them, such as Russian President Vladmir
Putin, and the late Colonel Muammar Gaddafi of Libya. Putin faces an
arrest warrant for the unlawful deportation and transfer of children
from Ukraine to Russia. Before he was killed by his own people,
Gaddafi's arrest warrant was for murder and persecution of unarmed
civilians. While it may not be attractive company for Netanyahu, the
circumstances are vastly different. The perceived equation by the ICC
won't be looked at favorably on the world stage.
