**Content:** [TL;DR: yes.\
\
There is, to this day, a ban on importing haggis into the US because it
contains sheep lung, which is banned for import, as well as being banned
for use in any food product for human consumption. The US has been
considering reversing that ruling for several years, but it has yet to
do so.\
\
While you can\'t *import* traditional Scottish haggis into the US, it
can still be *produced* in the US (and this is the product sold in
restaurants and in Scottish butcher shops), and is nearly identical to
the authentic Scottish product, with two exceptions:\
]{.rendered_qtext}

1.  The USDA does not allow sheep lung to be used in any product for
    human consumption, so the haggis produced in the US does not have
    it.
2.  The haggis produced in the US is not encased in a stomach, but in an
    artificial casing.

Other than that, the haggis produced here is identical to the authentic
Scottish product.\

McKean\'s is a company that produces \"authentic\" Scottish haggis in
the US (following the two rules above). Their [[Frequently Asked
