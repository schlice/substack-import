First, let's talk about the gun itself.

You stated that guns are a tool that is only use is to kill, and this is
incorrect. There is a vast difference between what a tool was *designed*
to do, and what its primary or secondary uses are.

It might surprise you that knives were designed to kill. But they found
much more utility as tools than as killing implements. They are indeed
still used to kill, but they have found more use as cutting implements
than as killing implements.

Hammers were designed to apply directed force at nails. They are still
used for that purpose. But hammers can also kill, and they are used to
kill today.

Guns were designed to kill, just like knives were. But the utility of
the gun in killing is the fact that it can kill at *standoff distances*
(distances where the gun operator cannot be hurt by whatever they are
killing). But guns can do more than kill. Guns can stop crime, *in many
cases just by their mere presence.* Guns equalize the force disparity
between the strong and the weak, the few and the many, and the old and
the young.

\

Now, let's talk about your false equivalence.

You are attempting to say that "gun nuts" (whatever that means) value
their guns over the lives of innocent children in schools. So since this
"gun nut" is someone who values inanimate objects over human life, I
would say that this person is clearly mentally deficient. Whoever that
person is should get help.

You are next attempting to make the claim that *because* guns are
designed to kill, *therefore* we shouldn't have them because sometimes
innocent people are killed. Sure, sometimes innocent people are killed
by bad people with guns. But sometimes innocent people are killed by bad
people with cars, and sometimes innocent people are killed by bad people
with fire, and sometimes innocent people are killed by bad people with
hammers. Is the answer to ban all of those tools? Or is the answer to
find the common denominator and work on that? I see the common
denominator in all of those as **the bad person**. Focus on stopping the
bad person, don't think that the bad person will be *less bad* because
you have removed his tool. The bad person will still be bad; he'll just
use a different tool.

Plus, you've ignored the good that guns do. I pointed out the fact that
guns can stop crime. In fact, they do this *many, many more times* than
they facilitate crime. Millions of times a year, a gun stops a crime
from taking place, **often without a single shot being fired.**

Yes, school shootings are tragic. But we've had guns long before we've
had a massive increase in school shootings. Understanding why we have
had a massive increase in school shootings would go a long way to
stopping them.
