**Can Hannity, Carlson, Fox be prosecuted for Covid-19 lies? If Someone
can be prosecuted for yelling fire in a crowded theater, can Fox and
Company be prosecuted for minimizing, trivializing, calling the
coronavirus a hoax?**

Shouting fire in a crowded theater actually creates a danger where no
danger previously existed. This is illegal.

Minimizing coronavirus is an opinion. So is trivializing and calling the
virus a hoax (to the extent that this was actually done). These guys are
opinion hosts. Stating your opinion is not illegal. There may be
consequences, but none of them are legal consequences.
