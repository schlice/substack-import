Absolutely not. The American flag he has on his chest is backwards.

Since the link is wonky, let me post a link to the image and the image
itself:

It's kinda hard to see behind the scope, but the American flag patch he
has on his chest should have the field of stars on the left. You can see
the flag printed on his T-shirt on his right arm; that flag is in the
correct orientation.

Oh, you meant the whole "carrying a rifle" thing? Well, he does have the
dust cover on the ejection port open, but that just means he's going to
go home with a dirty bolt, but that's not my problem.

So no, I don't see anything wrong with what he's doing. He doesn't
appear to be threatening anyone. He doesn't appear to be doing anything
illegal.
