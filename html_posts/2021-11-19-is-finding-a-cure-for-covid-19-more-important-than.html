If you are the Left, then yes it is.

Because clearly, **your right to privacy** (which the Supreme Court
found in the Constitution --- see *Griswold v. Connecticut*) **can be
eliminated if the need is great enough.**

We can *force* you to get a vaccine against your will. I'm old enough to
remember "my body, my choice." Not any more, pumpkin. Your body, MY
CHOICE. You don't get to choose what you put in your body, the State
does.

And yes, it's "slippery slope thinking," but if it's *this easy* to
eliminate a Constitutional right, what other Constitutional rights are
easy to eliminate? You know, like that pesky right to free speech. We
need free and fair elections, we must have information distributed by
the State only to ensure that. And guns? Only the police should have
those. Well, and bad guys too, but that makes it easy to tell who is a
bad guy. If you have a gun and you're not a police officer, you're a bad
guy. See? If we just eliminate your rights, things get so simple!

And by the way, there is no "cure" for COVID-19. We will never get to
100% vaccination. The virus will become endemic, just like Influenza. It
becomes more virulent, but less dangerous. You'll get a fever, chills,
sniffles, body aches, etc., and that's about it. We'll get a combined
flu + COVID shot every year for perpetuity. And you can still not get
the shot, and still risk getting the flu or COVID. And life will go on.

Original question:

Is finding a cure for Covid-19 more important than the United States
Bill of Rights or even the U.S. Constitution?
