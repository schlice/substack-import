**In light of the Manafort verdict and Cohen\'s plea bargain, is
President Trump a criminal?**

Manafort was convicted on five counts of filing false tax returns, one
count of not filing a required IRS form, and two bank fraud counts.

Cohen pled guilty to violating campaign finance laws, as well as
multiple counts of tax evasion and fraud.

Only they were charged. Those charges were for violations of Federal law
that those individuals made, as individuals.

None of this has anything to do with Trump. **EVEN IF** he paid off
Stormy Daniels to keep her quiet, that's not illegal. **EVEN IF** he
lied about knowing about the payments, that too is not illegal. If he
was under oath and lied, that would be a different story, but he hasn't
broken any laws.

The best they have: Trump *may have* run afoul of campaign finance law
by making a politically motivated payment to influence the campaign.
However, if there is a non-political motive which the person can claim
(and in this case, there most certainly is), then the payment would not
be unlawful.

And that's the best they got.
