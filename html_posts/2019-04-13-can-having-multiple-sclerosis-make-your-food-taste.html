**Can having multiple sclerosis make your food tastes change?**

There are two separate questions here, and you could be asking either
one. My colleagues have been answering the first question: *does having
MS cause food to taste different?* There is a second question: *does
having MS cause your food "tastes" (i.e. preferences) to change?* I
think that the appropriate question for this cohort is the first one:
*does MS cause your food to taste different?*

One thing I will caution you about MS: Because MS affects everyone
differently, we can't really say whether or not any particular symptom
is or is not MS. There is a tendency, therefore, to assume *everything*
that is unknown is MS. We with MS tend to blame anything unusual or
unknown on MS. "My hip is constantly itchy. Think that's MS?" "My hair
has been so dry lately. Think that's the MS?" "My toenail is growing
crooked. It must be MS." In general, if it's highly unusual that a
symptom is found in the general population of people with MS, then it's
highly unlikely that your particular symptom is directly related to MS
disease activity, and you should probably rule out any other cause of
the symptom before assuming that it might be MS.

That said, it is at least *conceivable* that MS could cause your food to
taste different (i.e. could the nerve pathways be affected in such a way
that food now tastes different). However, it's highly unlikely. The area
of the brain which controls taste and the nerve pathways from the tongue
to the brain are not *usually* impacted by MS. However, there was at
least one rather fascinating study about taste and MS, and the
observation really nails why this might be important (**emphasis**
mine):

To summarize briefly, the study found that people with MS had a
significant difference in which categories of flavors (sweet, sour,
bitter, and salty) they were able to distinguish, with the largest
variances in the salty and sweet categories.

What the study *didn't* account for was MS medications. The medications
all work differently and have different methods of administration. It is
also at least conceivable that MS medications affect taste as much as MS
does.

Nevertheless, there is at least one clinical study which has shown that
some people with MS do indeed taste things differently, and while it's
not a tremendous number of people, it's at least statistically
significant. This is incredibly important for people with MS who also
have nutritional issues and who struggle with getting enough calories.
In other words, *part of the problem with their caloric intake may
simply be that food doesn't taste good anymore*.
