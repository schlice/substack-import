The Columbine High School shooting was a ***watershed moment*** in
United States history that changed many different facets of child
development and public school education in the blink of an eye on April
20, 1999.

The shooting changed the way schools think about bullying, and caused
bully prevention programs to be completely overhauled in schools. The
topic of school security became mainstream, and instead of "duck and
cover" drills, schools now do "active shooter" drills. Columbine changed
American primary schooling forever.

Columbine also marked a pivotal change in how law enforcement reacts to
these types of situations. It coined new terms, like **active shooter**,
and changed the entire paradigm of how law enforcement deals with those
situations.

Secondarily, Columbine sparked intense debate in the country over teen
use of antidepressants, and violence in video games. It brought the
"goth culture" into the fore, and made the "social outcast" into a
veritable pariah.

Columbine was a situation where the killers went in with their end goal
of *killing students*. They knew they were not coming out alive. They
wanted to go down in a blaze of glory, and take as many students with
them as possible. While this kind of thing happened occasionally, it
rarely happened at grade schools.

Before and during the Columbine shooting, law enforcement's role was to
**contain** the situation, and to attempt to use hostage negotiators to
**de-escalate** the situation. Previously, these situations would be
hostage negotiation situations, and the perpetrator generally *wanted
something* from law enforcement: a getaway vehicle, time on the local
news, an amount of money, someone released from prison, etc. Columbine
was different in that the school was not a *means to an end*, but was
*the end itself*. The students were innocent victims of the
perpetrators' delusions, and high school bullying became the impetus for
mass killings.

Law enforcement had to completely re-tool. They could no longer afford
to contain and de-escalate. They had to immediately go in and stop the
active shooter, knowing that the shooter's goal was to kill as many
innocent people as he could, and he likely planned on taking his own
life when law enforcement eventually made it in. The goal, therefore,
was to accelerate that end-game, so that the loss of innocent life was
as minimal as possible. The idea now is overwhelming force as quickly as
is humanly possible. The sooner armed response can get in and confront
the shooter, the better chance of saving lives. Police departments
around the country re-trained their officers, and now conduct regular
Active Shooter Training in schools.

Schools had to radically change the way they do business. Now, all
exterior doors to schools are locked from the outside, except for the
main entrance (which in some schools is also locked and you must be
physically buzzed in). Security cameras were added to most schools. All
people in the school now enter through a choke point, all people within
the school are accounted for, and school staff is accountable for the
roster of people within the school at all times. Armed school security
is now a thing, and most schools have some form of armed security at all
times. Many secondary schools have representatives from the local police
department permanently stationed there (known as School Resource
Officers, or SROs), who would ultimately coordinate emergency response
to active shooter situations.

Also, schools had to re-tool their bully prevention programs, to attempt
to stop the kind of bullying that drove Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris to
plan out and perform their killing spree. Bullying behavior is
relentlessly pursued and eliminated.

Many schools have adopted a "zero-tolerance policy" to any bullying or
gun-related behavior, which frankly goes too far in many cases. One such
example of extreme school policy:

Ultimately, Columbine marked several pivotal changes in public school
education in the United States, including how we think about bullying
behavior and social outcasts, how we think about defending the students
within a school, and how we think about stopping active shooters.
