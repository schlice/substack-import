**Is it legal for the speaker of the house not to send impeachment to
the Senate?**

The Constitution does not specify the time frame within which the
Articles of Impeachment must be sent to the Senate, so it's not
"technically" illegal.

However, the Senate has a Constitutional duty to hold a trial, and they
cannot commence with their Constitutional responsibilities until the
House sends the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate.

There is no Constitutionally-acceptable reason under which the Speaker
has the right to withhold the Articles from the Senate other than she
doesn't want to see justice done. Oh yes, she's made her excuses. The
Senate won't hold a fair trial! The Senators have publicly stated their
biases! On and on the excuses roll, and yet none of them are grounded in
any Constitutional authority.

The only authority the House is banking on: it's never been done before,
and there's no law or Constitutional provision specifically prohibiting
it, so it's not technically illegal. She can grandstand all she likes
until someone with authority (i.e. the court) says otherwise.
