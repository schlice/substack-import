The short answer is yes.

The longer answer is that the HOA must put a *lien* on the house for the
amount of the unpaid dues, fees, fines, or anything else the homeowner
owes. Once the lien is attached, the homeowner no longer deals with the
HOA, but with the HOA's attorney, and the attorney's fees also get added
to what the homeowner owes. The attorney *may* work out a payment plan
with the delinquent homeowner. Note that I said *may*, they are under no
obligation to do so.

Once the amount of the unpaid money reaches a specific level (varies by
state), the attorney (as proxy for the HOA) can foreclose on the lien,
sell the property and collect their unpaid money from the proceeds.

Original question:

Can a homeowner\'s association (HOA) foreclose on a property if the
owner has not paid HOA fees or fines, and the property is paid off?
