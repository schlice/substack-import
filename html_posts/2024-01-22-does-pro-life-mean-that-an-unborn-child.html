No. Pro-life means that **both** lives have equal value. Pro-life means,
at the very least, we do not *devalue* the life of the child.

This does not, however, impact our ability to save the mother's life. If
a choice must be made and only one life can be saved, we would still
choose to save the mother. However, this is a very rare circumstance,
and even in the best of conditions, it is not at all clear on what to do
in such a situation.

Despite the corner case, the exception does not drive the belief. We
still value both lives equally. In other words, the baby has as much
right to live as the mother.
