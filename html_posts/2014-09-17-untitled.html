**Content:** [And if you reduce the number of kitchen knives, kitchen
knife violence will decrease. That\'s a foregone conclusion. So if your
only goal is to reduce the number of people killed with guns, reducing
the number of guns will do that. But will that reduce crime? Will it
reduce violence? Nope, statistics show that there was no significant
reduction in overall crime when Australia\'s gun ban was enacted.
Suicides by self-inflicted gunshot wounds did decrease. But not much.
Where did these guns come from? I mean they banned them, didn\'t they?
Only the illegal guns remain now, and people are
defenseless.]{.rendered_qtext}
