<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [And if you reduce the number of kitchen knives, kitchen<br>knife violence will decrease. That\'s a foregone conclusion. So if your<br>only goal is to reduce the number of people killed with guns, reducing<br>the number of guns will do that. But will that reduce crime? Will it<br>reduce violence? Nope, statistics show that there was no significant<br>reduction in overall crime when Australia\'s gun ban was enacted.<br>Suicides by self-inflicted gunshot wounds did decrease. But not much.<br>Where did these guns come from? I mean they banned them, didn\'t they?<br>Only the illegal guns remain now, and people are<br>defenseless.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-are-common-logical-fallacies-in-gun-control-arguments/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
