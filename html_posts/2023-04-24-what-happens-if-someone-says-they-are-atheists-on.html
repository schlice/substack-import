The United States government cannot endorse any religion, because of the
First Amendment to the Constitution. Therefore, requiring a religion in
order to serve in the military would be unconstitutional. The religion
question really only pertains to last rites or military hospital stays.
Also these days, it pertains to when you expect to be able to have time
to worship.

Your religious preference gets stamped on your dog tags, so that they
know which chaplain to call if you're dying.

So if you are atheist, you can definitely have "ATHEIST" added to your
dog tags, and no chaplain will be called to administer you last rites if
you're dying. You also won't be expected to ask for time to worship
during Basic Training. You'll simply have an appropriately-sized period
of "unstructured time" to yourself.
