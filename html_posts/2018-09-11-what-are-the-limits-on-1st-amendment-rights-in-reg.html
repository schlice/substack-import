**What are the limits on 1st amendment rights in regards to employees of
the federal government?**

First, let's correct your terminology. What you call "First Amendment
Rights" are actually natural rights you have as a human being. The First
Amendment simply prevents the government from making any law infringing
on your natural right. However, that's the government restricting a
private citizen. Employers retain the right to fire you if they don't
like your protected speech.

But the situation gets much more complicated if the government is the
employer. The government certainly has a legitimate need to maintain an
appropriate workplace and control speech, but it wouldn't be right if a
government employee had fewer rights than a private employee, either.

Courts currently apply a three-prong test to determine if a government
employee's speech has First Amendment protection:

1.  **Government employees are only protected by the First Amendment
    when they are speaking as** ***private citizens*.\
    \**
    If their speech is part of their official job duties, then they can
    be fired or disciplined for it.
2.  **If a government employee was speaking as a private citizen, was
    their speech regarding a matter of public concern?**\
    \
    If they weren't speaking on a matter of public concern, the First
    Amendment will *not* protect their speech.
3.  **If a government employee was speaking as a private citizen on a
    matter of public concern, is the government's interest in
    efficiently fulfilling its public services greater than the
    employee's interest in speaking freely?\
    \**
    Courts analyze the government's interest in efficiently fulfilling
    its public services using the following criteria:
    1.  Whether the speech would interfere with the employee's
        responsibilities;
    2.  The nature of the working relationship between the speaker and
        those at whom the criticism was directed;
    3.  Whether the relationship between the speaker and the person
        criticized was sufficiently close that the speech would create
        disharmonious relations in the workplace;
    4.  Whether the speech would undermine an immediate superior's
        discipline over the employee; and
    5.  Whether the speech would compromise the loyalty and confidence
        required of close working employees.[\[1\]](#CuAnO){#cite-CuAnO
