**Why don\'t people acknowledge that the real constitutional crisis
happened when Loretta Lynch did not have Trump arrested for saying,
\"Russia if you\'re listening I hope you find the 30,000 emails\"? Why
hasn\'t he been arrested for that since?**

Not only do we have the 1st Amendment in the United States, but
"political speech" is especially well-protected.

Also, Trump wasn't the president at the time he said that. He was a
private citizen. It would be like me saying it at a rally. I'm just Joe
Nobody, which at the time he was as well. As people have been wont to
say lately, private citizens can't negotiate with foreign governments;
it's illegal. Plus, you have no power to effect any change.

Thankfully, such charges would be based on the "reasonable man" test.
Would a reasonable man consider Trump's statement as "negotiating with
foreign governments," "negotiating a treaty," or "a harmless joke?"
Thankfully, the **reasonable** man would look at the context and see
that Trump was simply trying to make a joke. At the time, the Democrats
were trying to point the finger at Russia regarding hacking, so Trump
was playing on that, basically saying that if Russia was so good at
hacking, maybe they could find Hillary's "missing" emails.
