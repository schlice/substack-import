**Content:** [While you might like to set some conditions that nations
must follow, nations are independent. They don\'t answer to any \"world
government\". You can certainly write a treatise in the United Nations
for member states to use as guidelines, but there is no one organization
that can direct nations\' laws.\
\
A nation can determine on its own whether or not it feels that
pre-emptive military action is appropriate. The rest of the nations in
the world can judge for themselves whether or not they think that this
action was justified and can make policies to deal with that nation
accordingly. So nations who act unilaterally and unprovoked not only
face the wrath of their own citizens, but the rest of the
world.]{.rendered_qtext}
