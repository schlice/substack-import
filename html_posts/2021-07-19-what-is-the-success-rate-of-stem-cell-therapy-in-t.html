It's difficult to say, because success is dictated by lots of factors,
and varies by the disease being treated. Additionally, adult stem cells
have been very successful, while embryonic stem cells have yet to find a
single success in treatment. Stem cell therapy is not an approved
therapy for every disease or condition, so there is no "overall success
rate" for stem cell therapy. However, in general, we can say that adult
stem cells induced into pluripotency have been treating diseases
effectively for many years now, treating dozens of diseases and
disorders.

Specifically in my case, stem cells have shown great promise in a
procedure called Hematopoietic Stem Cell Therapy (HSCT). You've probably
heard of it referred to as a "bone marrow transplant." Here's how it
works:

HSCT has shown some success in treating MS, but not 100% success. We are
finding that HSCT is very effective against certain forms of MS, and is
less effective against others.
