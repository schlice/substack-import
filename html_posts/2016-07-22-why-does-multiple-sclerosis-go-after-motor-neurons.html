To be clear, MS does not attack motor neurons. MS attacks the myelin
sheath which surrounds nerve fibers in the central nervous system in
your brain and your spinal cord. When the myelin is damaged, signals
which normally traverse these nerves are degraded. Think of it as the
insulation around an electrical wire. When the insulation is damaged,
signals do not flow down the wire nearly as efficiently as they used to.
Many different types of nerve cells are affected, including the ones
that help you see, and the ones that help you pee and poo, along with
the ones that help you walk and think.

You may be thinking of ALS, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. ALS, also
known as "Lou Gehrig's Disease," actually does attack motor neurons,
destroying the actual nerve fiber in your brain and spinal cord. These
are actual motor neurons that get destroyed, neurons that control
voluntary motion in your arms and legs. As the neurons are destroyed,
myelin sheaths harden.

Symptoms (at least initially) can be similar, but ALS progresses much
more quickly. On average, people with ALS live about five years after
their diagnosis, where MS is not fatal.
