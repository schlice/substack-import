Building on [[Tom
Martin](https://www.quora.com/profile/Tom-Martin-385)]{.qlink_container}\'s
answer, it really depends on what is important to you and your family.
If you are looking for the best schools, I will agree that [[Academy
District
20](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b892ff&url=http://www.asd20.org){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="asd20.org"}]{.qlink_container} is your best bet. This will
influence where you decide to live, although you can choice into the
district. It\'s just much easier to get your child enrolled in a D20
school if you actually live in D20.

D20 also encompass the North end of the city, which is much newer.
You\'ll be looking in the Briargate and Pine Creek neighborhoods, and
further north into Northgate and Gleneagle, and east to Cordera. You\'ll
find the newest neighborhoods there. But clearly, you\'ll pay more for
these houses, which are frequently 10 years old or newer.

If you\'re looking to save money on a house, you might look a little
further south towards Woodmen, or west towards Rockrimmon. Still in D20,
but older, more established neighborhoods.
