There is a lot of confusion among my esteemed colleagues as to whether
or not this is rape.

**The answer is** ***it depends*.**

The reason is because what you're referring to is what we call
"affirmative consent." You did **not** provide affirmative consent, but
you did **not** also reach the legal level under which the entire
country considers to be rape: as [[Matthew
Bates](https://www.quora.com/profile/Matthew-Bates-27)]{.qlink_container}
indicated: you are of legal age and sober, and you did not say "no" or
some form of "no," and you did not physically indicate no by pushing
away or kicking away.

Therefore, *you did not say no, but you also did not say yes.*

Whether or not a lack of affirmative consent constitutes rape will
[[depend on where you
are](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ba3431&url=http://affirmativeconsent.com/affirmative-consent-laws-state-by-state/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="affirmativeconsent.com"}]{.qlink_container}.

Currently, California has a college and high school affirmative consent
law signed. Louisiana, Indiana, and Virginia have college affirmative
consent laws, but not high school. Illinois, New York, and Connecticut
have general affirmative consent laws in place (i.e. not
school-related). All other states either have no affirmative consent, or
legislation pending.

So your actions, depending on whether or not your state requires
affirmative consent, and whether or not you are in school, ***may*** be
considered rape if you were in a state that has some form of affirmative
consent law in place and your situation meets those state requirements.
Otherwise, if you didn't say no or otherwise indicate no, it's not rape.

And also, there is no such thing as "consensual rape." It is, or it
isn't.
