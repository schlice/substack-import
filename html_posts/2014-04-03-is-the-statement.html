<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Absolutely true, and is the entire motivation behind the<br>[[Posse Comitatus Act of<br>1878](https://www.quora.com/topic/Posse-Comitatus-Act-of-1878)]{.qlink_container},<br>which was designed to limit the federal government\'s use of federal<br>military personnel to enforce state law. The Act was updated in 1981,<br>reaffirming and strengthening it.\<br>\<br>The Act is only applicable to the [[United States Armed<br>Forces](https://www.quora.com/topic/United-States-Armed-Forces)]{.qlink_container}.<br>It is not applicable to the [[U.S. National<br>Guard](https://www.quora.com/topic/U-S-National-Guard)]{.qlink_container}<br>which can enforce state law at the direction of the Governor, nor is it<br>applicable to the [[U.S. Coast<br>Guard](https://www.quora.com/topic/U-S-Coast-Guard)]{.qlink_container},<br>which works for [[U.S. Department of Homeland<br>Security](https://www.quora.com/topic/U-S-Department-of-Homeland-Security)]{.qlink_container}<br>(except when transferred to jurisdiction of the [[United States Navy<br>(USN)](https://www.quora.com/topic/United-States-Navy-USN)]{.qlink_container}<br>by the<br>[President(https://www.quora.com/topic/Presidents-of-the-United-States-of-America)]{.qlink_container}<br>or the [[U.S.<br>Congress](https://www.quora.com/topic/U-S-Congress-2)]{.qlink_container},<br>typically during times of war) and has a federal law enforcement role as<br>well as a federal regulatory agency role.\<br>\<br>There is one major exception to this rule, and it is codified in the<br>Insurrection Act of 1807 (as currently amended). The President can<br>employ US troops to enforce US law if conditions in the US become such<br>that states can no longer maintain order over lawlessness. The actual<br>text reads:\<br>\<br>]<br><br>> *(1) The President may employ the armed forces, including the National<br>> Guard in Federal service, to\--*\<br>> *(A) restore public order and enforce the laws of the United States<br>> when, as a result of a natural disaster, epidemic, or other serious<br>> public health emergency, terrorist attack or incident, or other<br>> condition in any State or possession of the United States, the<br>> President determines that\--*\<br>> *(i) domestic violence has occurred to such an extent that the<br>> constituted authorities of the State or possession are incapable of<br>> maintaining public order; and*\<br>> *(ii) such violence results in a condition described in paragraph (2);<br>> or*\<br>> *(B) suppress, in a State, any insurrection, domestic violence,<br>> unlawful combination, or conspiracy if such insurrection, violation,<br>> combination, or conspiracy results in a condition described in<br>> paragraph (2).*\<br>> \<br>> *(2) A condition described in this paragraph is a condition that\--*\<br>> *(A) so hinders the execution of the laws of a State or possession, as<br>> applicable, and of the United States within that State or possession,<br>> that any part or class of its people is deprived of a right,<br>> privilege, immunity, or protection named in the Constitution and<br>> secured by law, and the constituted authorities of that State or<br>> possession are unable, fail, or refuse to protect that right,<br>> privilege, or immunity, or to give that protection; or*\<br>> *(B) opposes or obstructs the execution of the laws of the United<br>> States or impedes the course of justice under those laws.*<br><br>\<br>The Act is very clear as to what conditions can constitute the use of<br>the military within the borders of the United States. I would also<br>venture to guess (being a former military officer myself) that you\'d<br>find quite a few more [[conscientious<br>objectors](https://www.quora.com/topic/Conscientious-Objection)]{.qlink_container}<br>should the military be ordered to fire against US citizens.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
