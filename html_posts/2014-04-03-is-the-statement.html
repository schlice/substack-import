**Content:** [Absolutely true, and is the entire motivation behind the
[[Posse Comitatus Act of
1878](https://www.quora.com/topic/Posse-Comitatus-Act-of-1878)]{.qlink_container},
which was designed to limit the federal government\'s use of federal
military personnel to enforce state law. The Act was updated in 1981,
reaffirming and strengthening it.\
\
The Act is only applicable to the [[United States Armed
Forces](https://www.quora.com/topic/United-States-Armed-Forces)]{.qlink_container}.
It is not applicable to the [[U.S. National
Guard](https://www.quora.com/topic/U-S-National-Guard)]{.qlink_container}
which can enforce state law at the direction of the Governor, nor is it
applicable to the [[U.S. Coast
Guard](https://www.quora.com/topic/U-S-Coast-Guard)]{.qlink_container},
which works for [[U.S. Department of Homeland
Security](https://www.quora.com/topic/U-S-Department-of-Homeland-Security)]{.qlink_container}
(except when transferred to jurisdiction of the [[United States Navy
(USN)](https://www.quora.com/topic/United-States-Navy-USN)]{.qlink_container}
by the
[[President](https://www.quora.com/topic/Presidents-of-the-United-States-of-America)]{.qlink_container}
or the [[U.S.
Congress](https://www.quora.com/topic/U-S-Congress-2)]{.qlink_container},
typically during times of war) and has a federal law enforcement role as
well as a federal regulatory agency role.\
\
There is one major exception to this rule, and it is codified in the
Insurrection Act of 1807 (as currently amended). The President can
employ US troops to enforce US law if conditions in the US become such
that states can no longer maintain order over lawlessness. The actual
text reads:\
\
]{.rendered_qtext}

> *(1) The President may employ the armed forces, including the National
> Guard in Federal service, to\--*\
> *(A) restore public order and enforce the laws of the United States
> when, as a result of a natural disaster, epidemic, or other serious
> public health emergency, terrorist attack or incident, or other
> condition in any State or possession of the United States, the

> *(i) domestic violence has occurred to such an extent that the

> *(ii) such violence results in a condition described in paragraph (2);
> or*\
> *(B) suppress, in a State, any insurrection, domestic violence,
> unlawful combination, or conspiracy if such insurrection, violation,

> \
> *(2) A condition described in this paragraph is a condition that\--*\
> *(A) so hinders the execution of the laws of a State or possession, as

> that any part or class of its people is deprived of a right,

\
The Act is very clear as to what conditions can constitute the use of
the military within the borders of the United States. I would also
venture to guess (being a former military officer myself) that you\'d
find quite a few more [[conscientious
objectors](https://www.quora.com/topic/Conscientious-Objection)]{.qlink_container}
should the military be ordered to fire against US citizens.
