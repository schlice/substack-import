**Who will help me overturn Terry v Ohio?**

Not many.

The Court found that \"a reasonably prudent man would have been
warranted in believing \[Terry\] was armed and thus presented a threat
to the officer\'s safety while he was investigating his suspicious
behavior.\" The search was limited in scope, to protect the officers'
safety incident to their investigation only.

There was only one dissent filed in the original *Terry* case. Justice
William O. Douglas believed that there was no circumstance that overrode
the 4th Amendment's prohibition on search without probable cause:

> it is a mystery how that \'search\' and that \'seizure\' can be

> \'probable cause\' to believe that (1) a crime had been committed or

Despite the dissent, the precedent stands. Officers can perform *Terry*
stops and frisk for weapons to ensure their safety.

So before you can overturn *Terry*, you need to have standing. You need
to be directly impacted by a *Terry* stop. You could also find someone
else who was directly impacted by a *Terry* stop who you believe had
their 4th Amendment rights violated, and you could ask to assist them in
a class action lawsuit.

Then, you need to find a compelling reason why the long-standing
precedent should be overturned. The case has shaped police behavior
throughout the US for decades, and it is unlikely to change any time
soon.

Maybe someone like the ACLU can help you. You should [[contact

case.
