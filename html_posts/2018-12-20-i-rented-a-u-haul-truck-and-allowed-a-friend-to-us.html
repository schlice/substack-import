**I wanted a U-Haul truck and allowed a friend to use it after I did.
She kept the truck for 7 days, can I sue her for the days she kept the
truck that needed to be paid for?**

In the United States, you can sue anyone for anything in small claims
court.

The question is whether or not you have a chance of recovering any of
your money. And that answer comes down to how you left it with her when
you let her use the truck.

- Did she know when the turn-in date was?
- Did she know she had to turn in the truck by that date?
- Did she know that you would continue to accrue charges for every day
  that she kept the truck?
- More importantly, did you make it clear to her that the truck was in
  fact due on that date and that you would be incurring continuous
  charges until it was turned in?

If you can prove that you made it clear to her that you would be
continuing to accrue charges for the entire time she had the truck, you
may be able to get her to reimburse you for the overage you paid during
her use of the truck.

If you can't prove it conclusively, you should at least be able to prove
that she *should have known* that a rental truck was, well, rented, and
that you were paying for it, and you should at least be able to get her
to pay *part* of the cost of the truck over those days.

So now, what does this all mean? I won't say that you'll be able to get
her to pay for 100% of the cost of the truck unless you had her sign an
agreement with you (which I'm certain you didn't do --- had I been in
that situation, I probably wouldn't have made her sign something
either). So you might be able to get part of the cost of the extra days
reimbursed, but I don't see you getting everything back.

Now, let's look at what this lawsuit will cost you: besides court costs,
you'll also lose a friend. You can't sue a friend and expect to stay
friends.

So: **is getting reimbursement for** ***part*** **of what those extra
days cost you worth losing a friend over?**

Maybe it's worth it to you, maybe it's not. That part is up to you. But
one thing is for certain: in my mind, it would have to be a lot of money
before I was willing to throw away a friendship over it.
