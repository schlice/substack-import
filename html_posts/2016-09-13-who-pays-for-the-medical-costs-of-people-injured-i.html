In the US, your medical plan will pay for your injuries.

Your insurance company will want to know how you became injured. They
may use that information to seek reimbursement for some of their costs.
For example, if you were injured in a car accident, your insurance
company may file lawsuit against the at-fault driver to recoup some of
your medical costs. Or they may seek reimbursement from the auto
insurance policy of the at-fault driver to cover your medical expenses.
Or they may just send you the bill and make you do all the work.

I admit, it may be difficult to recoup costs from terrorists.
