> What are genetically incorrect feelings?

I'm going to assume that a "genetically-incorrect feeling" is another
term for what we would call **gender dysphoria.**

Gender dysphoria is a term that describes a sense of unease that a
person may have because of a mismatch between their biological sex and
their gender identity. In other words, you may have been born a boy
(your biological sex) but you may "feel like" a girl, or "identify" as a
girl (your gender identity).

Clearly, this is a disorder in the brain. The debate today centers on
how to treat this disorder. There is a growing consensus of people who
believe that instead of treating it with medication, therapy and love,
we should cater to this disorder by having society accept your gender
identity rather than your biological sex. We should further your gender
identity by performing plastic surgery to remove your healthy,
functioning genitals so that your physical appearance more closely
matches your gender identity. However, know that no one can ever make a
boy into a girl. No surgery can ever change your gender, because your
gender exists all the way down to a cellular level. I think this may be
the origin of the term "genetically-incorrect feelings."

> Did God create them?

The short answer is no, but that's too simplistic for understanding.

Of course, God created everything, including us. But when He did, we
were created in perfect bodies which did not know sickness, pain, or
death. God also created us with *free will*, which is the ability to be
moral creatures and choose our own paths in life.

But at the time of our creation, humans chose *sin*, which is anything
that contradicts God's will for us. And when the first sin was committed
by disobeying God's commands, our bodies changed. When sin infected our
bodies, we now knew pain. We knew suffering. We knew disease, and we
knew death.

Mental issues are part of the disease which now infects our bodies,
because we live in a fallen world, in fallen bodies.

People are quick to reply, "Well God created everything, so He must have
created evil" or "God created us evil." God did create everything, but
*He did not need to create evil*. Evil is not a thing which can be
created. It is a state of being, it is an act in contravention to God's
will for us. Evil is a thing you do, not a thing you can touch. For
example, you can "make a hole" by digging in the dirt, but you can't
have a "hole" without the dirt around it. A hole is merely the absence
of dirt. In the same way, evil is not created, it is just the absence of
good. Our lives were created; evil is just a description of us choosing
to separate ourselves from God.
