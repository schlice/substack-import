**Does the Trump Organization charge the Secret Service employees of the
United States for rooms and service while they are protecting Donald
Trump when he golfs at his properties?**

No, Secret Service details are provided quarters at taxpayer expense
when they are on duty. The same was true for any president regardless of
where they were or what they were doing, including when they went on
vacation with their families.
