**Content:** [As you\'ve already heard, murder is a form of homicide.
Homicide means specifically \"the killing of a person.\" Murder (first
degree murder, to be precise) is a form of homicide which involves three
elements:\
]{.rendered_qtext}

- The unlawful taking of a life
- with forethought
- and malice.

Second-degree murder is the unlawful taking of a life with forethought.
Malice is not required. Third-degree murder (also called voluntary
manslaughter) only involves the unlawful taking of a life. \"Crimes of
passion\" are considered to be voluntary manslaughter. So if you kill
someone in a bar fight, it\'s second-degree murder. If you killed that
person because you just found out he slept with your wife, the charge
may be reduced to voluntary manslaughter.\
\
Involuntary manslaughter involves some criminally negligent action (or
failure to act when required to do so) which leads to the death of a
person.\
\
The taking of a life by a soldier in wartime is covered by the Law of
Armed Conflict. The Law of Armed Conflict is part of the Geneva
Convention which covers the conduct of countries at war. Violations of
the Law of Armed Conflict are punishable under the Uniform Code of
Military Justice (UCMJ). There are rules regarding when and where you
can fire on the enemy (collectively called \"Rules of Engagement\"), and
when you cannot. For example, you generally cannot fire on a hospital or
a church. But if the enemy has set up anti-aircraft missiles in that
building, they have now made that building a legal target through their
own actions. If the enemy has taken civilians and placed them inside
sensitive military buildings to act as \"human shields,\" they have
actually turned those civilians into enemy combatants under the Law of
Armed Conflict, and they are now valid targets. Although in that case,
we\'d try to avoid that building if at all possible. If it\'s not
possible, those civilians become, unfortunately, casualties of war.
\"Collateral damage\" occurs when non-targets are accidentally killed
due to uncontrollable circumstances (i.e. impact of a bomb
weakening/collapsing a neighboring building). As long as our soldiers
were not targeting those non-combatants, collateral damage is another
unfortunate side-effect of armed conflict.\
\
Soldiers who operate appropriately under the Law of Armed Conflict are
most generally immune from legal action charging them as criminals.
