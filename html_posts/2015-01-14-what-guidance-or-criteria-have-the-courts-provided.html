**Content:** [First, the \"exigent circumstances\" exception is not used
to \"violate\" civil liberties or to \"violate\" due process. They are
used during emergency situations to safeguard life and property.\
\
Exigent circumstances means that there exists an emergency situation
that requires \"swift action\" to prevent \"imminent danger to life\" or
\"serious damage to property.\" There is no \"litmus test\" to determine
if such circumstances exist; it is up to the responding official to use
the relevant facts at his immediate disposal to determine if exigent
circumstances exist. This was upheld by *People v Ramey (People v.
Ramey*, 545 P.2d 1333,1341 (Cal. 1976)).\
\
The court in *US v McConney*, which was ruling on a police entry into a
home, held that exigent circumstances are \"those circumstances that
would cause a reasonable person to believe that entry (or other relevant
prompt action) was necessary to prevent physical harm to the officers or
other persons, the destruction of relevant evidence, the escape of a
suspect, or some other consequence improperly frustrating legitimate law
enforcement efforts.\" (*United States v. McConney*, 728 F. 2d 1195,
1199 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 824 (1984))\
\
The court in *US v Reed,* which was ruling on an imminent destruction of
evidence exception, held that exigency may be determined by:\

- degree of urgency involved
- amount of time needed to get a search warrant (telephonic warrants
  must also be considered in determining amount of time to get a
  warrant)\
- whether evidence is about to be removed or destroyed, as well as ready
  destructibility of the evidence\
- danger at the site
- knowledge by the suspect that police are on the trail (*United
  States v. Reed*, 935 F. 2d 641 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 960
  (1991))

Since electronic data can be destroyed in seconds, warrantless seizures
using exigency criteria will be considered more frequently.
