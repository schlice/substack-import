**As an American man , how would you feel if you saw your wife having
sex with any other man?**

I also don't understand what the nationality has to do with the
question. While the percentage is smaller, there are married men in
America who participate in non-traditional marital arrangements. Some
married couples practice what they call "open relationships" in which
sex with multiple partners is permitted, sometimes even encouraged. Some
married couples engage in group sex with multiple partners. In that
case, those particular married men may be *excited* or *aroused*
watching their spouse have sex with other men. But that's outside of my
area of expertise. Perhaps [[Franklin

can add some color there.

For those who are in a monogamous marriage (one in which sex outside of
the marriage is not permitted), there would be some very negative
emotions which would follow seeing the events you described. Some of
those emotions would be *rage, betrayal,* and *sadness*, and may even be
described as a *broken heart.* For people who have monogamous
relationships, one of the partners violating that trust leads to some
very hurt feelings, and a difficult road to repair that relationship.
