**Under Castle Rock v. Gonzalez, the Supreme Court of the United States
ruled police have no duty to enforce. Does that mean that police owe
citizens no duty to protect and serve?**

That's almost exactly correct. The ruling extends other rulings
beginning with the watershed case *Warren v. District of Columbia*,
where it was shown that the police do not have a duty to protect any one
individual, but instead have a *general duty* to protect the population
*at large.*

"To Protect And Serve" is a *motto*, not a law or an oath.

The precedent in *Warren*, and extended in *Castle Rock*, states that
officers do not have an individual responsibility to protect any one
person unless a special relationship exists (i.e. a person is in custody
or specifically under police protection). The complainant in *Castle
Rock* argued that her restraining order created a special relationship
and that the police were required to protect her. SCOTUS ruled that
there was no legal requirement under Colorado law to enforce a
restraining order, and even if there was, it wouldn't create an
individual right to enforcement that could be considered a protected
entitlement, AND EVEN IF THERE WAS, such an entitlement would have no
monetary value, and would thus not be counted as eligible property for
due process purposes.

You are partially correct when you say that *Castle Rock v. Gonzalez*
states that the police have "no duty to enforce." Colorado has no law
which places the burden on law enforcement to enforce restraining
orders. There is nothing in state law which *requires* police to enforce
them, or subjecting the department to penalties if they fail to do so.
Therefore, the previous precedent is continued.

The precedent flows from the Due Process clause itself, and basically
says that while the *government* may not deprive an individual of life
without due process, this does not place a burden on the government to
protect your life against *someone else* taking it. In 1989, SCOTUS
stated, \"Nothing in the language of the Due Process Clause itself
requires the State to protect the life, liberty, and property of its
citizens against invasion by private actors.\" Generally, the Due
Process Clause does not provide an affirmative right to government aid,
\"even where such aid may be necessary to secure life, liberty, or
property interests of which the government itself may not deprive the
individual.\"
