**Are the police in America required to respond to all calls? Like if it
is a noise complaint for people being loud on the street.**

Short answer is no. There is no legal requirement that police respond to
all calls for service.

That said, they do try to respond to every one, but the response is
based on priority. If there is a call for a noise complaint and a call
for an armed robbery in progress, which call would you expect the police
to attend to first?

Therefore, they will probably get to it eventually, but maybe not right
away.
