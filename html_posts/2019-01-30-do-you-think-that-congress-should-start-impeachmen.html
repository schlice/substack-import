**Do you think that Congress should start impeachment proceedings for
Trump\'s actions and non actions concerning our national security?**

Once Mueller publishes his report, then impeach him.

I fully expect that a Democrat House ***will*** impeach the President
once the Mueller report is released.

And I also fully expect that a Republican Senate ***will not*** find
that he should be removed from office because of that impeachment.

And we can finally put this particular baby to bed.
