The short answer, for all legal questions, is "it depends." And in this
case, it depends on your Governing Documents.

It's different for every Association. In some cases, some Associations
may allow their Board members to enter on to your property to address
emergency situations while the homeowner is not home. In my last
association in Florida, Board members could access a homeowner's
property to address emergency situations which threatened nearby homes.
We had an incident at one house (where the owner was not home) where a
sprinkler head had broken and was spouting water on to the neighbor's
property (and their house). We entered the property and turned off the
reclaimed water at the meter, and then left messages for the homeowner
explaining what we did.

The true answer is to check your HOA's Governing Documents to find the
answer for your HOA.
