**Since a red light was mostly responsible for killing those six people
under that Miami bridge, do you think we should now outlaw red lights?**

No.

The only object which operated outside of its normal operating
parameters was the bridge, so the proximate cause of the deaths was the
bridge. It was the bridge that crushed the cars, not the red light.

The cars may still have been crushed even if the light was green and
they just happened to be under the bridge at that time. And if the cars
had failed to follow the law and failed to stop for the red light, they
might not have been crushed, or might still have been crushed depending
on when they decided to run the light. So the light itself was not the
proximate cause of the death, as adherence to the light, or even a
different color of light, could have still seen people die.

Following your logic, the people were in cars at the time they were
crushed, so we should now outlaw cars because you can get crushed inside
of them.

Additionally, those people in those cars were outside of their homes at
the time they were crushed. Therefore, people should not be allowed to
leave their homes any longer, because they could get crushed by bridges.

The insanity can continue, but really, the only cause that is proximate
to the death was the failing bridge. Don't try to put the blame anywhere
else.
