has all of the reasons a warrant can be issued.

Note that in all three cases (as in all cases when a warrant is issued),
warrants are issued by a judge. So regardless of how the warrant gets
brought before the court (the DA files charges, the police swear out an
affidavit, or the judge simply issues a bench warrant), it is always a
judge reviewing the case and issuing a warrant.
