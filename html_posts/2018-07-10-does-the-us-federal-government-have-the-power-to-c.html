**Does the U.S. federal government have the power to create
plebiscites?**

Can the government create a plebiscite? Yes they can.

Can they create a plebiscite for anything they like? **No**.

For example, can the federal government create a plebiscite to elect the
next President? **No.** Presidential elections are governed by the
Constitution. Can they *use* a plebiscite to determine national opinion?
Sure, but they still are required to follow the Constitutional process
to elect the President. The plebiscite cannot elect the President.

In short, in any case where a voting method is **prescribed** by the
Constitution, the Federal government cannot overrule that prescribed
method with a plebiscite.
