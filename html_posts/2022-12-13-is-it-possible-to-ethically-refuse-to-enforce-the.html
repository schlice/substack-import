*(US Answer Only)*

Yes! As a police officer, you can absolutely refuse to enforce the law
because of ethical reasons.

Just don't expect to keep your badge for much longer once you do.

Police officers are charged with enforcing the law, even the laws with
which they personally disagree. If they have ethical convictions which
prevent them from doing so, they can really no longer be effective
police officers, and will likely be asked to turn in their equipment
before they are escorted out of the building.
