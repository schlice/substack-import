Religion doesn't make you good. Religion makes you *saved*.

How "good" or "bad" you are is all part of your nature. Ultimately,
we're all bad people. We're all sinful people, living in broken, sinful
bodies, in a fallen, sinful world. Every last one of us is "bad,"
because we're sinners. God has every right to wipe us all out of
existence, and He'd be perfectly justified in doing so.

But He didn't.

Instead, He gave us a gift. He gave us *a way out* of this sinful life
and an ultimate destination of hell. He took the punishment for our sin
upon Himself, so that we could be *justified*. Christ's sacrifice on the
cross paid the debt for our sin. By accepting Christ, our sin debt is
paid, and we can enter the kingdom of Heaven.

But it means turning away from our sin nature. It means turning away
from the "bad" that we constantly do, and desiring to be better.

In other words, living for God means that I know I'm bad, and I choose
to be better. It doesn't make me good. I choose good, and God rewards me
for my repentance.
