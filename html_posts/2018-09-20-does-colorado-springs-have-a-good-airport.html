**Does Colorado Springs have a good airport?**

It depends on your definition of "good."

If "good" means to you that they have lots of flights to large
international hubs and a good assortment of direct flights to popular
destinations, then yes, the Colorado Springs Airport is "good." They
also have really good food, and easy access to the rest of the city.

If "good" to you means all direct flights to all of your favorite
destinations, you might be slightly disappointed.
