In some states, you have a "statutory right of redemption" which you can
exercise by paying the full foreclosure sale price (plus interest and
fees) within a set period of time after the foreclosure to the
foreclosure buyer. Not all states have a statutory right of redemption;
if you are interested in pursuing this right of redemption, check with a
real estate attorney in your area to see if you can do this. Homeowners
who live in states that have statutory redemption statutes must be able
to pay the exact amount of what the property was sold for at the final
foreclosure sale within the time period specified in your state
(anywhere between thirty days and one year), or else the lender can
re-seize it and sell it to another party.

Beyond statutory redemption, the only other method of avoiding
foreclosure is to pay off the amount you owe on any outstanding liens
against your home (especially the one foreclosing on its lien), or the
mortgage itself (if you stopped paying that).
