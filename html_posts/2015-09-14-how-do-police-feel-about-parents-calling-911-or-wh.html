**Content:** [The 911 system is reserved for true emergencies. This is
why 911 operators answer the phone with \"911, do you have an emergency
to report?\" Calling 911 when you do not have an emergency to report is
not only illegal, but keeps a 911 operator from answering the call for a
true emergency, potentially delaying emergency response for a true
emergency.\
\
Parents should also not use the police as their parental crutch. They
should learn to be better parents, not teach their kids to be afraid of
the police.]{.rendered_qtext}
