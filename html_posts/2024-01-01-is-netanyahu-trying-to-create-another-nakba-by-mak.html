Nope.

Netanyahu has three very simple, very clear goals which must be met
before the war will end:

- Hamas destroyed
- Gaza demilitarized
- Palestinians deradicalized

Once these are done, Israel will no longer be at war. If Gaza is
unlivable during this time, so be it. Until those three goals are
achieved, Gaza may remain unlivable.
