If you are on a **domestic** flight, you will not be arrested. TSA
checkpoints at domestic checkpoints are not tied in to NICS or any other
identification system at all. TSA makes sure your identification matches
your ticket. That\'s about the level of detailed checking they perform.

If you are on an ***international*** flight, you might be arrested. If
you are a suspect who might be thought to flee the country, and your
passport is \"flagged,\" you can be arrested at the checkpoint, but note
that this checkpoint is not administered by the TSA, but by US Customs
and Border Patrol (CBP).

So strictly speaking, TSA will not arrest you.
