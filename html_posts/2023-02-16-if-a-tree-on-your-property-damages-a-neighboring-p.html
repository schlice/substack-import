In most states, the condition of the tree before it fell and whether or
not you knew that it was in that condition will determine liability.

In short, if the tree was alive and healthy, you are not responsible if
it falls (i.e. during a hurricane) and damages your neighbor's property.

But if the tree was dead, you'd be liable for any damages it caused by
falling over onto your neighbor's property.

Additionally, if your tree was a hazard because it was dead or dying or
its limbs were broken *and you were notified about the issue* ***and you
did nothing***, not only are you liable, but your homeowner's insurance
won't even cover you because you were aware of the hazard and did not
address it.
