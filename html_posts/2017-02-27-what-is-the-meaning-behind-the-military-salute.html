Although we don't know the exact origin of the salute, it is generally
accepted that it originated in medieval times, when people who
approached a knight would raise their empty weapon hand to show they
were unarmed. Knights would use their sword hand to lift their visors on
their helmet armor to show another knight that they were friendly.

This evolved into a military courtesy, again generally accepted as seen
first in the British army, where the person rendering the salute uses an
upturned palm, as if lifting a visor. Originally, the custom stemmed
from grabbing the brim of the hat and tipping it off of the head as a
sign of respect, but the British Army was concerned about the wear and
tear this caused to the headgear, so the salute simply became applying
the hand to the tip of the brim, with the palm facing out as if lifting
a visor.

This image of the British Royal Armed Forces is significant, because the
American salute stemmed from the British Royal Navy salute. Notice the
difference here; this difference originally stemmed from the fact that
naval ships were sealed with tar and pitch; it was considered
exceptionally bad form to show a dirty palm to someone if rendering a
sign of respect, so the salute was turned to the palm-down orientation
to conceal any blackened palms.

It is generally accepted that the American salute has its origins in the
British Royal Navy salute.
