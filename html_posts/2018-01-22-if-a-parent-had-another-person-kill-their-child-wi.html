**If a parent had another person kill their child without them realising
what would be the legal implications for each person involved? E.g asked
them to administer medicine that was actually poison**

In the United States, the parent would be charged with [[**proxy
murder**](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c69ef6&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_murder){.external_link

qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} or simply murder,
depending on the jurisdiction. But the extent of the charges against the
parent would depend on how much the person administering the medicine
knew.

If the person administering the medicine was truly unaware that it was
poison and not medicine, that person would be charged with a
non-criminal homicide charge like accidental overdose, and would have a
very solid defense against that charge. Even if convicted, that person
wouldn't likely serve much time at all.

If the person administering the medicine had an inkling that something
might be wrong but did nothing about it (such that their actions in
administering the medicine despite their concerns were negligent), that
person would be charged with criminally negligent homicide; in other
words, a criminally negligent act which led to the death of a person.

If the person administering the medicine knew that it was poison, then
both actors would be charged with murder and conspiracy to commit
murder.
