<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [In all honesty, you shouldn\'t have to.\<br>\<br>If you are trying to be a good witness, all you have to do is describe<br>everything you see, to the best of your ability. Remember that while<br>being a good witness, you need to remember as much detail as you<br>possibly can (who/what/when/where/why/how). Don\'t forget to look at<br>your watch, too.\<br>\<br>You can say \"I saw what appeared to be a semi-automatic handgun based<br>on its size, shape, and color. I did not see a bright orange component<br>at the front, which would indicate that it was fake, and I did get a<br>good look at the muzzle end of the handgun, which appeared to be silver<br>metallic and not bright orange. The suspect did not fire the handgun, so<br>I could not tell if the ammunition was a bullet or a BB, or if the<br>handgun was loaded in any way.\" If it turns out to be a BB gun anyway,<br>that could be a fatal mistake for a burglar, but that doesn\'t change<br>what you saw as a witness.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
