**Content:** [In all honesty, you shouldn\'t have to.\
\
If you are trying to be a good witness, all you have to do is describe
everything you see, to the best of your ability. Remember that while
being a good witness, you need to remember as much detail as you
possibly can (who/what/when/where/why/how). Don\'t forget to look at
your watch, too.\
\
You can say \"I saw what appeared to be a semi-automatic handgun based
on its size, shape, and color. I did not see a bright orange component
at the front, which would indicate that it was fake, and I did get a
good look at the muzzle end of the handgun, which appeared to be silver
metallic and not bright orange. The suspect did not fire the handgun, so
I could not tell if the ammunition was a bullet or a BB, or if the
handgun was loaded in any way.\" If it turns out to be a BB gun anyway,
that could be a fatal mistake for a burglar, but that doesn\'t change
what you saw as a witness.]{.rendered_qtext}
