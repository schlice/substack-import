Interesting you should mention that. Since 2015 was the last complete
year, let's examine those numbers, shall we?

As you can see, whites were shot twice as often in 2015 as blacks. I
assume those are not the numbers you think should be reversed. I assume
it's the percentage when you include percentage of the population,
right?

For ease of calculation, let's assume the US population is 300 million,
and blacks make up 13% of the population, which would be 39 million.
Whites make up 63% of the population, which would be 189 million. Using
those numbers and plugging in the numbers shot by police, blacks are
killed at roughly twice the rate of whites.

As you postulated, shouldn't those be reversed? Why is it that blacks
are killed nearly twice as often by police as whites?

In order to answer that question, we need to answer this question: With
only 13% of the population, why do blacks commit over half of all of the
violent crimes in this country?

It appears to me, then, that **blacks are shot more frequently because
they are more frequently involved in criminal activity.**
