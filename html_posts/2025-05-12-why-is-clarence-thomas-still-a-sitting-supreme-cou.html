He is still a sitting Supreme Court Justice because he has not been
impeached.

The Constitution is abundantly clear on this point. Supreme Court
Justices are subject to impeachment. If there was proof, as you claim,
that he "sold his vote for gifts," then that evidence should be
presented to Congress so that they can begin Articles of Impeachment
against him.

To date, no such evidence has been presented to Congress, and Congress
has not begun impeachment procedures against him.

If you are aware of such evidence, you need to get it to your
Congressional Representative so that they can begin impeachment
proceedings.
