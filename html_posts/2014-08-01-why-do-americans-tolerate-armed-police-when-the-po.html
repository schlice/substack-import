**Content:** [The police are not \"instruments of the state\" insomuch
as they would follow the orders of the Governor outside of the law. The
police enforce the law, and in that capacity, they are doing the job
that **the people** appointed them to do. They wear a \"badge\" which is
a short name for \"badge of office.\" This indicates that they have been
properly trained and duly sworn to uphold the law. Yes it\'s true that
the state writes the laws, but in the United States, the power to govern
is derived from the people.\
\
Lately, it does seem that the state operates outside the will of the
people, but the people need to use their power to change that. If you
find the government is not acting in the best interest of the people,
you change the government. Vote them out of office.\
\
As for using your firearms against the police, if the police were
operating outside of the law (as a whole, not as an individual), you
would be within your Constitutional rights to protect yourself from such
unlawful action. Now, would you win in a firefight with the police?
Probably not. But the unlawfully-acting police would think twice before
trying to impose their will on you, wouldn\'t they?\
\
The final arbiter of who is right (you or the police) is the
law.]{.rendered_qtext}
