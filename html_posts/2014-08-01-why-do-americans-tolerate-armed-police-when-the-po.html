<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The police are not \"instruments of the state\" insomuch<br>as they would follow the orders of the Governor outside of the law. The<br>police enforce the law, and in that capacity, they are doing the job<br>that the people appointed them to do. They wear a \"badge\" which is<br>a short name for \"badge of office.\" This indicates that they have been<br>properly trained and duly sworn to uphold the law. Yes it\'s true that<br>the state writes the laws, but in the United States, the power to govern<br>is derived from the people.\<br>\<br>Lately, it does seem that the state operates outside the will of the<br>people, but the people need to use their power to change that. If you<br>find the government is not acting in the best interest of the people,<br>you change the government. Vote them out of office.\<br>\<br>As for using your firearms against the police, if the police were<br>operating outside of the law (as a whole, not as an individual), you<br>would be within your Constitutional rights to protect yourself from such<br>unlawful action. Now, would you win in a firefight with the police?<br>Probably not. But the unlawfully-acting police would think twice before<br>trying to impose their will on you, wouldn\'t they?\<br>\<br>The final arbiter of who is right (you or the police) is the<br>law.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
