We will see illegal abortions increase. But how *unsafe* exactly they
are is definitely in question.

The short answer: *abortion has become safer over the last 60 years, and
it's not because it was legalized.* Abortion has become safer due to
advances in antibiotics and medical practices.

The *myth* of "back-alley, coat-hanger abortions" was exactly that, a
myth, promulgated by the people trying the hardest to demonize illegal
abortions. Stanley Henshaw, who from 1979 to 2013 researched abortion
statistics at the Guttmacher Institute, said the following:

The safety of abortions is because of advances in medicine, not because
of legalization. We will still see illegal abortions happen, but they
will likely be by pill, not by coat-hanger. We will still see some
deaths, but not even near 300 per year. It will likely be much fewer
than even that.

Original question:

With the changes in laws about abortions in some of the states in the
USA, will this see the rise in unsafe illegal abortions?
