**How is it that Donald Trump can use the word \"bullshit\" to a crowd
in Bible Belt Louisiana and be greeted with cheers? How is this
acceptable in an American President?**

It seems you have a pretty high expectation of the person who holds the
office of the President. It seems you expect him (or her) to not only be
in charge of the Executive Branch, but somehow also be the moral and
spiritual leader of the free world.

News flash: **he's not**. The office of the President is an important
job, to be sure. But is he the moral leader of the country?

No, and he shouldn't be.

If you haven't noticed, Trump plays to his crowd. And if his crowd finds
that sort of tough talk acceptable, he'll use it. You should also know
that Trump knows his audience very well. He knows what his audience
would find acceptable, and he uses that.

And as we've said ever since 2015, Trump is a businessman, not a career
politician. He doesn't speak in the way you would expect a politician to
speak. He doesn't temper his words. He doesn't hold back either. He's a
brash, sometimes boorish New Yorker (I can say that as I am a former
brash, boorish New Yorker as well).

But you can't argue with results. And Trump delivers results.
