So let's assume a few things:

1.  You have a valid marriage license, fully executed, issued by your
    state.
2.  Your wife became pregnant through consensual sexual intercourse
    before you were married.

Your rights are no different than the hetero couples where this happens.

There are a few natural problems with this scenario. In a hetero
marriage, when a baby is born "into the marriage," it is assumed that
the man is the father until that assumption is challenged. However, in
your specific case, you are clearly not presumed to be the father.
Nevertheless, the father still has to come forward and file a petition
to establish a Parent Child relationship before any of his rights will
be recognized, and his responsibilities kick in.

As responsibilities go, he will have to pay child support and provide
health insurance or reimburse you for it. He would also be on the hook
for college expenses, as well as the child having a claim on his estate.

As far as rights are concerned, depending on how long it takes for the
father to step forward, he may not be granted visitation, and
considering that the child was born into your marriage, the court will
look askance at disrupting that relationship.

If the father files a petition to establish a parent child relationship,
you should immediately engage the services of a qualified attorney in
your area, especially one who specializes in family law.
