**Could communities that self-police work? It sounds like a good idea in
concept, but it\'s not hard to imagine jurisdiction conflicts and
discrimination if outsiders can freely travel into that district.**

I take it you've never been to the East Coast of the US then, have you.
Specifically the Northeast, where "incorporated townships" are quite
common. In fact, in all six New England states, the incorporated
township is the main form of local government. [[New
York](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d01958&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_divisions_of_New_York_(state)){.external_link

62 counties, which are subdivided into 932 towns and 62 cities, which
are all authorized by the state Constitution to provide all municipal
services to their residents, and while most provide little more than
water and electricity services, some go as far as to provide

When a town "incorporates," it receives a charter from the state and
becomes a municipality, similar to a city. It can provide all services
to its residence, including police services.

I wonder if you're not thinking of incorporated townships or
municipalities when you refer to "community self-policing," but rather
more along the lines of unorganized, community-watch type policing. I
think that there would be many problems with such a setup, most notably
legal issues, as these people who participate are not authorized by any
government to carry out the law enforcement function. Therefore, any
"arrests" they make can be instantly challenged in court as the person
has no authority in law under which they can enforce the laws of the
state. There must be someone who is authorized to act "under color of
law" to enforce those laws, and only a duly appointed law enforcement
agency, authorized by the state, can do that.

State agencies are authorized when they train their officers to meet
state standards. A Peace Officer Standardization Training (POST) Board
at the state level authorizes local police departments to train and
certify that officers meet those standards. It is only then that those
officers are authorized to be sworn into office and assume the authority
to enforce the law. Communities which self-police would not have such
authorization, and therefore may operate outside of state-sanctioned
authority. It's really a recipe for disaster.

Communities work best when they work ***with*** local law enforcement.
Communities can organize "neighborhood watch" groups under the direction
of local police. A properly organized neighborhood watch is aware of
crime rates and current crime trends in their area, and advises their
residents on strategies to stay free of crime (i.e. leaving porch lights
on overnight, removing valuables from vehicles parked in driveways,
etc), and also remains aware of activities going on within their
communities. Who better to know what vehicles belong and don't belong in
your neighborhood than the actual people who live there? Who better to
know what exactly is a problem and what is not than the residents?

A well-functioning neighborhood watch is also known within the local
department, and calls for service from such a community can be given
higher priority.
