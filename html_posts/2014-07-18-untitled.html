**Content:** [It\'s a pity that you don\'t consider my right to protect
my family a reasonable use of a firearm despite your knowledge of
firearms.\
\
Here\'s some numbers for you to chew on.\
\
From FBI crime statistics:\
\
Total burglaries in 2012: 2,103,787.\
\
But a burglary happens with no one home.\
\
Total robberies in 2012: 354,520\
\
That\'s one robbery every 1.5 minutes. But robberies can occur
anywhere.\
\
Total robberies within the home: 59,889.\
\
Those are robberies that take place when someone is home. That works out
to one home invasion every 9 minutes.]{.rendered_qtext}
