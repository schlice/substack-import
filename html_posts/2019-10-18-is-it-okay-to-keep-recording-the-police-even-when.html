*(US Answer)*

**Is it legal to video record a police officer who is performing his
official duties even if he tells you to stop?**

If you have been ordered by a police officer to stop recording and you
fail to do so, you are violating the lawful order of a peace officer,
which is illegal.

Whether or not that order ***is actually lawful*** is a matter of law
which can only be settled by a judge in a courtroom, not on scene
between you and the officer.

So an officer can tell you to stop recording, you can refuse claiming
you have a right, and he can arrest you and seize your recording device.
But again, whether or not that arrest will hold up in court is a matter
for a judge to decide.

There are two competing interests: the police may have a valid reason to
disallow recording, and you have a First Amendment right to record
anyone in a public place. Only a judge can sort out whose interests take
precedence in any particular case.

**TL;DR: If you have been ordered to stop recording, it is illegal to
continue recording.**
