**Content:** [For people with Relapsing/Remitting MS (RRMS), every day
brings a new wonder when you open your eyes. \"Will my eyes work this
morning?\" \"Will my legs support me when I step onto the floor?\"
\"Will I have trouble with my morning constitutional?\" \"Will I have
trouble swallowing my breakfast this morning?\" \"Am I going to be too
tired to go out with the family tonight?\" \"Am I going to lose focus at
my job today?\" Or, more worryingly, \"Are any of my previous symptoms
going to come back today?\" MS brings a range of \"unknowns\" to your
day, each and every day.\
\
The trick to living well with MS is knowing how to quiet your demons and
live for the day you have rather than worrying about the days you may
not have.\
\
I can tell you that I haven\'t quite mastered living well with MS. It\'s
a process. I\'ve gotten much, much better at it, but I know I\'m not
\"there\" yet.]{.rendered_qtext}
