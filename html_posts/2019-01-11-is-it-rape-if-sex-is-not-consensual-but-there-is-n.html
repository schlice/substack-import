**Is it rape if sex is not consensual, but there is no refusal
signaled?**

Depends on where you are. The definition of consent varies.

In the United States, it depends on the state. There are roughly five
states in the US where you must get affirmative consent. California
requires affirmative consent not just for adults, but for anyone of any
age (personally, I find it problematic to have a high school affirmative
consent law when non-adults cannot legally consent to sex anyway, but we
are talking about California here). In these states, you can only have
consensual sex when both parties actively agree. We call these "yes
means yes" states.

[[Affirmative Consent Laws (Yes Means Yes) State by
State](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ba3431&url=http://affirmativeconsent.com/affirmative-consent-laws-state-by-state/){.external_link

For every other state in the country, it's not "yes means yes," it's "no
means no." In order to be sexual assault, someone must say no. In those
states, you only have "non-consensual" sex when someone says no. When
one party says no, both parties must disengage immediately.

Additionally, both parties must be able to say yes or no in order to
actually consent in any state. So if someone is drunk, they can't
actually say yes or no with a clear mind, so that *implies* no.
