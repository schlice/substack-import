**Gun control proponents often talk about compromise. What proposals
have been made to give in exchange for what they would like to take?**

Usually, their answer to that question is, "Well, you still get to keep
*some* types of guns, but you know, those scary assault-type weapons, no
one should have those."

That's the compromise. You still get to keep some types of guns.

You and I both know that this is not the actual definition of
"compromise." That's because gun grabbers aren't really after compromise
when they talk about compromise. They're actually after complete and
total disarmament of the population. They can't admit to that because it
would totally destroy their platform. But it's true.
