**Content:** [It depends on the organization against which you have a
complaint. Most organizations have contact information available on
their website that you can write to and get your complaint addressed.
Check the bottom of their main company webpage for links like \"Contact
Us\" or similar.\
\
In the US, if the organization is a service company and you received
less-than-stellar service, you can write a review at a company like
[[Angie\'s
List](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=50ddcd&url=http://www.angieslist.com){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="angieslist.com"}]{.qlink_container} and other people looking
for organizations can reference the database and see your review.
Angie\'s List is a great one to belong to; they only accept reviews from
their members, so you pay to review companies. Once you do pay though,
you get access to their entire database of reviews. Companies very
carefully pay attention to sites like Angie\'s List because negative
reviews can cost them revenue.\
\
If the organization is one that you purchased from through an online
store like
[[Amazon.com](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=035057&url=http://www.amazon.com){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}, you can leave a review at
that site and it will influence the purchasing decisions that other
consumers make.]{.rendered_qtext}
