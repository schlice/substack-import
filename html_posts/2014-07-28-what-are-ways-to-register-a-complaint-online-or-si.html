<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [It depends on the organization against which you have a<br>complaint. Most organizations have contact information available on<br>their website that you can write to and get your complaint addressed.<br>Check the bottom of their main company webpage for links like \"Contact<br>Us\" or similar.\<br>\<br>In the US, if the organization is a service company and you received<br>less-than-stellar service, you can write a review at a company like<br>[[Angie\'s<br>List](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=50ddcd&url=http://www.angieslist.com){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="angieslist.com"}]{.qlink_container} and other people looking<br>for organizations can reference the database and see your review.<br>Angie\'s List is a great one to belong to; they only accept reviews from<br>their members, so you pay to review companies. Once you do pay though,<br>you get access to their entire database of reviews. Companies very<br>carefully pay attention to sites like Angie\'s List because negative<br>reviews can cost them revenue.\<br>\<br>If the organization is one that you purchased from through an online<br>store like<br>[Amazon.com(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=035057&url=http://www.amazon.com){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}, you can leave a review at<br>that site and it will influence the purchasing decisions that other<br>consumers make.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
