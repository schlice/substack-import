In the United States, you can sue anyone for anything. So the only
question that remains is how likely are you to prevail.

And as with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."

If you make an inappropriate song about *a specific child*, and you can
show that the child in question could be harmed by the song, you can sue
for the damage that will come to the child, as well as for defamation of
character.

If you make an inappropriate song about *unspecified children,* it's
unlikely that your lawsuit will prevail. There really aren't any decency
standards for music (except for broadcast music over the radio), so
saying that something is "inappropriate" is purely opinion. The last
attempt to do so was the Communications Decency Act of 1996, and much of
that was struck down so that only speech that was not subject to the
First Amendment was unlawful.

**TL;DR:** Most music is considered "artistic expression" or "artistic
works" and are thus protected under the First Amendment. It is unlikely
that suing someone for an inappropriate song would prevail, unless it is
an inappropriate song about a specific person.
