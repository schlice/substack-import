The answer is "it depends."

Each HOA's elections are governed by their Governing Documents: the
Declaration of Covenants, the Articles of Incorporation, and the Bylaws
for the corporation, as well as any Policies, Procedures, Rules and
Regulations (PPR&R) which may have been written and approved by the
Board.

The ability to which an HOA's election can be "rigged" is a function of
the specific rules for the election process in the Governing Documents,
as well as rules which may be in place for HOA elections in your state.

But *in general*, it's not easy to rig an HOA election. Usually, the
process by which the election takes place has some minimal security in
place. A disinterested third party (usually the management company) will
administer the election, collect the responses, and ensure there is only
one vote per household.
