**Content:** [\>It is evidently the case - as well as palpably obvious -
that fewer civilian owned guns will result in fewer civilian owned gun
related deaths; to argue otherwise is to admit ignorance\
\
You are arguing that gun deaths are somehow better to control than other
deaths, when in fact guns cause fewer deaths than the first three types
of murder combined.\
\
Guns are an easy target emotionally because guns are the only devices
purpose-built to kill. To say that we should eliminate guns means that
you believe that there are no legitimate reasons for killing, and this
is simply not true either. Killings are justified, as people walk free
from jail after having committed all types of killings. This happens
because of justification. If killings in any form can be justified, than
what difference does it make what tool I use?]{.rendered_qtext}
