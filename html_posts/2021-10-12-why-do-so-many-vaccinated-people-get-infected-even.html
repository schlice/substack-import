Because the vaccines don't prevent infection. They also don't prevent
you from spreading the virus to others.

Breakthrough infections are most generally mild. Some who get infected
after vaccination don't even know they are infected.

Original question:

Why do so many vaccinated people get infected, even several times?

*Feel free to comment, but if you think you're going to come into my
comments on my answers, pop off, and then block me, don't expect me to
keep your conversation around very long.*

*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is
grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,
downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora
is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you are simply
commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" don\'t be surprised
if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything vaguely harassing in
there, and your deletion will be followed by a block/mute, and a BNBR
report. I will do this immediately and with no compunction.*

*You have been warned. Be nice.*
