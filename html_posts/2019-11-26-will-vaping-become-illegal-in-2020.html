**Will vaping become illegal in 2020?**

*(United States answer)*

Across the country, I don't think so. However, individual states will
implement "common-sense" restrictions, like removing good flavors from
e-liquid so that you don't entice children to vape. Some states (I'm
looking at you, New York and California) could possibly ban vaping
altogether.

The science, however, does not comport with that decision.

The deaths from vaping were all found to have been linked to chemicals
in *illegal* e-liquid from China. The liquid was used not to transport
nicotine, but to transport THC, the active ingredient in marijuana.

Illegal vape cartridges containing THC also contain significant amounts
of vitamin E acetate. Because cannabis oil is expensive, producers use
the acetate to dilute and thicken it without affecting its flavor or
smell. But the vitamin's oil-like properties can cause respiratory
issues, including cough, shortness of breath and chest pain. 85% of the
deaths reported have been linked to vaping some form of THC. Since
marijuana is illegal at the federal level, the FDA cannot exercise any
oversight over the products themselves, which means they all exist,
unregulated, on the black market.

Unless and until marijuana is legalized at the federal level, black
market e-liquid will continue to exist, it will continue to be
unregulated, and people choosing to consume illegal vape liquid will
continue to die. No amount of restriction on vaping will stop that.
