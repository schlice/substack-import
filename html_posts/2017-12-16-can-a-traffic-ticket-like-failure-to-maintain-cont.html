In general, [[clerical errors (aka Scrivener\'s
Error](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=706c23&url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/c/clerical-error-scriveners-error-vitium-clerici/){.external_link

a ticket to be dismissed.

If a cop gets actual factual data wrong on your ticket, like the wrong
make or model of car, or the wrong street, this would speak directly to
the validity of the ticket. Also, if the cop writes down the wrong name,
or the wrong birthday, you could also similarly argue that the ticket
was not actually addressing you, or your violation, in your car.

However, the wrong date is simply considered a clerical error, and even
in Iowa, wouldn't cause a ticket to be automatically dismissed.
