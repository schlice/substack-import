**Is it rape if you didn\'t understand it? I\'m a girl and I was 9 and
my 14 year old female cousin made me preform inappropriate activities
with her. Is this rape? Does it count?**

Statutory rape laws are designed to protect children from adult
predators who wish to take advantage of their lack of understanding
about what they're doing.

While what you went through may have been inappropriate, in most states,
it is not rape, as both children were underage. Some states (such as
Utah) would prosecute *both* children for statutory rape. Most states,
however, consider it a juvenile offense and refer the matter to the
juvenile justice system.

Why do we have a separate legal system for juveniles instead of just
using the adult legal system?

It's well understood that the mind of a child is not fully developed.
The ability to perform higher reasoning functions isn't even fully
developed until age 25. In fact, recent research has even found that
adult and child brains work differently. Adults use the prefrontal
cortex for higher thinking. This is the rational part of the brain.
Because this is not fully developed in children, they use the amygdala,
which is not appropriate for higher thinking.

Crimes require two elements to be crimes: the *actus reus* (the guilty
act) and the *mens rea* (the guilty mind). Children cannot form *mens
rea* because they lack those critical thinking skills that adults have.

To this end, we have a separate justice system focused on rehabilitation
rather than punishment.
