Natural explanations which follow the scientific method cannot explain
the supernatural. That's why they are called "supernatural", or "beyond
the natural." Indeed, the most supernatural of events---the creation of
the entire universe and everything in it out of nothing---has already
occurred, and science cannot explain that. If you can believe that a
supernatural being can create the universe and everything in it out of
nothing, then believing the other miracles documented in the Bible
should be easy to do.

But to explain why YEC (young earth creationism) could actually have
merit, let's look at some other supernatural events documented in the
Bible.

The Bible says that Adam was created on the sixth day. So logically, on
the seventh day, he would have been one day old, right?

But he was not. He was a fully-formed human, equivalent to a born child
who lived for over 20 years.

In other words, **God pre-baked Adam's age into him when He created
him.**

***Just like He did with the earth.***

See, this isn't hard to parse. If you can believe in miracles (like the
creation of the earth out of nothing), then you can believe in YEC.
