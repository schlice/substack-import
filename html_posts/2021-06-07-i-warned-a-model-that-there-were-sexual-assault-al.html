Yes, you can be sued for slander. The question is, can he collect
damages.

In order for the photographer to collect damages from you, he has to
prove that your statement:

- was false,
- affected his business, trade or profession, and
- implies he committed a crime, or leads to the conclusion that he has a
  loathsome disease (such as a sexually transmitted disease).

But here's the trick: **the absolute defense to slander or libel charges
is the truth.** If, in fact, the photographer had sexual assault
allegations made against him, and those allegations can be proven, then
the statement you made was not false. Slander (spoken) or libel
(printed) require **knowingly passing on a false statement**. If the
statement is provably true, then slander does not apply.

Slander also only applies when the statement is a false statement *of
fact*. If you are passing on your opinion, such as if you told the model
that you believed the photographer was unprofessional, or you didn't
like working with him, these are not slanderous as they are statements
of opinion, not of fact. But because you said that the photographer had
a sexual assault allegation made against him (which is a statement of
fact), this part does not apply.

If the statement is **actually false**, however, the photographer could
collect if he can prove that your false statement affected his business.
