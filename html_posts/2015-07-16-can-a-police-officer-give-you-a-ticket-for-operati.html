**Content:** [It is a reasonable assumption to make that you drove the
car to that property. You didn\'t walk up on it and start filling it.
The presumption was made that you drove the car to that location. And
it\'s a service station; it\'s not private property, but a public
accommodation.\
\
If you were sitting in a car on your 40-acre ranch, you probably
couldn\'t get a ticket.\
\
Unless you can produce the person who drove the vehicle and explain
where they were when the police arrived and why they weren\'t present
the entire time you were receiving a ticket, it is a reasonable
assumption for the police to make that you drove the vehicle there.
Plus, even if you could produce the person who \"drove the vehicle
there,\" you\'d still have a missing insurance card charge to deal with.
You\'re out of luck either way.\
\
If I were you, I\'d follow [[Cliff
G.](https://www.quora.com/profile/Cliff-G-13)]{.qlink_container}\'s
advice and get your license renewed and get your insurance documents
updated and petition the court for a mitigation hearing to get your fine
lowered. You can absolutely get your fine lowered for the insurance card
charge, as that charge, in most states, is a dismissible offense,
provided you can show that you had insurance at the time, just an
invalid or missing card. You will still have to pay administrative fees
in most jurisdictions, but that fine can be dismissed. The license fine
might be reduced, but you\'re still going to have to pay something for
that offense.]{.rendered_qtext}
