Mostly because people can\'t stomach it anymore.

It is quick and virtually painless, as the spinal cord is cut first. So
it technically meets the criteria established by the courts as not
violating the 8th Amendment\'s restriction against cruel and unusual
punishment.

But as society has changed, and people have supposedly become more
civilized, the guillotine was deemed too "barbaric" for continued use.
