**How much money can an HOA charge a homeowner per month for pets
exceeding a weight limit?**

In general, fines for violating HOA R&Rs need to be "reasonable," but
they can charge you that reasonable amount up to daily, if they choose.
So instead of charging you per month, they can charge you per day for
violating certain rules.
