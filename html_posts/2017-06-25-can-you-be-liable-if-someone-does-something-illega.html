You are only liable if an *agent* of your organization does something in
your name. So if the counter clerk at McDonald\'s orders 200,000 buns
instead of 2,000, you are liable for that order, as the clerk is an
agent of the company.

If a *non-agent* does something on your behalf, you are not liable. So
if a hacker hacks your site and pretends to be you, you are not
responsible for what that hacker does.
