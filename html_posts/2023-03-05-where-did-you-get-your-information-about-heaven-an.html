I understand your questions, but you're coming at the problem from the
wrong direction.

As Christians, we have studied and researched the Bible. We know that
the Bible is the inspired word of God.

This is an important point, and you must understand that we as
Christians believe this. Since this answer isn't about proving the truth
of the Bible, to answer your question, you simply must understand that
Christians believe in the truth of the Bible.

Taking the logic further:

- The Bible is the inspired Word of God.
- The Bible discusses Heaven and Hell.
- Therefore, the message of Heaven and Hell comes from God.

> Since no one has ever come back from death, how did you find out?

Actually, two men have come back from the dead: Lazarus, and Jesus.
Lazarus was dead for four days, and Jesus was dead for three days,
before they were resurrected. This information is, once again, recorded
in the Bible. The statements of eyewitnesses were passed down until they
were written, which surprisingly didn't take all that long from the
actual events before they were recorded. At that time, things weren't
quickly written down. For example, the first writings about Alexander
the Great were written nearly 300 years after his death, while writings
of the resurrection of Jesus was written 40 years after His death
(although that archaeological writing fragment is currently disputed)
but was recorded by 10 *non-Christian* writers within 150 years of His
death and resurrection. Add onto that the number of Christian writers
detailing those events, and you have as much documentation about the
life, death, and resurrection of Jesus as was written about Tiberius
Caesar, the emperor at the time.
