**Content:** [I would start with motivation.\
\
What motivation would the bf have for doing this? Is he shy about
intercourse? You\'re already intimate (when you\'re conscious). It
doesn\'t seem like there would be much reason to do this.\
\
Now: what motivation would the teller have for telling? On the surface,
it would seem the teller is trying to protect you. But is she really?
Does she have an ulterior motive? Does that person want your bf for
herself? Is she trying to drive a wedge in between you and your bf? Is
she trying to make trouble?\
\
It seems to me that out of the two motivations we listed, the teller
trying to make trouble seems more likely.]{.rendered_qtext}
