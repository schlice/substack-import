**Should I call the police when I smell weed coming from the car ahead
of me? In other words, is driving while smoking weed considered as
legally wrong as driving while drinking? It seems to be happening more
and more. I live in Ohio, USA.**

Smoking cannabis in Ohio is illegal. It's only legal for medical use,
and it's only legal to be used as an edible, oil, vapor, patch, or
tincture.

Ohio also decriminalized possession of small amounts of marijuana. Any
amount under 100 grams is a minor misdemeanor, subject to a \$150 fine.

Police don't routinely stop cars for that. So it's unlikely that you'll
get a police response from simply smelling weed.

***However***, if you see a car that does not appear to be controlled in
a normal way (swerving, weaving into oncoming traffic, erratic
accelerator/braking actions, etc), you should call the police and report
that you think a driver is under the influence. Of what, you cannot be
sure, even though you may have smelled marijuana from the car, but you
can be sure that the vehicle is operating in an erratic manner. Do call
911 for that.
