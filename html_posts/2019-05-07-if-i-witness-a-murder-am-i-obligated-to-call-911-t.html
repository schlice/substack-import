**If I witness a murder am I obligated to call 911 to report it?**

In the vast majority of states in the United States, no, failure to
report is not a crime. A small group of states have written some failure
to report laws for some crimes. For example, it is a Class A misdemeanor
in Texas to fail to report any crime which results in bodily injury or
death. Ohio has made it illegal to fail to report a felony.

Mandatory reporting is usually only applicable for crimes against
children, and usually only for people in professional fields related to
or who work with children, such as police officers, doctors, nurses,
school administrators, social workers, etc.
