**Now that weed is legal in many states, are people in law enforcement
jobs still expected to not have smoked in the last seven years?**

Absolutely yes.

First, not all agencies have the same requirements for employment. Seven
years since you have last smoked could be the rule for one agency, but
not another. There's no "universal" rule surrounding marijuana. Unless
you're applying for a *federal* law enforcement position, which is
required to follow *federal* law, in which case marijuana is still
illegal.

Second, we need to define our terms a little here. We like to
"colloquially" say that "marijuana is legal," but it's actually not. As
I just mentioned, it's still illegal at the federal level, and no state
law can make it legal. *But, but, it's legal in Colorado! It's legal in
Washington state!* Well, it's actually not.

Would you believe me if I told you that it's actually still illegal in
those states?

*But\...but...but...*

Now, before you have a brain aneurysm over this, because a state can't
make something legal that the federal government has made illegal, what
the states *can* do is to remove any penalties for violating the law.
States have *decriminalized* possession and use of marijuana. Some
states have made it a misdemeanor, and other states (Colorado included)
have removed all penalties for possession and/or use of marijuana. There
are still laws surrounding it, but the laws for possession or use of
marijuana have had all of their penalties removed. State Constitutional
amendments have done this, so they're unlikely to change any time soon.

And just because it's not a punishable crime doesn't mean that an agency
can't regulate its use. There is still a lot we don't know about the
long-term effects of smoking. We don't know how it affects the brain, or
memory, or reflexes, or anything else, over the long term. And for
something for which we have such a dearth of actual, scientific
knowledge, it's right to still have rules around whether or not you've
used it, or possibly used it recently.

This is even more true for law enforcement officers. Because we have so
little precedent on the use of this drug, the scenario could be raised
by defense attorneys in court cases that an officer was adversely
affected by previous marijuana use and no one would be able to contest
that with actual scientific data. Departments are loathe to take those
kinds of risks, and that reality is reflected in their hiring practices.
