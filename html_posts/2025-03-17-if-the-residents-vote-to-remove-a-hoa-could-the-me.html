Once the residents vote to dissolve a mandatory HOA, the members can go
through the process to re-establish a new HOA following the rules of
that state to establish an HOA in an existing community which does not
have one.

It's two separate processes: one to dissolve a mandatory HOA, and
another to establish a new HOA.

**But no one in their right mind would ever do this, because you're
literally doubling the legal cost.**

It seems like you're asking whether or not one group of homeowners can
dissolve an HOA and another group of residents bring it back. And within
the boundaries of that particular question, the answer is no.

The reason is that because each one of those discreet actions
(dissolving an HOA or forming a new HOA) either requires a
**supermajority** or **unanimous** support. And if you have a
supermajority of homeowners voting to dissolve an HOA, you're not going
to find another supermajority of the same homeowners voting to once
again create an HOA.

The people doing the voting for either dissolving or forming an HOA are
*the affected homeowners*. No one else votes to dissolve an existing
HOA, or votes to establish an HOA where one did not exist.
