**Content:** [The powered airplane, as we know it, was invented by
Orville and Wilbur Wright. The first flight of the *Wright Flyer I* took
place on December 17, 1903, in Kitty Hawk, NC. It flew for 120 feet, and
is regarded as the first recorded flight of an \"airplane.\" They
flipped a coin, and Orville took the first flight.\
\
Samuel Pierpont Langley built another aircraft earlier in 1903 called
the *Aerodrome,* but his tests at powered flight over the Potomac were
unsuccessful. Glenn Curtiss heavily modified the design of the
*Aerodrome* and successfully flew it in 1914. The Smithsonian used
Curtiss\' flight in 1914 as the basis to award Langley (the former
Secretary of the Institute) the honor of having his machine, the
*Aerodrome,* listed as the first heavier-than-air machine \"capable\" of
flight. Later, under new direction, the Smithsonian published a list of
Curtiss\' modifications to the *Aerodrome* and rescinded its earlier
pronouncement, pronouncing the *Flyer* as the first heavier-than-air
machine capable of flight. The Wrights were then allowed to return the
*Flyer* to America, and to the Smithsonian, after having it on display
in the Science Museum in London.]{.rendered_qtext}
