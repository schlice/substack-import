The President would have to have some very long arms, or he would have
had to lunge a really long way, in order to reach the Secret Service
agent driving the Beast.

So this one is really easy to debunk.

(EDIT) So assuming that he actually took the armored SUV and not the
Beast limo, the Secret Service testified that \'You have to slightly be
a contortionist to get from the back cabin to the front cabin, and the
president\'s not a contortionist.

\'It\'s ridiculous. I mean, it\'s not a pretty sight. It\'s not
impossible, right? I just, I don\'t see this president ever being able
to do that. Ever.\'

In other words, they testified that the president's "girth" would have
made it impossible for him to reach from the back cabin to the front
cabin, and the president was not in a physical state to make that reach.
