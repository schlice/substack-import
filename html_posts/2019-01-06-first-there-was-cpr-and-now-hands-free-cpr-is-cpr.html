**First there was CPR and now hands free CPR. Is CPR really useful?**

CPR is extremely useful, but you've stated a common misnomer.

It's not "hands-free CPR." It's actually [[Hands Only
CPR](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2ac8c3&url=https://cpr.heart.org/AHAECC/CPRAndECC/Programs/HandsOnlyCPR/UCM_473196_Hands-Only-CPR.jsp){.external_link

What they have found is that the rescue breaths are actually much less
needed than the chest compressions. In fact, if you do only the chest
compressions, you can effect a very good lifesaving technique.

The new CPR mantra to remember:

The rhythm used to be what you could compress to the beat of "Stayin'
Alive" in your head (about 60 compressions a minute). You actually want
to go slightly faster than that (now around 100 to 120 compressions a
minute, which means faster than one compression a second, up to maybe
two pushes a second). The new mantra: push hard and fast.

You want to continue compressions (i.e. do not stop) until one of two
things happens:

- The person basically says, "OK, that's enough, get off of me" (which
  means they're conscious and breathing on their own),
- Paramedics arrive and relieve you.

Coughing and sputtering do not mean that the person's heart is beating
independently and they are fully functioning on their own. Continue
compressions! Only stop when help arrives, or the person basically swats
you off of them.

If you haven't taken a Red Cross CPR and First Aid class, you should.
They will teach you the technique and let you try it out on a
Resusci-Annie doll which accurately simulates what you'll feel when
compressing a chest in this way.
