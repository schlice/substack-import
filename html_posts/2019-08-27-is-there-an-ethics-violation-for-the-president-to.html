**Is there an Ethics violation for the President to have the next G7
summit at one of his hotels?**

This is a great question, and it's related to all the questions which
talk about the President and the Emoluments clause.

So let's just clear this up real quick: *The framers never expected
there to ever be career politicians.*

They expected someone to leave their farm, or their business, come to
Washington, serve their time, and then return to their farms and their
businesses.

To that end, the Constitution does not forbid a businessman from
becoming a politician. It doesn't even forbid that businessman from
continuing to make money.

But if the President is *personally enriching himself* by using his
authority to set a conference at a hotel *he owns* and then charging
premium prices to all the attendees, while not illegal and not an
Emoluments Clause violation, it could be seen as an *abuse of power* or
an abuse of the office of the President. Setting policy with the aim of
*personally enriching yourself* would definitely be an abuse of office
and would result, not in a violation of law, but in ***impeachment.***

Even if the President took due care to charge the attendees the same
rates as other hotel guests, or even if he gave the attendees a
*discount* on room rates, the simple fact that he had the opportunity to
set the conference anywhere, and he chose to use one of his namesake
properties, simply looks too suspicious.

Abusing the office of the President for personal gain is an impeachable
offense, not a Constitutional violation.
