They can overturn *Roe*, but "outlawing abortion at a national level?" I
would be absolutely horrified. Because that would mean that SCOTUS was
*writing new law* and that's not their job. Only Congress can "outlaw
abortion at a national level" by writing law. SCOTUS cannot do that.

*At best*, they can say that a particular law, as it is written, is
unconstitutional. So let's say that SCOTUS ruled that *Roe v. Wade*, as
written, is unconstitutional. That simply means that there is no longer
a Constitutional right to an abortion.

Does that automatically make all abortions illegal? **No, not at all**.

It simply means that there is no Constitutional protection for it. And
states can now make laws which make all abortions illegal, if they so
choose.

Most states won't do this. Most states will set a *limit* as to how long
into a baby's development an elective abortion will be allowed, and then
after that point, elective abortion will no longer be allowed and the
baby must be carried to term (with the exception of medical necessity of
course).

Some states will impose no restrictions on abortions at all (California,
New York, etc).

So instead of being a Constitutionally-protected right, it will fall to
the states to decide how they want it to go in their state.
