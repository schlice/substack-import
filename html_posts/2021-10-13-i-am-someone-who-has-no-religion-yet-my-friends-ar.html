I'm confused. Why do you want to have a religion? Is it like the latest
cool accessory? Does it go well with fall fashions?

Or are you starting to feel like there is more to our existence
than...this? Are you starting to feel like there has to be more to life
than just living for a little while and dying? Are you feeling like
there has to be some meaning to life?

If that's the case, then it is worth checking out religion.

I will tell you only this: Christianity is the only religion in which
you don't have to earn your way into Heaven. Your salvation is a gift,
freely given and offered to you. You can do nothing to earn your place
in God's kingdom.

Every other religion requires some life action on your part in order to
earn your salvation.

Think about that when you are evaluating which religion might be true.

Original question:

I am someone who has no religion yet, my friends are telling me to be a
Christian and some are teling me to be Muslim. I want to have a
religion. Islam makes more sense but I am not sure which one to convert
to? I need to be convinced on a side...
