**Why did Trump break with decades of tradition for presidential
candidates by refusing to release his income tax filings during his 2016
campaign?**

Because he's not a career politician.

Career politicians structure their finances so that they'll look good on
a 1040. No one else does this, because no one else has a need to do
this.

Trump has no need to disclose his tax filings because the law says that
they are between him and the IRS. There may be tradition of career
politicians voluntarily disclosing their tax returns, but there is no
law requiring a candidate to do so.

And making a law requiring candidates to do so will simply encourage
fewer non-career politicians from engaging in the political sphere. You
may think that's a good thing. I do not.

So do you think he's hiding something? Probably. What's he hiding? He's
probably hiding exactly how much he donates to charity. He's probably
hiding details about his companies (which are still in operation),
disclosure of which could financially harm those existing entities.

None of those things are required to be known by anyone but Trump and
the IRS.

Don't like it? Don't vote for him. Simple as that.
