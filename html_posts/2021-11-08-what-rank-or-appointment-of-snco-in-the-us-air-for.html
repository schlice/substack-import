*(NOTE: Any gender pronouns used in the answer are only for ease of
illustration: TSgts can be any gender)*

**Technical Sergeant (TSgt) - E-6**

It's actually not five chevrons. It's three *stripes* and two *rockers*,
for a total of 5 lines. The rank insignia looks like this:

:::: ui_qtext_image_outer
::: qtext_image_wrapper
![](images/qimg-62fa69cfa3ccb52e4aef9e276e6f36e7){.landscape

master_src="images/qimg-62fa69cfa3ccb52e4aef9e276e6f36e7" master_w="800"
master_h="752"}

This position is a senior Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO). He or she is
technically proficient, and has been working at his job for several
years. The average time in service before a Staff Sergeant is promoted
to Technical Sergeant is 12 years. The TSgt is usually a shift lead or a
shift supervisor, with several lower-grade Airmen and NCOs who work for
him.

The next rank above this is Master Sergeant (MSgt), and the rank
insignia would add a single *chevron* over the top:

master_h="599"}
