First of all, I dispute your very first statement: "for there to be
religion, there must be tenets."

Says who?

Where is there a universal determination of what constitutes a religion?
Because if "tenets" are the only requirement, then most businesses which
have mission and vision statements (which are indeed tenets of
operation) should also qualify as a religion.

So let's break down the comparison between atheism and theism (which we
all implicitly agree is a religion) and see if there are any
comparisons. Let's look at some defining characteristics of a theistic
religion and see if atheism (a specifically non-theistic practice) could
be considered a religion:

- **Saints.** Saints are people who were important leaders in their
  religion that have died but are remembered for their contributions.
  Atheism has these: Christopher Hitchens, Carl Sagan, David Hume, etc.
- **Preachers.** Preachers are people who stand on the stage and deliver
  a message to those with similar beliefs. Atheism has these: Richard
  Dawkins, Sam Harris, Matt Dillahunty, etc.
- **Core texts.** Core texts (which are sacred or holy in theistic
  religions) are books or literature written by man that claims to tell
  its readers important truths about their beliefs. Atheists most
  definitely have these: *The God Delusion, God is Not Great, The End of
  Faith,* etc*.*
- **Blasphemy.** Blasphemy would be acts or statements that are so
  offensive to their religion that they might cause emotion or anger in
  the listener. To see if blasphemy exists in atheism, try this: tell an
  atheist that God exists, and if the atheist is emotional or upset at
  hearing this, does that not imply the atheist feels he is being
  blasphemed against? Just wait for the comments section and you'll see
  what I mean by exposing blasphemy. Which leads me directly to...
- **Apologetics.** The definition of apologetics is "debate and
  argumentation that attempts to defend a religious belief against
  attack." There\'s a reason all the atheists are about to swarm the
  comments section: *to defend their religious beliefs*. If they truly
  believe in nothing (if they truly have a lack of belief in god), then
  there is no reason to defend nothing. Definitionally, "nothing" needs
  no defense, as it doesn't exist. A lack of belief does not need to be
  defended. Me blathering on about nothing shouldn't even be noteworthy.
  It should be nothing worth commenting on. So by responding, atheists,
  you are demonstrating the presence of something which is worthy of
  defense. And that can't be "nothing."
- **Churches.** Church is traditionally defined as a building (e.g. I
  went to church), but as was demonstrated during Covid, the church
  clearly identified that it is not a building, but a collection of
  like-minded people with similar beliefs. Do not atheists have this?
  American Atheists? Atheist Alliance International? Freedom From
  Religion Foundation? Do not these organizations meet periodically to
  discuss insights about their beliefs? Sounds a lot like a non-theistic
  church to me.

Also, **atheists can have** ***degrees of belief*** **just as theists
can.** Not all atheists follow atheism religiously, just as not all
theists follow theism religiously. For example, just as some Christians
might not go to church, listen to pastors, or know the Bible very well,
they can still be somewhat religious, or even not religious at all,
while still believing in the core philosophy of their religion. In fact,
people tell me all the time that they are Christian while either not
acting like a Christian, or *even while holding non-Christian beliefs.*
In precisely the same way, an atheist may not know anything about
important and influential atheist figures, or associate with atheist
organizations, or go out seeking to engage in debate or apologetics
about atheism, and still just hold a quiet and private belief that God
does not exist.

With this in mind, I'd say that for these reasons, atheism is indeed a
non-theistic religion.
