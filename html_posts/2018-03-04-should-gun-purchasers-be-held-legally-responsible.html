I think I fall somewhere in between a simple yes or no answer here.

First of all, I can't see charging the gun owner for the crimes of
someone who steals the gun and uses it maliciously. That is patently
absurd. The only person responsible for the act committed with the gun
is the person holding it and pulling the trigger. No one else bears any
responsibility for *that* act.

Now, if you go through the process of mandating safe storage and
requiring gun owners to lock their firearms up (which *Heller* already
said was unconstitutional, but if you somehow hypothetically did it),
and you didn't follow those safe storage laws, and your gun was stolen
and used in a crime, while you can't be held responsible for that crime,
you can then be charged with some sort of contributory negligence for
violating the safe storage laws which then aided in the commission of a
crime.

**TL;DR: If we pass safe storage laws, owners can then be charged under
those laws. Otherwise, gun owners should not be charged for the crimes
of others who steal their guns and use them maliciously.**
