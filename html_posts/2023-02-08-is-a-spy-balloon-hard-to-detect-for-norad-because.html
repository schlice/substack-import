So your two criteria for believing that a spy balloon is difficult to
detect are:

- altitude, and
- construction

So let's discuss those one at a time.

**Altitude**. NORAD's phased array radar stations positioned along the
coast are designed to primarily track missile launches. They can track
missiles which arc outside of the atmosphere, so altitude is usually not
a factor in our tracking ability. They also can track satellites, so
again it is unlikely that the radar does not have the range to track the
balloon. Our space-based IR systems which track the heat signature from
a rocket plume are not a factor here, so dual phenomenology is not
applicable..

Additionally, the balloon was approximately 200 feet tall while aloft,
and the tech package hanging from the bottom was the size of a regional
jetliner. If PARCS radars can track satellites about that size, they can
absolutely track the balloon. Essentially, what flew overhead was a
satellite attached to a heliostat weather balloon.

**Construction of balloon**. The contention is that the balloon itself
is only made of PVC and vinyl, so it cannot be detected on radar. This
may be true for the balloon portion, but this is not true for the tech
package hanging below it. As I said, it's basically a satellite
suspended under a weather balloon. While the balloon may provide a
limited radar return, the tech package would not.
