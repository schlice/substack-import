This is a two-part question.

> **How can Donald Trump obstruct justice?**

Trump can indeed obstruct justice. If you'd like to know how, let's look
at how some other presidents obstructed justice. Clinton did it when he
tried to influence potential witnesses to not tell the truth. Nixon did
it; he paid hush money, he told people to lie, he destroyed evidence. It
is indeed possible for presidents to obstruct justice. Trump can
obstruct justice in this way, too.

> **His lawyer Dowd says that Trump is not guilty of obstruction of
> justice according to the Constitution.**

So the question here is: did Trump obstruct justice by firing Comey? Did
Trump obstruct justice by saying that he wished the whole Flynn thing
would go away quickly?

The short answer is **no**.

The President has the authority to direct how the Justice Department
investigates cases, and he has the authority to fire the director of the
FBI, under Article II.

**It cannot be obstruction of justice if you are exercising your power
under the Constitution,** ***even if you do it specifically to avoid
your own prosecution!***

Case in point: George H.W. Bush did it. He pardoned Casper Weinberger to
forestall the investigation that would have eventually implicated him.
No one talked about obstruction of justice then.

Trump *could have* done the same thing here! ***He could have pardoned
Mike Flynn!*** He has the power to pardon Flynn, but he chose not to. If
Flynn was pardoned, he wouldn't have to cooperate with the Special
Counsel. ***But he didn't!*** That alone should tell you that there is
no obstruction of justice.
