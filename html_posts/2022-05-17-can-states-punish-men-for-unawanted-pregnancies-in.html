Why are we trying to *punish* *anyone* for an unwanted pregnancy? You
said "punish men for unwanted pregnancies in light of Roe v. Wade being
overturned" and if I'm reading your intent correctly, what you're really
saying is "now that abortion is no longer a right protected by the
Constitution, I may not be able to abort my unwanted baby, so SOMEONE
has to pay for that perceived injustice."

The only reason why someone might need to be punished is if the sex was
not consensual, and we already punish that, as it's called rape.

See, here's the problem we are facing. People are under the false belief
that you can consent to sex but you can *not consent* to pregnancy. This
is illogical, and is not valid thinking.

In order to understand this, you have to understand what *consent* is.
Consent is a process which involves three things:

- A person requesting permission
- A person granting permission
- A thing which is being requested

In the case of sex, you can consent to sex. There is a person requesting
sex, and a person granting permission to sex.

**Pregnancy is not a condition which is subject to consent.** It's a
natural body process and is a natural consequence of sexual intercourse.
You can no more "consent" to pregnancy than you can "consent" to your
stomach processing your last meal. You can *assent* to eating food (you
can't even "consent" to eating food, as there aren't two people
involved), but you can't consent to your stomach processing that food.
"I can eat the food, but I do not consent to my stomach processing the
meal." Seems a little absurd, don't you think?

How can you *consent* to pregnancy? To whom would you be granting
consent? Your uterus? The baby? The baby is not in a condition to which
it can request permission to use your uterus for 9 months. Pregnancy is
a natural body process, and is the well-known outcome of sex.

The only action, therefore, you can consent to, is sex. Therefore, if
you consent to sex, you consent to all of the things that your body
automatically does with that consent, which includes pregnancy.

In other words, in order to not consent to pregnancy, you must not
consent to the action which causes pregnancy.

Trying to say that you consent to sex but you don't consent to pregnancy
goes against biology, and unless we enter a *Brave New World* scenario
where sex is free and pregnancy is specifically limited to certain women
who still have a functioning uterus, we're not going to be able to parse
that any more granularly than the consent to sex as the lowest level of
consent.

With all of that understanding, you can see that pregnancy isn't
anyone's "fault" other than biology's. Birth control is never 100%
guaranteed to work, so when you willingly consent to sex, you at least
take on the responsibility that it may result in pregnancy. You
certainly don't have to be a *mother*. Safe haven laws in all 50 states
allow women to give up their newborns for adoption, even days after they
are born, no questions asked. But you already consented to sex, which
implies that you consented to everything that comes along with sex,
including the possibility of pregnancy.

Cue the shrieking harpies shouting "My body, my choice" in 3, 2, 1......

I agree with you, you absolutely have a choice! To me though, the only
choice you have happens long before the pregnancy ever occurs.

Original question:

Can states punish men for unawanted pregnancies in light of Roe v. Wade
being overturned? Shouldn\'t the men who made such a critical mistake
have some responsibility as well?
