**Content:** [You have no idea why He is keeping you alive.\
\
I get that feeling.\
\
I know a former hard core drug dealer here in town who was up on meth
for like 19 days, fell asleep at the wheel, and jumped her car off of an
overpass. Amazingly, she lived. Long story short, she got clean and is
now a successful businesswoman and a pastor. She ministers to other
people who are where she was 10+ years ago. And He\'s still not done
with her!\
\
The hardest thing for a believer to do is to recognize *and accept* that
He really has a plan for your life, and that you have to trust Him to
lead you down the path that He desires for you.]{.rendered_qtext}
