A lot of people are talking about turning your basement into a "kitchen"
by not putting things like sinks, stoves, and refrigerators down there.

I would submit to you that you need to check your zoning ordinances much
more closely.

In Colorado (in El Paso County specifically), the only item that turns a
"kitchenette" or a "wet bar" into a "full kitchen" is a stove/cooktop. I
know; I finished my basement in Colorado and installed a beverage fridge
alongside a bar sink, and even that did not create anything more than
what is called a "wet bar." What made it a "kitchen" in Colorado's case
was the stove.

But the reason is exactly like everyone here said: if you are living in
a "single family housing" zoned area, you can only have one common
kitchen in the house. An attempt to make a second "kitchen" is generally
viewed as an attempt to make a separate living area which could be used
for "multi family housing," which would violate the zoning in that area.
