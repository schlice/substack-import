The word "genealogies" in Titus doesn't refer to people making family
trees. It refers to a genealogical practice which was going on in Paul's
time: **using lineage to create false authority**.

During Paul's time, there were many apostate teachers who would recite
their lineage to give their teaching more credibility. For the same
reason, other apostate teachers would manufacture a lineage out of whole
cloth. This practice caused a great deal of controversy among the Jews
and the Gentiles, and this was the practice that Paul was warning
against, not necessarily creating a family tree or investigating who
your ancestors were.

It's okay to have pride in your family tree. But you shouldn't use your
genealogy to attempt to make yourself look better or more important.
