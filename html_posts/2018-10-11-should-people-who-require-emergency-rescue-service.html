**Should people who require emergency rescue services as a result of
their own poor judgement be required to pay the cost of the rescue?**

People should only be required to reimburse agencies for rescue costs
when they violated a law which got them into the situation which
required rescue. For example, if they were in a prohibited area, and
they required rescue from that area, there should be some level of
culpability and they should have to reimburse a portion of the rescue
costs.

However, you said as a result of "poor judgement." Does this mean that I
go hiking and I think the weather is going to be fine based on all the
information I have available, and then the weather turns? I should have
know that the weather was going to turn. Is that "poor judgement?"

We really don't want the government getting into the business of
determining whether or not someone's judgement is faulty without a court
of law. This is why we have laws in the first place: to establish when
you are, and are not, in compliance with them.

If a law exists, and you violate it, and because of your violation you
require emergency rescue services, you should be liable for at least
part of the rescue costs.
