The First Amendment has been conflated to grant you the right to express
whatever opinion you choose to express.

The First Amendment, however, says nothing about the **consequences** of
your expression.

*Just because you have the right to say it does not absolve you of the
judgement that will most assuredly follow you based on what you say.*

Or like I tell my kids all the time: *Just because you* ***can***
*doesn't mean you* ***should.***

Your employer may look at your speech and determine that your character
and your personality is simply not as good a fit as they originally
thought in their company. Especially in employment, most work is what is
known as "at-will employment." This means that either side in the
working arrangement (worker and employer) can choose to terminate the
working relationship at any time, for nearly any reason. So long as the
termination does not violate the Employment section of the Civil Rights
Act (employment cannot be terminated due to race, color, religion, sex,
or national origin) or any state or local EEO laws, you can be
terminated without cause at any time. In most cases, if you were full
time, this also means you qualify for unemployment benefits which might
help you while you search for a new job, but the employer does have the
right to terminate at any time, just as you have the right to quit at
any time.

New York, California and Washington, DC have specific employment laws
that protect you from discrimination based on political activity or
political affiliation. Colorado and North Dakota protect you from
employment discrimination based on "lawful conduct outside of work." But
beyond that, the federal guidelines are normally followed by the states
when it comes to political views.
