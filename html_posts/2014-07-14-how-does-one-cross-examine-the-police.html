**Content:** [A few things to remember.\
\
1. You always have control over police encounters, and you have many
legal remedies. However, in the VAST majority of instances, ***NONE OF
THEM HAPPEN AT THE SCENE!*** Do not be belligerent during the incident.
Ever. It only makes things worse for you. Always be polite and
compliant.\
\
I say this from experience on both sides of the badge. When the officer
is on the scene, the officer is in charge. You\'re not going to convince
anyone, especially the officer, that he\'s wrong and that he should go
away. If the officer tells you to jump, say \"Yes, officer\" and jump.
If the officer tells you to quack like a chicken, while it may make you
look like a goofball, I\'d squawk like the dickens and then sue the
living sh1t out of the department if it were illegal for him to tell me
to do that. Then, I\'d do what they do, keep tacking charges on.
Unlawful detention, unlawful traffic stop, conduct unbecoming an
officer, and on and on. If the officer tells you to do something that is
illegal, it\'s okay and it\'s on him because he told you to do it and he
has the authority to tell you to do something illegal. If it\'s *illegal
for him to tell you to do it*, meaning if he doesn\'t have the authority
to tell you to do it, that\'s where you get him. But I digress. My main
point is: while you are at the scene, don\'t disobey orders. Swallow
your pride and do what you are told, period. Just think of how good that
juicy, fat check is going to feel in your hand when you win your
lawsuit.\
\
The officer wants the incident to go down smoothly, and so do you. So
don\'t give him any reason to make it happen otherwise. Roid-heads who
are looking to make trouble for citizens are few and far between these
days; relics from a different time in this country. Today\'s law
enforcement is highly educated, and does more damage with words and a
Taser than with a night stick and fists.\
\
2. When the incident is over, DOCUMENT, DOCUMENT, DOCUMENT! Write down
everything you remember, in as much detail as possible:
who/what/when/where/why/how. At 12:34 PM, I moved into the living room
and sat on the couch. At 12:35 PM, I observed my son enter the room. At
12:36 PM, I heard a vehicle enter the driveway. I observed a \'05 Honda
CR-V, CO reg ABC-123, color blue, one occupant, enter the driveway. Or
details about the officer, the statements he made, etc. If I were pulled
over, I might even start the recorder on my cell phone so I can capture
the events from the stop in detail. The officer is recording the stop on
his dash cam, no reason I can\'t do the same.\
\
3. If I received a summons, I\'m going to court. There\'s none of this
\"admit guilt and pay the fine\" business. Tear the incident down, look
at every detail. You know that the officer\'s chain of command is doing
the same thing. During discovery, subpoena the officer\'s training
records, the vehicle maintenance records, the radar gun calibration
records, etc. Make sure that everything meets both department policy and
manufacturer\'s specifications. If the radar gun wasn\'t calibrated
within the proper time period, a speeding ticket using that gun can be
thrown out. If the officer hasn\'t received the proper refresher
training on the equipment he is using, the ticket can be dismissed.
Question everything.\
\
Can this strategy backfire? Absolutely! If you look like you\'re wasting
the judge\'s time and the court\'s time, the judge will allow the ticket
to stand as is, and you\'ll have to pay for it anyway, but that\'s the
worst that can happen.\
\
However, if you are respectful of the court and the court\'s time and
resources, you have a Constitutional right to defend yourself. You have
a right to review all of the information and if any of it is incorrect,
it could be grounds to dismiss the charges or at least have the fine
reduced.\
\
Now, all that said, I can tell you that the police have their ducks in a
row and it would be an oversight if something like that happened, not
standard operating procedure. So while you\'ll definitely be rowing
upstream, you have every right to do so.]{.rendered_qtext}
