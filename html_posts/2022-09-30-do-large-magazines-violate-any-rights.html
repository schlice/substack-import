No, large magazines do not violate any rights.

But the question becomes, what is "large?"

To a gun owner, "large" means "anything which greatly exceeds the
standard magazine designed for the firearm"

To a gun control advocate, "large" means "whatever I think is too many."

So a 100-round magazine is probably too large for an M-4, but not too
large for a SAW. But a 30-round magazine is just right for an M-4,
because that's the standard magazine for that firearm.

However, if we're talking about my Springfield XD-S compact .45 EDC
pistol, the "standard" magazine doesn't allow me to grip with my full
hand; my pinky barely catches the bottom of the grip. However, I can
replace the standard mag with the "extended" mag, get one extra round,
and have a place to rest my pinky, thus providing me with a better grip.
So does that make the "extended" magazine "large?"

Ultimately, I go back to my original point, the large magazine doesn't
violate anyone's rights. I'd argue that in some cases, the standard
magazine violates my right to grip my firearm firmly.
