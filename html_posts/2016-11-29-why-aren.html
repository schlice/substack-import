You are an interesting dichotomy. You own a firearm, a device
specifically designed to kill living beings (humans, animals, etc), and
you don't know if you could live with the thought of killing someone?

You have two choices:

1.  Learn to live with killing someone if it comes down to it
2.  Sell your firearm.

Don't keep it in the home if you're not prepared to use it. Use the
money to buy a good Taser. There are many models to choose from, and
they are legal to carry in most states (check your local laws before
carrying one, though. They're not legal to carry everywhere).
