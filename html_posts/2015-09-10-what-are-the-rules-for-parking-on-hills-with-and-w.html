**Content:** [If you\'re talking about *law*, parking on a hill is no
different than parking on level ground. If it is not designated a no
parking area, you can park there.\
\
If you\'re talking about parking *safely*, there are a few things to
remember. This assumes you\'re in a right-hand drive country, parking on
the right shoulder. The reverse is true for a left-hand drive country.\
]{.rendered_qtext}

- If you\'re parking along a curb, how you cut your wheels depends on
  whether or not your car is facing uphill or downhill. If your car is
  facing *downhill,* cut your wheels to the *right, into the curb.* If
  your car is facing *uphill*, cut your wheels to the *left, away from
  the curb.* If your car starts to roll, cutting your wheels like this
  will cause them to catch on the curb and hopefully prevent the car
  from rolling away.
- If the shoulder has no curb, *always cut your wheels to the right,
  whether you are facing uphill, or downhill.* In this way, if your car
  starts to roll your car will either roll forward (facing downhill) or
  will roll backwards (facing uphill) and off the road and not into
  traffic.

- Always set your parking brake and move the gearshift into Park (for an
  automatic) or into first gear (for a manual) and turn off the engine.
