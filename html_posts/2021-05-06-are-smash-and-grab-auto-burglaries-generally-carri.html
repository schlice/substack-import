Everything. Answer the who/what/when/where/how questions. Remember
details: what they were wearing, what their hair looked like, how they
walked, if you heard them say anything, what it appeared they may have
taken, etc. Anything and everything you can remember.

Including the plate of the car you saw them drive off in. Sure it may be
stolen, but they can still track it down.
