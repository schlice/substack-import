<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [The fine is based on the offense, not the ability to pay
it. The 14th Amendment says the law must be applied equally to all
people. That means you can\'t discriminate in your application of the
law, no matter how much more fair it might be to fine the rich person
more.\
\
Taxes are specifically authorized by Constitutional amendment to be as
they are. If you want speeding tickets to match taxes, you will
similarly have to pass a Constitutional Amendment to do
it.]{.rendered_qtext}
