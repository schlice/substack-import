**Does a Presidential Pardon apply to other crimes which are uncovered
during the investigation of the pardoned crime?**

A Presidential pardon only applies to Federal crimes, but when it does
apply, it is limited to the subject crime only. It does not have to be
limited in time though; a pardon can be for any "past" or "future"
conviction for that specific crime.

Other crimes, including the same crime at the state level, can still be
charged.
