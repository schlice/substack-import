**If you tried to shoot someone without knowing the gun just had blanks,
would you be charged with attempted murder?**

Yes. You fit all the elements of the crime, except for the unlawful
termination of a life. You even took an action in furtherance of the
crime (you discharged a gun in someone's direction, even though it was
only loaded with blanks, which you did not know).

So for example, if I gave you a gun and told you it was loaded, and you
fired it at someone, you could be charged with attempted murder.

As far as your *mens rea*, you were in the appropriate state of mind to
be a murderer, even though you failed to complete the *actus reus*.
