[[Eric

is on the right track here. I can\'t see this particular video *not*
being staged; nevertheless, there is no law against kissing in public.

The OP may be thinking of something more along the lines of department
policy that may discourage PDA (public displays of affection) while in
uniform, or while on duty. To be fair, I am not aware of any such
policy. I *am* aware of policies that require officers to *not* do
things that would *not* bring credit to the department. Whether or not
any particular action brought credit or discredit to the department
would entirely be up to the sole discretion of the department.
