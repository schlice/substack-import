**Content:** [Hijacking aircraft, and the attitudes surrounding it, have
been the biggest changes in the aviation industry.\
\
Before 9/11, a hijacker would \"take over\" an aircraft by holding the
pilot hostage and demanding the plane be flown to a particular location.
The plane would be met at the destination airport by police, a hostage
situation would ensue, and the hijacker would either surrender to police
or be killed. Easy peesey.\
\
9/11 completely changed the attitude towards hijackers, and completely
changed the security posture inside of an aircraft. During the 9/11
attacks, instead of taking the pilots hostage and demanding they fly to
some location, the hijackers *killed* the pilots and took over control
of flying the aircraft, to turn the aircraft into human-guided missiles.
This was a quantum shift in the hijacking game, one which changed the
face of in-aircraft security, and changed the way we think about
hijackers.\
\
Have you noticed that not too many planes have been hijacked since 9/11?
The incidence of hijackers on aircraft has dropped substantially, and
9/11 is the proximate cause of that change. Cockpit security has been
dramatically increased, and any attempts at incursion into the cockpit
have been met with violent and swift response, binding any attackers
until the aircraft can make its first emergency landing to remove the
unruly passenger. Even drunkards on aircraft are dealt with more harshly
now. There is very little tolerance these days for un-gentlemanlike or
un-ladylike behavior aboard an actively flying
aircraft.]{.rendered_qtext}
