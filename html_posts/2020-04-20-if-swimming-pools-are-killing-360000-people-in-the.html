**If swimming pools are killing 360,000 people in the United States a
year, why aren\'t they banned? That\'s higher than the American death
toll from WWII.**

A few points as to why these things (and other potentially dangerous, if
misused) things are still legal:

1.  Swimming pools are used safely by millions of people every day. The
    stupidity of a few should not ruin the enjoyment of millions.
2.  You can't legislate good behavior. You can't force parental eyeballs
    to be on their children all the time, and while you can force people
    to fence off attractive nuisances, you'll never be able to stop
    people from entering those areas unlawfully if they choose. People
    even break in to indoor swimming pools, so forcing them to be
    indoors is not a solution either.
