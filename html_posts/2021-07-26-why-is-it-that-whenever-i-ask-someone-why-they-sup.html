I can help you with that.

I support *the idea of Trump*.

- I support a "political outsider." Someone who hasn't been "infected"
  by "the swamp."
- I support someone who will stand up to "the swamp" and to special
  interests alike.
- I support someone who can't be bought (and while I don't like the idea
  of billionaires running the country, billionaires can safely turn down
  big money donors).
- I support someone who, at a very minimum, "talks the talk." They
  understand the plight of the small businessman, whose efforts comprise
  much of the base of the economy. The understand the plight of the blue
  collar worker, who is largely ignored by the coastal elites.
- I support someone who may not necessarily be a true "conservative" in
  every sense of the word, but someone who understands and espouses at
  least a few conservative ideas, like reining in big government and
  empowering the states to address regional issues, and dismantling the
  scourge of bureaucratic despotism.

And while Trump is many of these things, **I don't like Trump the man.**
He is brash. He is bombastic. He is ineloquent. Not that any of these
things are *required* to be President, but as was evidenced by Trump's
presidency, when you have those qualities, your *intent* is often
overlooked while the media and the Democrats pore over your *words*. His
reliance on social media to reach his base was eventually his downfall,
and while it has sparked a conversation about big tech censorship, I
think that his use of the technology instead of increased curated
outreach by a press office was, in fact, a hindrance rather than a
benefit.

He's also a *misogynist.* He's a "womanizer." He may have slowed down
these days, but those behaviors actually alter your brain chemistry and
make you think along specific neural pathways that I abhor. Again, it
seems that everyone in Washington has skeletons (and a lot of other
stuff I could go my whole life without seeing) in their closets, but the
whole Stormy Daniels business just took too much attention away from
what he needed to do.

We *want* to like Trump, because he embodies everything that we like,
politically. But we don't like all of those political things *in the
package that is Trump*.

When it came down to *Trump vs Clinton*, the choice was much easier. But
by himself, Trump carries too much baggage to really be effective in
doing all of the things we want to do.

So it's really hard to directly answer the question about "do you like
Trump" because that implies so many things. I like Trump's ideas, but I
don't like Trump.

Original question:

Why is it that whenever I ask someone why they support Trump, they never
give me a straight answer? The response is always about the other
political parties or some other politician.
