**Content:** [You shouldn\'t have to be responsible for the actions of
another human being. You are not their parent, you are their spouse.\
\
The only way that I would consider taking any responsibility for that
person\'s actions is if I specifically told that person that whatever
activity they were doing was perfectly legal. If I was personally
misinformed about the law, and then I told that person that their action
was legal, I might then feel partially responsible for that person\'s
illegal activities.\
\
You shouldn\'t blame yourself, and you shouldn\'t feel responsible for
the actions of another person. Each person has the ability, and the
responsibility, to act in accordance with the law. Each adult personally
shares the responsibility to understand what the local laws are and to
act accordingly. It\'s part of the social contract, part of the
responsibility we take on when living in a society and a nation of
laws.]{.rendered_qtext}
