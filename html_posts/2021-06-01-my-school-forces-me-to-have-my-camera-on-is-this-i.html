If you attend school from home, and you use Zoom or something similar,
yes the school can require you have your camera on during class time.
You can get in trouble if you don't have your camera on. This is not
illegal. You are required to go to school, and if you attend virtually
instead of in person, the school can require conditions of your
attendance to include having your camera on during instructional time.
