The United States is not a monetary sovereignty. The United States *has*
monetary sovereignty over its currency. It gets to define the currency,
and issue and destroy currency.

If there is a deficit, it may affect the United States\' credit rating
in other countries. In general, though, the United States has run a
deficit for many years, and our credit rating with other countries is
generally fairly stable.
