This is such a good question. I mean, if the resurrection didn't happen,
then the rest of Christianity falls like a house of cards.

The Bible tells us that Jesus was crucified, His body was taken down,
and it was placed in a tomb. Let's take a quick look at the type of tomb
we're talking about here. This was a tomb that only rich men could
afford (the tomb belonged to Joseph of Arimathea, who was admittedly a
rich man). This tomb, hewn into the side of a mountain, was closed with
a round stone which was rolled down a channel and settled into a
V-shaped groove (also cut into the stone) in front of the entrance. The
stone weighed about two tons (4000 pounds). It took about 16--20 men
along with ropes and poles (used as levers) to move the stone, either
into or out of position.

The Sanhedrin was still not satisfied that the disciples wouldn't try to
steal Jesus' body and make it look like a resurrection, so they
(primarily Annas and Caiaphas) went to Pontius Pilate and requested that
the tomb be sealed and that guards be placed outside of the tomb to
prevent anyone messing with it over the prophesied "three days" window.
Pilate agreed to this request. He sent at least one squad of soldiers,
but it was likely at least four squads (16 soldiers). Some accounts say
that there were as many as 30 or 40. Why so many? It was the Passover.
There were hundreds of thousands of pilgrims in town. Many of these were
fans of Jesus. The Romans and the chief priests would have been aware of
this, and they would have posted a quantity of guards proportional to
the perceived threat.

The guards were led by a man named Petronius, who was a Temple Guard,
and upheld the highest standards of Roman soldiers. He knew what
happened to Roman soldiers who fell asleep at their posts. For example,
Temple Guards who were caught sleeping were flogged and their clothes
were set on fire...while they were in them. These troops were
specialized, especially in night watch. They had it down to a science,
with rotating shifts and random patrols to ensure no one was asleep on
the job (upon pain of death).

Additionally, the tomb was *sealed*. This means that, much in the same
way that a scroll was sealed with a wax seal, a very large wax seal was
placed on the tomb, and was imprinted with the seal of the Procurator
himself. Defacing one of these seals was a high crime, and the
punishment was (yes, you guessed it) death. And this was a *Roman*
crime, not a Jewish crime.

\

So that's the background around how Jesus' tomb was closed, sealed, and
guarded. With that understanding, do you think it is possible that 11
men could have snuck in past *all those Roman guards* (who would have
needed to all be asleep at the same time) and, without making enough
noise to wake up the sleeping guards, roll a 4000 pound capstone uphill,
let alone halfway up the mountainside where they found it?

The Bible records that the Roman guards all watched in awe as an angel
unsealed the tomb and casually threw the two-ton stone halfway up the
mountainside. They literally froze in fear (the Bible says they became
"like dead men").

So what were they to do? Do they say someone broke the seal? If they
don't identify who broke the seal, *they* take the punishment (which is
death). Do they say *they* broke the seal (a crime punishable by death)?
Do they say they all simultaneously fell asleep (also, a crime
punishable by death)? In a panic, and faced with a litany of bad
options, they do the smartest thing they can possibly do and rush to the
chief priests in the Sanhedrin **and tell them everything.**

The chief priests gave them large sums of money and told them to make up
a story, to say that the disciples broke into the tomb and stole the
body. Incidentally, "bearing false witness" was also a crime punishable
by death. Nevertheless, faced with a list of bad scenarios which would
only lead to a bad outcome, the Roman guards took the money and spread
the story that the disciples broke into the tomb and stole the body.

\

To make matters worse, Jesus appeared to over 500 people in the thirty
days He walked the earth following His resurrection. These people
testified to seeing Jesus alive. They were executed for their testimony,
and they continued to claim, up until the moment they were executed,
that they actually saw Jesus alive. Now, while people may die for a lie
they *think* is the truth, no one in their right mind would die for what
they *know* is a lie, let alone over 500 people. So it's unlikely that
these people would have made up the story of Jesus' resurrection, only
to be killed for it, when all they would have to do would be to renounce
the story, and they would live. Instead, they proclaimed that Jesus was
alive until they were executed.

If the apostles were lying, why didn't the chief priests just produce
the body and shut the whole thing down right then and there? But no one
could ever find the body. All the Romans would have to do to completely
eradicate Christianity in its nascent tracks would be to find the body
and parade it around the streets of Jerusalem to prove that Jesus was
still dead. But they never did.

And if the apostles were making up the story, why would they start
proclaiming Jesus' resurrection *in Jerusalem*, where it would be the
easiest to disprove the story, where everyone knew what happened? Why
wouldn't they go far away to tell their tale, where it couldn't be so
easily disproven?

While they were loudly proclaiming what they saw, all of Jesus'
opposition, all the Sanhedrin, just stood there and didn't dispute any
of it. Why? Why were they so silent in the face of this testimony of the
risen Christ? The fact that they never tried to disprove what the
apostles were saying speaks to the truth that they probably could not.

\

Given everything we have reviewed, the most likely scenario is that
Jesus actually rose from the dead. Of course, this is only looking at
the time of Jesus' death and resurrection. The entire Bible points to
this one moment with foreshadowings and prophesies which prove what
Jesus was claiming. But we're just looking at this one incident and how
likely it is that it happened in the way that the disciples and
eyewitnesses claimed it happened.
