Benign MS is not a form of MS. It is a term used to describe
**Relapsing-Remitting MS** (RRMS) with periods of relapse characterized
by very mild symptoms, and extended periods of remission (in the span of
years).

You can really only say that you have benign MS if you've gone at least
15 years with no symptoms, and you have little to no disability related
to MS.

**Benign MS does not mean that you do not have MS**. This simply means
that your *symptoms* are mild to non-existent. MRIs still show disease
progress, even if the progress does not produce symptoms. Additionally,
benign MS can become active at any time.

Most neurologists shy away from this term because it only describes
*past experience,* not future potential. And it confers a false sense of
security which may lead patients to forego needed treatment.
