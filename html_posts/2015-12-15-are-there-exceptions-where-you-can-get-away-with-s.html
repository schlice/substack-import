In the letter of the law, the only allowances for violation of vehicle
and traffic laws are for emergency vehicles, which are designated
vehicles used by government agencies or affiliates, with appropriate
warning equipment attached (i.e. lights and siren).

Ideally, you should take [[Christopher
Hawk](https://www.quora.com/profile/Christopher-Hawk)]{.qlink_container}\'s
advice and call an ambulance. Not only can they get you to the hospital
quicker and more safely than you can do yourself, if they need to treat
the patient en route, they can do so, which you, apportioned in your car
for *passengers* and not *patients*, cannot.
