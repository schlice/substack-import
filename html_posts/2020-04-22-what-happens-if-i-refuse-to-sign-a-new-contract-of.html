**What happens if I refuse to sign a new contract of employment?**

If the position is a contract-only position, this is definitely the most
important document to sign, as it defines the contract under which you
will be employed. This is a "must-sign" document. Failing to sign the
document can lead to your termination if you refuse. But usually,
they'll try to work with you by finding out why you won't sign. Perhaps
there is a misunderstanding about the contract that some simple
communication could clear up. Perhaps there are some changes the
employee wants to make that would be acceptable to the business. There
are indeed many things that could be the cause of the employee not
signing, and the employer will try to consider them before initiating
termination proceedings.

Other specific documents have other remedies if employees refuse to
sign. For example, not signing the employee handbook has a different set
of remedies, as does not signing a disciplinary memo or a performance
report.
