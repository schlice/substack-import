No, that's a cultural norm, not a Biblical command. The Bible says that
sex is to only take place between a married man and the wife to whom he
is married. The sex outside of marriage was already a sin, so we're
already well past following God's rules on this one.

A man marrying the woman he's knocked up is a man taking responsibility
for his actions, and committing to raise the child in a common household
with the child's mother. Despite the current society's elevation and
laudation of single motherhood, the statistics do not lie: children have
***the best possible chance for a good outcome in life*** when they are
raised by their biological parents in a common
household.[\[1\]](#HarIJ){#cite-HarIJ
.citation_link}[\[2\]](#rqeYd){#cite-rqeYd .citation_link}

This well-known-but-not-frequently-discussed statistic morphed into a
societal norm, which is often expressed in polite company this way:

*Well, are you going to do the right thing and marry her?*

"Doing the right thing" means owning up to your mistakes (and the
implication here is that impregnating a girl outside of marriage is a
mistake, even without the religious context) and doing what's *best* for
the woman and the baby. The idea is that in the traditional context of
"being a man," fixing your own mistakes is at the top of the list.
