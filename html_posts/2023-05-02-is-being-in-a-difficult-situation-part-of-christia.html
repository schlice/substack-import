They are not part and parcel of Christianity (in other words, belief in
Christ does not cause them), but we are indeed told that we should
expect them to come:

> "I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In
> this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the
> world." --- John 16:33 NIV

Note that Christ doesn't say "in this world you *might occasionally*
have trouble." He doesn't say "in this world you *could* have trouble."
He says, "In this world you **will** have trouble." In other words, we
should **expect** trouble.

Paul wrote:

> In all our troubles my joy knows no bounds. For when we came into
> Macedonia, this body of ours had no rest, but we were harassed at
> every turn---conflicts on the outside, fears within ---2 Cor. 7:4-5

Peter wrote:

> Dear friends, do not be surprised at the painful trial you are
> suffering, as though something strange were happening to you. But
> rejoice that you participate in the sufferings of Christ, so that you
> may be overjoyed when His glory is revealed ---1 Pet. 4:12-13.

The important point to note from these references is **the coexistence
of both joy and pain.** This is the consistent, unequivocal expectation
we have been given by the biblical writers, and yet we don't want to
accept that joy and pain will both come to believers.

But, as the question seemingly asks, does this mean we as Christians are
*destined* to be depressed and victimized by the circumstances of our
lives? Certainly not. Paul said we are "more than conquerors." He wrote:

> Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice! Let your
> gentleness be evident to all. The Lord is near. Do not be anxious
> about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with
> thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God,
> which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds
> in Christ Jesus. --- Philippians 4:4-7

Clearly, what we have found here in Scripture is a paradox: this
coexistence of **joy** and **pain.** On the one hand we are told to
expect suffering and hardship that could even cost us our lives. On the
other hand, we are encouraged to be thankful and joyful. How can we
rejoice and be under intense pressure at the same time? How can we be
secure when surrounded by insecurity?

That is a mystery, which, according to Paul, "transcends all
understanding." But we are to expect confusing experiences to occur, and
to not be dismayed when they arrive. Welcome them as opportunities for
your faith to grow. "Lean into the pain" when your time to suffer comes
around (and don't forget, we should expect those times of suffering to
occur). Never give in to feelings of self-pity or victimization, which
you can be certain that Satan will use against us, as they are some of
his most effective tools. Instead, store away your questions for a
lengthy conversation in eternity, and then keep moving forward.

TL;DR: We should expect trouble to occur, but we should trust in the
Lord and "lean not on our own understanding."
