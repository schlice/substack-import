**As gun owners, why do you believe \"An armed society is a polite
society\"?**

This answer comes from a post called "[[Why the gun is
civilization](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b4201b&url=https://munchkinwrangler.wordpress.com/2007/03/23/why-the-gun-is-civilization/){.external_link

Let me pull out a few quotes from that piece:

**People who argue for the banning of arms ask for automatic rule by the
young, the strong, and the many, and that's the exact opposite of a
civilized society.**

**A mugger, even an armed one, can only make a successful living in a
society where the state has granted him a force monopoly.**

**The gun at my side means that I cannot be forced, only persuaded.
\[...\] It doesn't limit the actions of those who would interact with me
through reason, only the actions of those who would do so by force. It
removes force from the equation.**

**\[A\]nd that's why carrying a gun is a civilized act.**
