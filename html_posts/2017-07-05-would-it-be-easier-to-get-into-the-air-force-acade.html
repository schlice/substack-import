To be honest with you, I can't see how that would be "easier."

Think about what you're saying. You enlist in the Air Force, attend
Basic Training in Lackland, go to Tech School, serve three years as an
enlisted member so that you can show that you have what it takes to be
an Air Force officer so that you can be recommended by your chain of
command so that you can attend the Prep School so that you can enter the
Academy and take Basic Training all over again.

That doesn't sound very "easy" to me.
