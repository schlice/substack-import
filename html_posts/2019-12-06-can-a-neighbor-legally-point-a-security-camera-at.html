**Can a neighbor legally point a security camera at my property, land,
garage or home? If so, how can I stop it?**

*(US Answer Only)*

In the vast majority of cases, yes.

In general, if he can see it from his property, he can point a camera at
it. It's no different than if he stood at that point on his property and
looked at yours. Unfortunately, the security camera which can see into
your property can also be used for legitimate security purposes. Unless
he has it mounted to the fence and it *only* sees in your yard, he can
use it in his yard for lawful surveillance of his own property, even if
it *incidentally* captures your own yard.

In most jurisdictions, as far as looking *into* your home is concerned,
if his camera is in a lawful location on his own property, you need to
ensure that you are exercising your right to privacy inside your home by
drawing the blinds. Some jurisdictions *may* consider that a "peeping
Tom" violation, but most do not.

How can you stop it?

- Plant tall trees
- Install an infrared spotlight on the side of your house or garage
  pointing into his. It won't be visible to anyone but the camera, and
  it will blind the camera from seeing anything in your yard.

Or the most radical solution of all:

- Talk to your neighbor. Tell him that you don't mind that he's using a
  security camera, but you're concerned that it is looking into your
  yard. You are well aware that it's not technically illegal, but maybe
  he could find another vantage point to mount his camera that still
  accomplished his security needs without needlessly incidentally
  viewing your property.
