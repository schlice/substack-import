There is no correct or incorrect way. There are only approved methods in
your jurisdiction for filing a lawsuit.

And in order to do so ***and ensure your best chance for success***, you
should get an attorney.

If I could say that there was a "correct" way to file a lawsuit, that
would be it. Get an attorney.

If you wish to sue the apartment complex in small claims court, the
respondent would simply be the complex, care of the management agency
(if there is one), and the business address of the business office on
record for the complex. Check with your local municipal court on how to
file in your small-claims court.
