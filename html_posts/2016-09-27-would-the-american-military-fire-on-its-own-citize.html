Martial law is a unique situation. It usually occurs when law and order
has broken down to such a degree that the military needs to take control
of the government. Many rights we enjoy as Americans would be suspended,
such as *habeas corpus.* Usually, most civil rights and civil laws are
suspended and are replaced with military law, in this case the UCMJ, and
all citizens become subject to it, not just the military. When military
members find civilians in violation of UCMJ, they are arrested and
brought before a military tribunal.

So the reason behind the declaration of martial law will really
determine how the military responds. For example, let's say Trump wins
the election, and the Democrats get together and stage a *coup d'etat*
and attempt to take over Washington. Occupy Democrats get together with
Black Lives Matter (not too much of a stretch there) and do the same in
state government. The government could declare martial law and allow the
military to take over. Theoretically, they could detain anyone who was
found to be a Democrat and put them in internment camps so that we could
restore law and order. Military members would likely follow those
orders.

Martial law usually isn't declared for natural disasters; that's usually
a state of emergency. Let's say we had a state of emergency and military
members were told to round up all Democrats, I think you'd find whole
battalions of soldiers refusing those orders *en masse.*

So whether or not military members would consciously object to the
orders would depend on the reason that martial law was imposed in the
first place.
