**Is it fraud if I give you consent to sign for me?**

As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."

Depending on the document you intend to grant someone else permission to
sign on your behalf, there may be a legal process you must go through in
order to grant that permission. In most cases, you'll need to use this
procedure in order to have someone else legally sign for you; most
reputable businesses won't accept someone else's signature in your
behalf without this procedure being followed.

You will need to produce a special document. It's called a "Special
Power of Attorney." It's a document that you sign and notarize that
allows someone else to sign a document as you. It basically says that
you grant so-and-so permission to sign as you on the following
documents, and then you list the documents. The power is limited to the
documents you specify; the person can't take that document and then go
buy a car in your name using your credit (unless that's the document you
are allowing them to sign).

The signer then takes your notarized power of attorney and signs the
document "Jane Doe, attorney-in-fact for John Doe" and a copy of the PoA
must be attached to the document.

Then, and only then, can you and the signer not be accused of fraud.
