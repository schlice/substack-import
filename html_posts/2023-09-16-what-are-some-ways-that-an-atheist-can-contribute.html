- Be a good human. Treat everyone with respect, despite the fact that
  some of those religious people wrongly don't treat you with respect.
  It is a sad fact of modern religious practice that many religious
  people overlook the person and see the sin (remember, they see atheism
  as a sin).
- Along those same lines, don't denigrate the whole because of the
  actions of a few. Those few will definitely sour you to the whole
  group of theists as a whole. The religion itself is not to blame;
  people's understanding of the religion is what causes that distaste.
  And I can understand it: even being a religious person, I see their
  actions and it is disappointing to me too.
- Don't get frustrated when the religious try to convert you. They will,
  but they are quite ham-handed about the whole thing, because most of
  them have never had any formalized training on evangelism. They do
  what they think is right without any knowledge, so please be patient
  with them. Their intentions are noble even if their actions
  are...questionable.
- Along the same "be a good human" lines, participate when you can. If
  there are volunteer efforts ongoing (run by the religious), volunteer
  if you can. You don't have to be religious to demonstrate what it
  means to be a good person.
