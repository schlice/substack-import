**If someone knowingly gives a gun to a criminal, are they accessories
to subsequent crimes committed with the gun?**

In general, no.

In order to connect the dots back to the person who gave the gun to the
criminal, the giver must have specific knowledge that 1. the criminal
was not legally authorized to possess the gun, and 2. the criminal was
going to use the illegally obtained gun to commit a specific crime. This
is a very tough bar to overcome, and it generally does not occur unless
the giver is actually criminally complicit in the crime (i.e. the giver,
who is legally authorized to buy a gun, is actually a criminal and is
part of the plot to commit the crime).

But in that case, the giver is likely an accessory to the actual crime.

At worst, generally the giver would only be guilty of violating gun laws
(i.e. knowingly transferring a gun to someone who is not legally
authorized to possess one). As an example, the person who sold the guns
to Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris (the Columbine High School shooters),
Mark Manes, was sentenced to six years in prison for providing a handgun
to a minor. The man who introduced Klebold and Harris to Manes, Philip
Duran, was sentenced to four and a half years for his part in
transacting the deal. Neither Manes nor Duran were found guilty of
killing anyone, or contributing to their death. Their crimes were
related only to gun laws.
