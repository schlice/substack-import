**Did you believe Trump was so concerned about our welfare that he
called off the convention all on his own? Or did Jacksonville try to
impose some logical restrictions?**

Neither.

Trump's advisers told him that it would be best for his image if he
cancelled the convention. If they would have let him, he'd have plowed
on ahead with the convention. But it would have been terrible optics to
hold the convention in a state experiencing a "spike" like Florida is.
