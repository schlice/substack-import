**Is there a legal remedy when congress fails to take action against
improper presidential actions?**

Absolutely.

It is perfectly legal to not vote for the offending politicians in the
next election.

This is the "legal remedy" built into our system of government. When the
elected representatives of the people fail to adequately represent the
people, the people retain the right to not vote for them again, and they
peacefully leave office. They don't get to stay in power forever. They
only get to stay in power as long as the people continue to vote for
them.
