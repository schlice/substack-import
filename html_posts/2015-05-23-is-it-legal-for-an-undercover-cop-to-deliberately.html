**Content:** [I have seen police cars ride with fire trucks with their
lights and siren on and I have watched them pull drivers over for
failing to yield to emergency vehicles. This had been an issue here a
few years back. It became less of an issue when the police started
cracking down on it.\
\
And in your hypothetical, it would not be entrapment. The officer is not
offering for someone to break the law. They merely set the conditions
for someone to break the law. They neither encourage nor suggest that
someone should break the law, so entrapment does not
apply.]{.rendered_qtext}
