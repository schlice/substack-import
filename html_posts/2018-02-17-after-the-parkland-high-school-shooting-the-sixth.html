**After the Parkland High School shooting (the sixth school shooting of
the year), how can Second Amendment advocates continue to claim that
senseless shootings like these are the price of the freedom to own
firearms?**

You phrased your question incorrectly. Instead of saying "senseless
shootings," say "senseless murder using a gun."

When you say it that way, you emphasize that it is the **murder** that
is senseless, not the use of the gun.

Do you realize that more teens died in teen-related car accidents than
in school shootings on February 15th? We rightly call those "senseless
deaths using a car" but we don't call for bans on teen driving.

Terrorists used a pressure cooker to create a bomb and kill people at
the Boston Marathon. We rightly call that "senseless murder using a
pressure cooker" but you don't see any calls to regulate pressure
cookers.

Terrorists used rental trucks to mow down large crowds of people. We
rightly call those "senseless murder using a rental truck," but you
don't see any calls to limit civilian usage of rental trucks.

It is a given that Constitutionally-protected, easy access to firearms
will allow someone to use that tool to commit murder, just as easy
access to rental trucks allows terrorists to rent one and mow down a
crowd of pedestrians, or easy access to pressure cookers allows
terrorists to get one and build a bomb.

The common thread is **murder**. The tool is ancillary.

So **yes, the fact that we have relatively easy access to firearms means
that murderers can use those tools to commit murders.** ***Taking the
tool away will not stop the murder. It will just modify the choice of
tool.***
