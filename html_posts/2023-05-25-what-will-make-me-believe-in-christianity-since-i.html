Nothing.

Nothing can ***make*** you believe anything. No one on earth can make
you do anything against your will, and God chooses to not make you
believe anything against your will.

Sometimes, people can bend your will, in violation of your free choices,
through coercion (i.e. torture, deprivation, etc), but in most cases, no
one can make you believe or do anything if you do not choose to do it
first.

**The only person who can make you believe in the truth of Christianity
is you.**

So now, it's up to you to discover the truth. How? Humbly seeking
answers, asking God to show you the truth of the Gospel.

***Because only God has the power to change your heart.***

> For I know the plans I have for you," declares the Lord, "plans to
> prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.
> Then you will call on me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to
> you. You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your
> heart." --- Jeremiah 29:11--13 NIV
>
> I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove
> from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. ---
> Ezekiel 36:26 NIV

When you seek Him with all of your heart, you will find Him, and he will
transform you, giving you a "heart of flesh" that is capable of loving
Him. Only He can do this (in fact, it's a process we call
*regeneration*). When you had your "heart of stone," you could not love
Him. You were *dead* in your transgressions:

> As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins, in which
> you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the
> ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in
> those who are disobedient. All of us also lived among them at one
> time, gratifying the cravings of our flesh and following its desires
> and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature deserving of wrath. But
> because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us
> alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions---it is by
> grace you have been saved. --- Ephesians 2:1--5 NIV

**He regenerates you through His grace**. Jesus echoed Yahweh's words:

> "Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and
> the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; the
> one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be
> opened.
>
> "Which of you, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Or

Jesus says the same: seek Him and you will find Him, because if you
seek, you will find. Jesus also cautions that few will choose this path,
for "wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction,
and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road
that leads to life, and only a few find it." So the small gate and
narrow path exist, but you have to put in the work to find them. But if
you do, God promises that you will indeed find Him.
