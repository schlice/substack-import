**Content:** [Our local police departments in the United States are akin
to paramilitary organizations. Paramilitary organizations tend to have
similar (if less detailed) rank structures (usually officers, troopers
or deputies, sergeants, lieutenants, captains or bureau chiefs, deputy
chief or undersheriff, and chief of police or sheriff, but those can
differ by department). They hold many of the same ideals but are much
closer to home.\
\
The Sheriff\'s Department feels like much more of a family than the
military ever did. Granted, military families were close because of
their shared experiences and ideals, but the actual working organization
of our Sheriff\'s Department is much closer than our actual working
organization in the military. The strict anti-fraternization rules make
that \"family\" feeling something that is vilified in the active-duty
military. The police are always in the front lines of the local
community and always being scrutinized for every decision they make.
This shared experience brings them closer together than the military,
which is highly insulated by many layers of bureaucracy.\
\
(EDIT: seems I didn\'t finish answering the question). Regardless of my
past military experience, I was re-trained in the Sheriff\'s Department.
All peace officers are required to receive the same training, as is
required by state law. Testing and training are a big part of what we
do, ensuring our skills are honed and meet minimum standards. The basic
military foundation was great to have in the department, and I think it
made the training regimen that much easier for me. Military etiquette is
always appreciated in the department, but is far less formalized than in
the military. This also contributes to the greater \"family\" feel. I
still highly respect my superior officers in the department, even though
I am not required to salute like I was in the
military.]{.rendered_qtext}
