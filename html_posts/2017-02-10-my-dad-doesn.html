Short answer: no.

Longer answer: While you don't have to speak English to drive a car, or
get a license, you still have to follow the law regarding DUI. The
native language of the person driving the car doesn't change his or her
blood alcohol content, and there is no provision in the driving laws of
any state that I know of which would require that the driver fully
understand exactly what the officers were doing in order for them to do
their jobs.

Officers can suspect a driver of DUI (they did), stop that driver (they
did), and perform field sobriety tests for DUI (and clearly, he
understood enough to perform the field sobriety test or to blow into a
BAC tester), which are required of every driver, regardless of native
language.

Therefore, whether or not the driver had a clear understanding of the
officers is not material. Unless you're claiming that he wasn't actually
drunk, he just failed his field sobriety test because he didn't
understand what the officers were asking him. This is highly unlikely,
but perhaps that is the case you can make.

I suspect, however, that the officers stopped the car which was being
operated in a manner which suggested the driver may be drunk, there was
a strong odor of alcohol from the driver, and the driver blew a XXX on
the meter, which is X times over the legal limit. If the police have
this sort of evidence, language is irrelevant.
