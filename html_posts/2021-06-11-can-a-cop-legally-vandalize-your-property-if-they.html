This is a tough question to answer, because when the police are done
with a search warrant, they are under no obligation to put anything back
that they tore apart. So it sure looks like someone vandalized your
property.

But where they look and how much they tear apart is dependent on what
they are looking for.

For example, if they are looking for something the size of a 65″ TV,
they won't ransack your dresser drawers, because you can't fit a 65″ TV
in a dresser drawer. They can't break open a table lamp to search for a
TV. But if they're looking for something the size of, say, a ring box or
a thumb drive, they can go through *everything*. And like I said, they
don't have to put anything back the way they found it when they're done.
They can dump the contents of all of your dresser drawers on to the
floor to search, and they don't have to fold your clothes and put them
away when they are concluded with their search. If anything breaks while
they are executing the search, they will not fix it; you will usually
have to pursue legal action to get the item's cost reimbursed.

And if, for example, they find a locked room, they should give you the
option to open it before they break down the door.

Ultimately. their actions must be *reasonable*. They can't intentionally
destroy *everything* while they're looking for *something*.

So in a way, yes, a cop can legally vandalize your property if they have
a warrant to search your house, but it's more nuanced than that.
