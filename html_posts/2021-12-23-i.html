I don't understand this "supposedly know nothing" statement you've made.

Are you saying that before Jesus came, no one had any knowledge of God?
Because the Bible doesn't agree.

> For when Gentiles who do not have the Law do instinctively the things
> of the Law, these, not having the Law, are a law to themselves, in
> that they show the work of the Law written in their hearts, their
> conscience bearing witness and their thoughts alternately accusing or
> else defending them --- Romans 2:14--15 NASB1995

This passage talks about the fact that some people, even though they
have never heard the Gospel, still live as if they have. They do this
because "the work of the Law \[is\] written in their hearts" and "their
conscience...alternately accusing or else defending them."

God has written his truth in our hearts. This is backed up by studies
which show that young children know right from wrong without ever having
been taught it. We have an innate sense of fairness and justice and
morality. That's not by accident; God wrote it on our hearts. In this
way, no one can claim ignorance.

Original question:

I\'m a born again Christian but the state of the dead, how they
supposedly know nothing, I find disturbing. Why\'s this?
