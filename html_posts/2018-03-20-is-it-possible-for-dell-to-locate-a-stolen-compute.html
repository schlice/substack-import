**Is it possible for Dell to locate a stolen computer if you have the
serial number/ service tag number by pinging it on the internet
somehow?**

Sorry to hear about the laptop, but the short answer is no.

Unless you installed a specific anti-theft application (like [[LoJack
for
Laptops](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=40097c&url=https://www.dell.com/content/topics/segtopic.aspx/lojack?c%3Dus%26cs%3D19%26l%3Den%26s%3Ddhs){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"

Dell cannot directly trace your laptop through the Service Tag or Serial
Number.

You should first notify the police that your laptop was stolen, then use
[[this

rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="dell.com"}]{.qlink_container} to notify Dell that your
laptop was stolen. This way, Dell can work with law enforcement when
they contact Dell for information regarding your laptop.
