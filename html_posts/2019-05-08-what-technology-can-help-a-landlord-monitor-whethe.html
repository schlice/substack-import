**What technology can help a landlord monitor whether a tenant is
illegally renting out his or her place as an Airbnb?**

As with all questions which drift towards the legal, the answer is "it
depends."

Landlords, in general, have broad authority to manage their property.
They can go so far as to install cameras in the common areas of the
property to monitor activities in that space, and this is perfectly
legal.

Many landlords partner with service companies to turn their properties
into "smart properties." This has advantages for both the landlords and
the tenants. The landlords can monitor things like power usage,
utilities, and security, while tenants receive smart home benefits, like
keyless entry, smart thermostats, and those same security cameras to
check on your dog while you're at work.

One such service company is
[[SmartRent](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=13a36c&url=https://smartrent.com/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="smartrent.com"}]{.qlink_container}, but there are others
like
[[Stratis](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d5fd73&url=https://stratisiot.com){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="stratisiot.com"}]{.qlink_container},
[[Zego](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=526981&url=https://www.zego.io/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="zego.io"}]{.qlink_container}, and
[[Vivint](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=785e80&url=https://www.vivint.com/smart-properties){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="vivint.com"}]{.qlink_container}.

Finally, the best way a landlord can monitor whether or not a tenant is
illegally renting out his place as an Airbnb is...Airbnb. You can very
simply search Airbnb listings for your apartment. If you're going to
list a place on Airbnb as an illegal rental, potential tenants, as well
as the landlord, can find that listing.
