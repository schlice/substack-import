**Is the United States committing terrorism by taking children from
their families with no plan for reuniting them?**

Nope. The United States is enforcing the laws as written by Congress.
Terrorism is a lawless act by its very nature, so the United States is
certainly not engaging in terrorism. The goal of separating parents from
their children is not to incite terror or fear, so again, the US is not
engaging in terrorism.

That's an example of *media sensationalism.* It certainly caught your
eye, didn't it? Ha, gotcha.

The law is very clear: illegal immigrant children (accompanied by their
parents or not) cannot be incarcerated for more than 20 days. If their
illegal immigrant parents are going to be incarcerated for more than 20
days, the law is clear: the children must be transferred.

People also fail to remember that *within this country, each and every
day, children are taken from their parents*. This happens to American
citizens! Every day! Parents who are arrested have their children taken
away each and every day in America, and in far greater numbers than what
is happening at the border.

But the one thing in common between American citizens and illegal
immigrants who have lost custody of their children: **they all broke the
law**. They all ended up in jail, and your kids can't stay with you in
jail.

So until we establish "family jails" where the whole family can stay
together in jail, we have no choice but to remove those children.
