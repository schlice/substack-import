There is a difference between "church shopping" and "finding a church
which matches your values," or at the very least, "finding a church
which espouses Biblical values."

Some people do indeed confuse "God doesn't care what you wear" with "God
still expects you to have a modicum of propriety." If your manner of
dress causes you to sin, then it is clearly, unequivocally wrong. But it
is *just as wrong* if your manner of dress causes *someone else* to sin.

Paul talked about this to the new believers in Corinth. And while he
didn't address clothing (it wasn't a terribly big problem at that time),
he addressed **food.**

Food was a major issue of Christian liberty in the Corinthian church;
specifically, "food offered to idols" (1 Corinthians 8:1). All the
Corinthian Christians (except perhaps the Jewish ones) would have had
backgrounds in pagan idol worship. When they became Christians, they
renounced these idols and all the expressions of worship associated with
them.

The problem was that idol worship was woven into the very fabric of
Corinthian civic, trade, and social life---it was culturally pervasive.
Idol temples were social centers, and could function similarly to public
restaurants (1 Corinthians 8:10). And much of the meat sold in the
markets and served in homes had been ritually offered to idols (1
Corinthians 10:25, 27). That meant eating meat could be interpreted as
an act of idolatry, a betrayal of Christian beliefs (1 Corinthians
8:10).

Wonderfully, however, some Corinthian Christians were discovering that
"an idol has no real existence, and that there is no God but one" (1
Corinthians 8:4). Since idols were no real things, they realized that
meat sacrificed to idols was meat sacrificed to nothing (1 Corinthians
10:19--20). Therefore, eating meat sacrificed to idols could not be
idolatry if the people eating knew that idols weren't real. They were
free to eat this meat with a clear conscience! Paul agreed with them (1
Corinthians 10:26, 29).

Paul did not agree, however, with how some of them were exercising this
newfound Christian freedom. In effect, some of the Corinthians had
placed a higher value on enjoying this freedom than on the spiritual
good of other souls. First, not all the Corinthian Christians "possessed
this knowledge" (1 Corinthians 8:7). Some of them, perhaps newer
converts or those who, for whatever reason, had tender consciences,
still felt like eating meat sacrificed to an idol was a form of
idolatrous worship. For them, to eat sacrificial meat was to deny
Christ.

Second, others, who may have even believed idols were nonentities, would
face temptation to a different kind of idolatry by eating such meat.
Many Corinthian converts likely paid a high price to become Christians.
Renouncing the false pagan religion(s) meant renouncing social customs,
family traditions, and friendship networks. Some, no doubt, lost their
jobs. You can imagine the temptation some experienced to give at least
an appearance of homage to the prevailing religion in order to avoid
losing employment, social status, and family disapproval.

Third, there was the issue of gospel witness among non-Christians who
were watching the Christians. What would pagans think of Christians who
knowingly ate meat sacrificed to idols? They would likely assume that
the Christians venerated the idols just like they did, and therefore
there was no real reason to give heed to Christians' odd claims. And
what would Jews think of this behavior? That Christians were pagans and
that Christianity was demonic.

So, Paul strongly reminded the Corinthians that far more was at stake
than enjoying sacrificial steaks. **If Christians whose consciences were
free to eat meat sacrificed to idols weren't very careful, the exercise
of their freedom could destroy the faith of another Christian (1
Corinthians 8:9--11) or ruin Jesus's reputation among non-Christians (1
Corinthians 10:27--29).** This is why Paul said, "If food makes my
brother stumble, I will never eat meat, lest I make my brother stumble"
(1 Corinthians 8:13). And then he went on to describe throughout chapter
9 many ways he voluntarily abstained from things he was free to enjoy as
a Christian (not to mention an apostle) like various kinds of food and
drink, marriage, and a full-time ministry salary (1 Corinthians 9:4--7).

The same is true for clothing. If Christians whose consciences were free
to wear whatever clothes they chose weren't careful, the exercise of
their freedom could harm the faith of another Christian, or damage
Jesus' reputation among non-Christians. You can see just how easily that
would be true for someone who lacks propriety and wears revealing
clothing. They may be free to do it, but Paul says that if him doing it
"causes his brother to stumble," then he won't do it.

Sorry for the long-winded answer, but I'm just telling you that it's
okay to find another church which more closely respects the Bible, with
people who more carefully consider the feelings of others, not just
themselves.
