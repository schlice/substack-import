There are many reasons someone may choose to not be vaccinated. And it's
not all about hyper-partisanship like the government is trying to make
you believe.

Remember: the government politicized the virus, the government
politicized the vaccine, and now for the trifecta of abuse, the
government is doing everything in its power to force people to get the
vaccine against their will.

Anyway, the issue is not one of a lack of information, although that
factors in to it. The issue is primarily a ***lack of trust in the
government***.

The government has done an outstanding job at undermining trust in
public health, and people are rightly skeptical about what our "public
health experts" are telling us.

It's no surprise that Biden was unable to meet his goal of having 70% of
the country vaccinated by the 4th of July. When the vaccines were
initially rolled out in December of 2020, 40% of Americans said they
were skeptical about them. Their doubling down and shaming those who
chose to bypass the jab as "morons" or "ignorant" has also backfired,
and has actually reinforced the position that the holdouts already held.

Nevertheless, there are some people who *should* be getting the vaccine
who are not. But the root cause of their reluctance isn't ignorance or
conspiracy theories, or Trump. [[A study done by
MIT](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7c4325&url=https://news.mit.edu/2021/when-more-covid-data-doesnt-equal-more-understanding-0304){.external_link

portion of public health skepticism was "highly informed, scientifically
literate, and sophisticated in the use of data." Skeptics used **the
same data sets** as those with the orthodox views on public health.

From the MIT study:

In other words, because the skeptics are using the same data sets,
vaccine skepticism becomes logical and rational.

This is why vaccine choice is so important. Why treat someone in South
Dakota the same way you treat someone in Manhattan?

We need a better way to think about skepticism towards the vaccines if
we are to move forward and get everyone who needs the vaccine to take
it. We have to be able to allow for people's legitimate concerns. And if
people are doing their own risk-benefit calculations (as the MIT study
found), it would help tremendously if we would not be condescending
toward those who have serious, legitimate questions.

Original question:

In the US, there are still too many Americans, for whatever reason,
aren\'t willing to get vaccinated against COVID, and now cases are on
the rise again. Why do so many people refuse, especially when those who
are suffering, are mostly unvaccinated?

*Sorry, had to disable comments.*

*You see the last line of my answer? The one where I said that it would
help tremendously if we would not be so condescending toward those who
have serious, legitimate concerns? Yeah, as you can see, those are the
people trying to fill my comment section with* ***exactly that type of
sickening condescension. YOU are the reason why the government's
politicizing of the virus and the vaccine is never going to get
better.***

Let's get this straight: **YOUR OPINION about whether or not their
concern is legitimate is COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT. They are as entitled to
their opinion as you are.**

*Thank you for demonstrating the* ***exact behavior*** *we must seek to
avoid.*
