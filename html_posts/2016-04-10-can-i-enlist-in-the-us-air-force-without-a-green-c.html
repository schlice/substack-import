Short answer: Talk to an Air Force recruiter near you.

Longer answer: Yes, you are correct, the Air Force does make exceptions
for persons like yourself who are on a path to citizenship or permanent
residence in the United States. Because you are married to an American,
you are on a path to citizenship. Depending on the needs of the Air
Force, your language skills may make up the difference. Go down to your
local recruiting office and talk to the good folks working there. They
will be happy to guide you through the process.
