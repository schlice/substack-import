**Content:** [Yes, I think they should. Marriage should be an
aggravating factor in rape.\
\
A man who can actually commit the crime of rape against his spouse has a
level of moral turpitude not shared by the garden variety rapist, who is
driven by control and power, as well as the requisite warped view of the
value of the female of the species. Marital rape involves, from what I
know about it, a level of hatred not normally seen in anonymous rape.
There is a cold callousness there which is not even a factor in run of
the mill rape.\
\
I think marital rape should carry a higher penalty. Calling marriage an
aggravating factor would do just that.]{.rendered_qtext}
