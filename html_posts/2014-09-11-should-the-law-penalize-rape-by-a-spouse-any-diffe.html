<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Yes, I think they should. Marriage should be an<br>aggravating factor in rape.\<br>\<br>A man who can actually commit the crime of rape against his spouse has a<br>level of moral turpitude not shared by the garden variety rapist, who is<br>driven by control and power, as well as the requisite warped view of the<br>value of the female of the species. Marital rape involves, from what I<br>know about it, a level of hatred not normally seen in anonymous rape.<br>There is a cold callousness there which is not even a factor in run of<br>the mill rape.\<br>\<br>I think marital rape should carry a higher penalty. Calling marriage an<br>aggravating factor would do just that.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
