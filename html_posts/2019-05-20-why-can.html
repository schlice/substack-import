**Why can\'t Roe v. Wade protect people on a state-wide level?**

This is a great question. I think you're wondering why states are
passing laws making abortion illegal.

Today, they can't do this, and they know it.

What they are doing is creating a challenge to *Roe v. Wade*, the
landmark court decision in 1973 which made abortion legal as a protected
right.

To be clear, I'm not debating the merits or drawbacks of abortion in
this thread. Don't be surprised that if you post a comment about
"abortion is murder" or "you don't respect women" that your comment gets
deleted. This is a legal, Constitutional thread. Want to discuss
abortion? Do it in another thread.

Also, to be fair, *Roe* is a very weak decision, Constitutionally. The
basis for *Roe* was a case called [[*Griswold v.
Connecticut*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=322921&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griswold_v._Connecticut){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}, which found that the
Constitution actually contains a right to privacy, when the words "right
to privacy" do not exist in the Constitution. They used a very
Constitutionally-progressive theory that the "emanations and penumbras"
of the Constitution showed that there is a right to privacy, even though
one isn't written. I can go into Constitutional Progressivism if you're
interested, and how it works, but suffice it to say that there is no
right to privacy written in the Constitution; however, SCOTUS found one.

Once *Griswold* was decided (which was another women's rights case,
specifically one that decided on access to contraception), the larger
attack on abortion laws could take place, and *Roe* was decided. *Roe*
built on the foundation of *Griswold*, arguing essentially that if a
woman had a Constitutional right to privacy, then she should have the
unfettered ability to decide what to do with her body, which includes
the ability to abort the baby growing there.

*Roe* is a legally unsound decision, because it was decided
*specifically discounting whether or not the baby was alive, and
therefore had a right to life.* *Roe* basically said that since there
are so many dissenting opinions regarding whether or not the baby really
is alive, and there are so many points at which we *could* determine
whether or not the baby is alive, we're just going to ignore all of it
and not even address whether or not the baby has rights (or whether or
not we are violating them). Some quotes from the majority opinion in
*Roe*:

> *We need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins. When
> those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine, philosophy,
> and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus, the judiciary, at
> this point in the development of man\'s knowledge, is not in a
> position to speculate as to the answer.*

Basically, what this all says is that since, at the time, they couldn't
figure out exactly when life began (and therefore rendered the baby
*alive* and deserving of human rights), they would punt that question
down the road. **However, if science, philosophy, and theology ever do
figure it out, the entire basis for the decision in** ***Roe*** **would
be upended.**

States passing abortion laws today are stating that ***we do know when
life begins, and we do know that the fetus is, in fact, human, and is
deserving of human rights.*** Of course, this runs counter to what *Roe*
allows, and so they are basically setting up a legal challenge to *Roe*
designed to overturn it. They *want* organizations to sue them claiming
that their laws are unconstitutional because they violate a woman's
right to an abortion as described in *Roe*. They *want* this challenge
to get to the Supreme Court so that the current crop of Justices can
decide on whether or not *Roe* was a good decision Constitutionally.
They waited for strict constructionists to have a majority on the Court,
and now that they have it, they are pushing the issue in the only way
they can: write a law which violates the "right."
