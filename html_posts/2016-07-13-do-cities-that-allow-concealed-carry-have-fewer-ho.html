Short answer: **NO.**

Longer answer: **The two subjects (homicide and concealed carry) are
completely unrelated.** In order to facilitate such a comparison, you
have to be able to correlate homicide rates to concealed carry in some
meaningful way. In other words, you will have to show how concealed
carry affects the rate of homicide. There are only three ways that I can
think of off the top of my head: are you trying to determine if
concealed carriers will *stop* a homicide? Or are you trying to
determine if concealed carriers will *commit* homicides? Or are you
trying to determine if concealed carriers are less likely to be the
victims of homicide because they are armed?

- If you're assuming that concealed carriers will *stop* homicides, you
  are already assuming facts not in evidence. You will first have to
  determine whether or not concealed carriers *should* intervene, by
  determining the purpose of concealed carry among all concealed
  carriers. The ***vast*** majority of people who carry concealed
  firearms realize that they only carry a **gun**, not a badge. They are
  not required to, nor should they, come to the defense of everyone and
  anyone on the streets. I carry *my* concealed firearm to protect *me*
  and *my family*. You have as much freedom to do the same. I'm going to
  be very loathe to step into another armed conflict, because doing so,
  ***even if I'm right***, is fraught with legal challenges and will
  likely take me years (and many dollars) to sort. Even if I'm legally
  in the right. I am not being defended by the city, as police officers
  are. I am not protected by law, as police officers are. I'm not going
  anywhere near your armed conflict. So no, in most cases, concealed
  carriers are not going to intervene in a situation unrelated to them,
  so it's unlikely that more concealed carriers will mean more prevented
  homicides of other people.
- If you're assuming that concealed carriers will *commit* homicide, we
  can actually look at those statistics. In Texas, for example, citizens
  with concealed carry licenses are 14 times less likely to commit a
  crime. They are also five times less likely to commit a violent crime.
  \[1\] People with concealed carry licenses are 5.7 times less likely
  to be arrested for violent offenses than the general public, and 13.5
  times less likely to be arrested for non-violent offenses than the
  general public. Of all the alternatives to preventing mass public
  shootings, police officers believe that civilian concealed carry is
  the most effective. 86% also believe mass shooting "casualties would
  likely have been reduced" or "avoided altogether."\[2\] So no, the
  numbers bear out that concealed carriers are the least likely group to
  commit homicide.
- If you're trying to determine whether or not concealed carriers are
  more or less likely to be the victim of homicide, you could probably
  look at the percentage of them killed in homicides, but I don't think
  those numbers are tracked, nor are they published (i.e. homicide
  victims who were CCW permit holders), and any such comparison would be
  specious as each encounter is different (was the person armed, did he
  present armed resistance, etc). In many cases, aggressors want
  unarmed, compliant victims, and when a victim refuses to be a victim
  by presenting armed resistance, the aggressor will break off and flee.
  This often occurs without a single shot being fired. It is estimated
  that there are between 1 and 2 million defensive gun uses each year,
  and it's only an estimate because many times when a gun is used
  without a shot being fired, a police report is never filed, so
  reliable statistics do not exist.\
  \
  Additionally, as is noted in the second bullet, concealed carriers
  are, on percentage, *more* likely to be law-abiding citizens than the
  general public. It is logical to assume that fewer of them will engage
  in criminal activity of any kind, so it is also logical to assume that
  fewer of them will be involved in situations where homicides routinely
  take place (i.e. associated with criminal activity). Therefore, a
  concealed carrier is less likely to encounter situations where
  homicides routinely take place.

So from an analysis of the situations in which homicide and concealed
carry may intersect, it is either unrelated, or impossible to determine
with any certainty whether or not cities which allow concealed carry
have their homicide rates impacted at all by that carry.
