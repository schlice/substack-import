**Content:** [Phones use DHCP (Dynamic Host Control Protocol) to obtain
new IP addresses from the carrier when the lease on the address expires.
You don\'t get a new IP address every time the phone reboots, only when
you restart the phone and the lease on the IP address has
expired.]{.rendered_qtext}
