**Do I need a paramotor pilot licence to fly one in the United States?**

No, licensing is not required by the FAA to fly an ultralight aircraft.
Paramotors are considered ultralight aircraft. They are governed by
Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) 103.

But "no licensing" doesn't mean "just strap one on your back and go
nutz!" You should absolutely get trained before you fly one. There are
some excellent schools you can attend to learn how to fly an ultralight,
and a paramotor specifically.

There are many excellent resources on the Internet to read up on before
you get started with paramotors. Some examples:
