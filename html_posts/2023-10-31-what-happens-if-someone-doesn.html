The homeowner would receive a communication from the HOA advising them
that they missed a dues payment. This would be through whatever
communication method was agreed upon by the homeowner and the HOA, and
is authorized in the Governing Documents and state law. It could be a
letter in postal mail, or it could be email.

If they do not pay, they will continue to accumulate late fees along
with the past due dues, and the HOA will continue to try to communicate
with the homeowner, at this point usually trying multiple communication
methods (phone calls, paper letters, emails, etc).

When the unpaid dues plus late fees go on long enough (or when they
exceed state-mandated minimums), the account gets turned over to the HOA
attorney to attempt to collect. The attorney will continue to tack on
the late fees as well as the past due dues, but they will also add
attorney's fees on to that total.

When the unpaid dues plus late fees plus attorneys fees goes on long
enough (or when the amount exceeds state-mandated minimums), the
attorney can place a lien on the property for the amount of the unpaid
money.

Once they've all had enough, they can foreclose on that lien and sell
the house out from under the homeowner to collect what they are owed.
