Why should I feel bad for my past sins? I was living in a state in which
I didn't know what I was doing was sinful, and depending on my frame of
mind at the time, I probably didn't care either.

What I *do* feel bad for is that I wasted so much time in my life, when
I could have been praising God and living in the way he wanted me to
live, rather than living in my own delusions, thinking that I was more
than I was, better than what I was, living in a "holier-than-thou"
mindset. I shudder when I look back at *how I was living*.

I don't feel bad about my sins, but I do feel bad for living like they
didn't matter.

In either case, God doesn't want you to feel bad for either your sin or
the way you lived.

Jesus died once, for all.

Accept Jesus now, and bygones become bygones. Jesus' blood washes us
clean. From here on out, we will be judged as brothers, as followers,
not as unbelievers.

Original question:

How can I confess my sins when I don't feel bad for my sins (sins in the
past I forgot about and sins in the present and future)?
