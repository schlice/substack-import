If we decide that women are nothing more than "baby factories" and they
can produce babies, give them up for adoption, and receive compensation,
then sure, why not.

But women are not "baby factories." There are no industries which exist
for creating and delivering babies to anyone. Babies are not a
"commodity" which are traded for compensation. No one is "compensated"
when they give a baby up for adoption. Giving a baby up for adoption is
an acknowledgement that a woman is not ready to, or is not in a
financial position to, become a mother, but she had a baby anyway.

I should think that the freedom to actually give up your baby for
adoption without cost to you is compensation enough, wouldn't you? The
ability to have a baby and then just "walk away" is probably a pretty
valuable thing, if we're considering value. But I suppose if you have
the moral capability to devalue baby life, you can consider the baby a
tradable commodity instead of a human being.

And let's not forget, when the woman gives up the baby, the state
becomes the *de facto* parent, and the taxpayers foot the cost of
raising that baby. Increased babies means increased taxes. Why would we
incentivize women to do this? Why would we compensate women and then pay
to raise their babies? Did you really want your state taxes to go up
that much? If *Roe* is overturned, taxes will have to go up as the state
works harder to match more babies with adoptive parents. There are still
plenty of adoptive parents out there, so that's not the issue. But the
state will have to process more adoptions, so their costs will
necessarily increase. Adding compensation for the mother incentivizes
women to get pregnant and give up their babies for adoption, and that's
still not the ideal solution. The state generally does not incentivize
solutions which are not ideal for the child, as they have a compelling
interest to promote the best outcome for the child.
