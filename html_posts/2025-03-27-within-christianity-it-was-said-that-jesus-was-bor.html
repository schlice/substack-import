An excellent question, and it gives me the opportunity to talk about the
two different facets of sin.

When Adam sinned, the human nature was corrupted by sin. Our bodies, and
our planet, were corrupted by the stain of sin. Every human lives in a
fallen, sinful body. This is what some call *original sin*. When we
stand before the throne of God, we are not specifically held accountable
for this sin.

There is a second category of sin: the sin we commit ourselves. This can
be either knowingly or unknowingly: in our thoughts and in our words, in
what we have done, and what we have failed to do. When we stand before
God on the day of judgement, *we are specifically held accountable* for
this sin.

With this in mind, we can answer the question.

Every human is affected by original sin, from the moment they are
conceived until the moment they die. This means fetuses, infants,
adolescents, adults, and the elderly are all similarly stained by
original sin. This is what Aquinas meant when he said that all newborns
a sinner according to Thomas Aquinas as they are born from the "loins of
Adam"**. Because Adam sinned, we are all affected by original sin.**

However, we are only *held accountable* for the sin we ourselves commit.
Here's the point: **because we are sinners, we all sin**.

I know, that's far too simplistic. Adam and Eve were in perfect bodies
not stained by sin when they sinned. So their sin was far more impactful
than ours. Our sin doesn't change the human condition. Our sin is
expected because we live in a fallen world in fallen, sinful bodies.

But (thank God) we have a way to atone for our sin. Jesus' sacrificial
death and resurrection pays the penalty for our sin: past, present, and
future. We are still subject to our sinful nature, but saved people are
no longer responsible to pay for it. Our sin debt has been paid; we were
bought with a price.

And amen and hallelujah for that wonderful truth.
