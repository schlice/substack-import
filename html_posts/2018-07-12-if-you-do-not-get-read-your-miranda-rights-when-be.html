**If you do not get read your Miranda Rights when being arrested does
that mean the arrest doesn't count?**

No, it does not. In fact, in most cases, your rights under Miranda are
not read to you when you are arrested.

Miranda rights only apply when you are being **questioned,** not when
you are being **arrested**. Before you are sat down to be questioned,
your Miranda rights will be read to you, and you will usually sign a
small form which indicates that you were read your rights, you
understand them, and you will also tick a box indicating whether or not
you invoked your right to counsel.
