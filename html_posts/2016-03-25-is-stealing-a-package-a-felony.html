In almost every state I know, theft of property is classified based on
the value of the property stolen and the circumstances of the crime.
Since I have Colorado Revised Statutes readily available, here\'s our
example:

**Class 2 Misdemeanor Theft.** When the value of the property stolen is
less than \$500, Colorado law classifies the theft as a class 2
misdemeanor (CRS §18-4-401(2)(b)), also known as \"petty theft.\"
Punishment for a class 2 misdemeanor is a minimum sentence of three
months and a \$250 fine, and a maximum sentence of 12 months and a
\$1,000 fine. (§ 18-1.3-501(1)(a)).

**Class 1 Misdemeanor Theft.** When the value of the property stolen is
\$500 or more but less than \$1,000, the theft is a class 1 misdemeanor
(§18-4-401(2)(b.5). Punishment is a minimum sentence of six months and a
\$500 fine, up to a maximum sentence of 18 months and a \$5,000 fine
(§18-1.3-501(1)(a)).

**Class 5 Felony Theft.** If property is taken from the person of
another, without force or intimidation (otherwise the offense could be
bumped up to robbery \[theft through force\]) or extortion (theft
through intimidation) (§18-4-401(5)), the theft constitutes a class 5
felony theft. It carries a sentence of one to three years imprisonment,
including at least two years of parole (remember that in Colorado,
parole is an additional punishment on top of jail time)
(§18-1.3-401(V)(A)).

**Class 4 Felony Theft.** If the value of the property stolen is \$1,000
or more but less than \$20,000, the theft is a class 4 felony
(§18-4-401(2)(c)). The sentence is a minimum of two years with a maximum
of six years imprisonment, with parole for a minimum of three years,
plus a fine of \$2,000 to \$500,000 (§18-1.3-401(V)(A)).

**Class 3 Felony Theft.** If the value of the property stolen is
\$20,000 or more, it is a class 3 felony (§18-4-401(2)(d). A class 3
felony carries a sentence of a minimum of four years and a maximum of 12
years imprisonment, with at least five years of parole, plus a fine of
\$3,000 to \$750,000. (§18-1.3-401(V)(A)).
