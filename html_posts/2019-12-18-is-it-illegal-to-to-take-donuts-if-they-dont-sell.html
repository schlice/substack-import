**Is it illegal to to take donuts if they dont sell and resell them at
another business you own my boss owns a speedway and another gas station
of his own and was wondering how to report him if it is illegal?**

Potentially.

For food which is prepared on-premise and sold without the need for
refrigeration, there are Federal and state food guidelines which govern
how long the products can remain on the shelf before they are sold. You
should know (or be able to find out) what those rules are.

Those items can be sold up until the appropriate sell-by date. They can
be moved from one display case to another, assuming that appropriate
temperature and cross-contamination controls are in place (i.e. wrapping
a tray of donuts and transporting them to another sale location).

If the donuts remain on the shelf for the full time, and then they are
transported to another store and re-displayed and offered for sale after
the sell-by date, this may be a violation. It would be up to the state
to investigate and prosecute that. The state's food service enforcement
section may have an anonymous tip line you might be able to use to
report your concerns.
