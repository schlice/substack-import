Yes, this is rape. Rape (in most states these days) is penetration, no
matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object,
or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the
consent of the victim.

Legally, at your age, you cannot consent to sex or any sexual activity,
so consent is not a factor.

You need to tell an adult you trust. This could be a parent. It could be
a school counselor or a nurse. It could be a pastor or a youth leader.
But please, find an adult you trust and tell them about it.

Original question:

I\'m 14 years old. Someone fingered me without my consent while I was
half asleep. Is this rape?
