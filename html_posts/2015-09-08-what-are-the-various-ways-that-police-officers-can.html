answer, there is one other feature of handcuffs that is also required
(for us) when they are used:\
\
Handcuffs ratchet closed in one direction. They only open with a key,
but they will continue to ratchet down as pressure is applied. The
forward ratcheting action can be locked with the small pin on the back
of the handcuff key:\

\
Once the handcuffs are \"double locked,\" they will no longer ratchet
closed. This allows you to close them to the point where they are not so
tight that they cut off circulation, but they will still retain the
suspect\'s wrists. The suspect will also not accidentally close them
further when placed in the back of a patrol car. Turning the key in the
other direction will release the double lock.\
\
I like the hinged cuffs because you can apply them with one hand more
easily while controlling the arm on which you are applying the cuff, and
they provide for less mobility when the suspect is cuffed. It\'s easier
to maintain positive control of the suspect while applying the cuffs.
