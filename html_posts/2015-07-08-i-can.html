**Content:** [You have what\'s called a [[foot
fetish](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5bffc2&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_fetishism){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"

\
First of all, it\'s not abnormal. It\'s not gross. It\'s a fetish. Some
guys are boob guys (I\'m a boob guy). Some guys are butt guys. You\'re a
foot guy.\
\
But just because I\'m a boob guy doesn\'t mean I don\'t consider a woman
as a whole, or only talk to her because she has attractive boobs (notice
I said \"attractive:\" not all boobs are attractive, and bigger is not
necessarily better). It\'s just a part of the female anatomy that I
happen to really (really) like.\
\
Please don\'t feel bad about your fetish. Elvis Presley was a foot guy;
[[Quentin
Tarantino](https://www.quora.com/topic/Quentin-Tarantino-3)]{.qlink_container}
is also a foot guy.]{.rendered_qtext}
