The Governing Documents of the HOA lays out the timeframes for the
election process.

Normally, the current Board will put out the call for nominations, and
homeowners who wish to run for the Board will need to submit an intent
to run to the management company. When all of the required paperwork is
filed, the management company will produce ballots and the election will
take place in accordance with the rules specified in the Governing
Documents, but usually in conjunction with the Association's Annual
Meeting. Homeowners may vote during the Annual Meeting, and the rules in
the Governing Documents will determine who is elected.

Board members newly elected begin their terms immediately and are
elected for varying terms depending on the state and the Governing
Documents.
