This particular trope has always amused me, like Adam was so morally
upright and Eve was just such a master manipulator that she *convinced*
Adam to eat the fruit against his better judgement...but she was still
tricked by a talking snake? How exactly do you square that circle?

No, Adam was *just as guilty* as Eve. Adam knew, just as Eve did, that
eating the fruit was *verboten*. But Adam, just like Eve, succumbed to
that most insidious of sins: ***envy.***

The serpent convinced Eve (and Adam by proxy) that God was keeping
something from them. That God was somehow "holding back" something that
the two had a right to have. And they became *envious* of that thing.

**This** was their sin, and they both engaged in it equally. No doubt,
the serpent (driven by Satan) was absolutely guilty of tricking them
into their envy, using their naïveté and their free will against them
(ironically, because he was jealous of God's love for His human
creation). But Adam and Eve both knew that eating from the tree was
wrong, and they did it anyway.

No, Eve was not more guilty than Adam. No sin is greater than any
other¹. All sin convicts us equally.

¹ Except for blaspheming the Spirit, which could only be done during the
time of Jesus. Only that sin was unforgivable.
