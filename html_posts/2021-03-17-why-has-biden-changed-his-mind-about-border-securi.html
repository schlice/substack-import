**Why has Biden changed his mind about border security. He has only been
in office around 60 days. He told the world on Jan 20 come in and we
will take care of you, now today he told everyone do not come until.we
get set up?**

Campaign promises have consequences. Biden was campaigning to the United
States voter. Except his words were reaching the global migrants.

Biden campaigned on the fact that he would be kinder and gentler than
Trump at the border, and voters responded. Clearly, voters wanted a
different approach than what Trump offered. Biden said he'd halt
deportations, stop building the border wall, and end the "wait in
Mexico" policy for asylum-seekers. After winning the White House, he
proposed an immigration policy which includes a path to citizenship for
illegal immigrants.

Predictably, this caused a ***massive*** flood of immigrants to hit the
southern border crossing. It caused a similar spike in illegal border
crossings, including very dangerous desert and water crossings. It was
predictable, because the administration predicted it. Ambassador Roberta
Jacobson, Biden's southern border coordinator, said of the migrant
surge, "Surges tend to respond to hope, and there was a significant hope
for a more humane policy after four years of, you know, pent-up
demand."[\[1\]](#RPetk){#cite-RPetk .citation_link}

But while their prediction skills seem to be on pointe, their
preparation skills seem to be sorely lacking. While they knew the surge
was coming, they did nothing to prepare for it. The need for increased
enforcement at the border plays very poorly to Biden's base, so instead
of implementing the unpopular but needed changes, he ignored it in favor
of pandering to his base.

Now the southern border is in crisis. Biden's words spurred on massive
migrant activity, and with no end in sight, Biden was forced to temper
his rhetoric. "Please let us get set up for you before you come" is the
tenor of his message, but that offers little condolence to migrants who
have been chomping at the bit for immigration policies to loosen. And
with all the hope he gave them, how can he deny them now?

It will be interesting to see how he handles it. Open borders is a
deeply unpopular concept. And short of open borders, it is exceedingly
difficult to loosen restrictions on immigration without increasing
enforcement activities.
