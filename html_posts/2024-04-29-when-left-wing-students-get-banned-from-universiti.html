If you believe that the right to free speech includes making threats to
people, you have much to learn about what activities are protected as
rights and where those limits are.

Verbal assaults are indeed illegal, and making death threats is indeed a
verbal assault. States have different names for these crimes, but they
all amount to roughly the same thing.
