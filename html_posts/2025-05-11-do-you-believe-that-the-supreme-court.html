The Supreme Court's power is already limited.

The Constitution checks the Judicial branch:

- The court does not have *original jurisdiction* in the vast majority
  of cases. It only has *appellate jurisdiction,* which means cases can
  be *appealed* to it, but cases cannot *originate* in it. There is one
  notable exception: cases involving disputes between two or more
  states, cases where a state is a party, and cases affecting
  ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls. This means these
  cases are initially tried in the Supreme Court, not a lower court, and
  the Supreme Court\'s decision is final. In every other case, the case
  must be heard by a lower court and then appealed to the Supreme Court.

The Legislative Branch checks the Judicial branch:

- Justices on the Supreme Court are subject to impeachment, just as any
  other federal official is. The Legislative Branch can impeach a
  Justice.
- Finally, the Legislative Branch can override a Supreme Court ruling by
  re-writing an offending law in such a way that it does not violate the
  Constitution. In that way, the law is still in effect, but it simply
  does not violate the Constitution.

The Executive Branch also checks the Judicial branch:

- The Executive Branch checks the Judicial Branch through its power to
  nominate judges, issue pardons, and enforce court decisions. The
  President nominates judges, including Supreme Court justices, but
  these nominations require confirmation by the Senate. The President
  also has the power to issue pardons for federal crimes, which can
  influence the outcome of judicial cases. Finally, the Executive Branch
  is responsible for enforcing court orders, which is essential for the
  judicial system to function effectively.
