It's easy. Just ask your parents' permission! They'll be happy to either
help you get laid, or help you kill yourself.

Or maybe, they'll help you through this period of teenage angst that
*literally every other teenager in the entire world* goes through.

I'd probably bet that they'll go with the third option. You should, too.

Original question:

I am 13 and I still haven't gotten laid. How do I kill myself?
