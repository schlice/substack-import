**The Democrats say they\'re going to impeach Kavanaugh from the DC
courts based on the allegations against him. Is this now moving into a
legal matter rather than just a job interview?**

Impeachment is a political process, not a legal one.

There's not enough evidence in Dr. Ford's testimony to even get a search
warrant in an actual court of law. And she even has standing to try.
There is no statute of limitations on felony sexual assault in Maryland.
The police in Maryland stand ready to investigate anything she wants
them to investigate, they've already said so in a public statement. All
she has to do is level the charge in Maryland. Oddly, she hasn't done
that. Maryland won't investigate without her say so, as they have a very
"victim-centered" policy, understanding that some victims don't want to
pursue charges, and they respect that.

Understanding that impeachment is a political process and not a legal
one, would Democrats have enough political capital to get an impeachment
vote passed? To be honest, if Kavanaugh is not appointed to the Supreme
Court because this specter of allegations hangs over his head, is he
still fit to serve on the DC Circuit, arguably the second highest court
in the nation? I would say that if he's not fit to serve on the Supreme
Court, he's not fit to serve on the DC Circuit either, and Democrats
would be justified in impeaching him from the bench.

I mean, they've already burned his life to ash. Why not finish the job
and stomp on the ashes? Impeach him from the DC Circuit. He'll never
practice law again. He couldn't even be a judge in a city traffic court.
He will be completely and utterly ruined. An allegation, completely
uncorroborated after **seven FBI investigations**, can ruin a man's
life. Thanks, #metoo.

We know this isn't a legal matter, but if this is a job interview, it's
the worst job interview ever. Either you get the job, or you'll never
work anywhere ever again.
