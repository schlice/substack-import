**Will Trump\'s new executive order undo the political backlash/damage
of the family separation policy or is it too late?**

Nothing can undo political backlash. Democrats are going to ride this
train until the end. Or at least past 2020.

What's more important is that he fixes the problem. I suspect that one
way or another, he's going to do something that will keep families
together at the border.

If he simply signs an EO that says that children can stay with their
parents, it will immediately be challenged in court. I bet the 9th
Circus already has the injunction written, just waiting for the EO to be
signed. His signature won't even be dry before the injunction is filed.
He could also go this route just to say "I tried" and blame everyone
else. I would be sad if he did this. He has a real opportunity to make a
fix here, without Congresscritters' help.

What he *could* do is treat illegal entrants who are also asylum seekers
simply as illegal entrants rather than asylum seekers. We should deport
*everyone* who is an illegal entrant, rather than holding asylum seekers
for a hearing with an immigration judge. If he could speed up the
deportation process and get illegal border crossers out of the country
within 20 days, we could forestall the separation of children
completely.

So it's a wait-and-see game right now.
