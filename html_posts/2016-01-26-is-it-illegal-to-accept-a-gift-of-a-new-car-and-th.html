It is not illegal to transfer the title and then resell the car. Once
you transfer the title, you own the car and can do what you like with
it, including throwing it off of a cliff if you choose, although that
would be a terrible waste of money.

I would absolutely question the morality of such a transaction. You have
to consider that a \"friend\" who buys you something as expensive as a
car does not want to be a friend any more. He has to want something,
whether he is saying as much or not. It is said that there is no such
thing as a free lunch. It is **exceedingly** rare for something so
valuable to be given with no expectation of any sort of reciprocity.

In short, the most likely scenario is that he\'s fishing for something.

I would politely refuse the car. Tell him that 1. it\'s too much, and 2.
you already bought a car.
