**Content:** [The United States is one of the last industrialized
nations which has not passed universal workplace bullying laws. This is
because laws surrounding \"workplace bullying\" are generally seen as
opening up the possibility of frivolous lawsuits. Can you legislate
civility? Should you have to?\
\
The fear is that when you write workplace bullying statutes, you open
the door to all sorts of frivolous lawsuits. Essentially, every
disgruntled employee becomes a potential plaintiff. Companies will spend
their time mediating disputes to avoid lawsuits, and they\'re going to
hear all sorts of \"he was mean to me\" disputes.\
\
The fact of the matter is that most employers know that legislating
against workplace bullying is not the answer. Most employers know that
when you foster a culture of kindness and respect in your workplace,
your employees are more productive, and thus make you more money.
Employers must create respectful workplaces themselves, and it must come
from the inside out.\
\
It is true that laws will force employers to create company-wide
guidelines, but if an employer is drafting guidelines because he has to
comply with a new law, the guidelines will be the absolute minimum to
comply with the letter of that law. If you really want to address
workplace bullying, employers have to take the reins themselves and
create top-down, inside-out climates of respect for all employees. In
some companies, this will represent wholesale change; for others, it\'s
business as usual.\
\
Since 2003, half of the states in the US have introduced workplace
bullying legislation that would allow employees to sue for harrassment
without having to show discrimination. Some state laws are better than
others. Take Massachusetts\' law which was passed in 2013. It says that
an abusive workplace environment is one where \"an employer or one or
more of its employees, acting with intent to cause pain or distress to
an employee, subjects that employee to abusive conduct that causes
physical harm, psychological harm or both.\" Massachusetts was
surprisingly smart in implementing this legislation, as they wisely
included an intent clause which should help to weed out a lot of the
frivolous nonsense that such laws can create.\
\
As an aside, my employer is based in Massachusetts, but we have had HR
guidelines since I joined 15 years ago which aim to foster a respectful
workplace. We are already compliant with the new law, without having to
change a single thing.]{.rendered_qtext}
