So you're looking for **good proof of God's existence**, which is what I
understood your question to be.

If it's so difficult to prove God's existence, let's try something that,
in theory, should be much easier:

**Prove that God doesn't exist.**

Let me stop you before you try to answer that; it was a rhetorical
question. **You can't prove that God does not exist.**

As legal scholar and philosopher Mortimer Adler said, \"An affirmative
existential proposition can be proved, but a negative existential
proposition\--one that denies the existence of something\--cannot be
proved.\" For example, someone may claim that a red eagle exists and
someone else may assert that red eagles do not exist. The former only
needs to find a single red eagle to prove his assertion. But the latter
must comb the entire universe and literally be in every place at once to
ensure they have not missed a red eagle somewhere and at some time,
which is impossible to do.

This is why you cannot prove that God does not exist.

But even that aside, that doesn't prove that God exists, does it? No, of
course not.

So let's look at it this way:

- We exist. We are not an illusion.
- We didn't create ourselves, because you can't exist before you
  existed, and spontaneous self-creation isn't a thing.
- Therefore, we were created by a necessary and eternal *something*.
  Note that it must be eternal, because anything that has a beginning
  has a cause. Nothing exists without a cause, unless it is eternal and
  uncaused. So whatever created us must be eternal. If it has a
  beginning, then it must have been caused by something else. The Law of
  Causation says this.
- There are only two possible causes for us: an eternal universe, or an
  eternal creator.
- Science and philosophy have proven that the universe had a beginning,
  and is therefore not eternal. We were, therefore, not created by the
  universe. The universe had a beginning and thus a cause, so it could
  not have been our creator.\
  \
  Additionally, the Law of Causation goes on to say that an effect must
  resemble its cause. Atheists have yet to explain how an impersonal,
  purposeless, meaningless, and amoral universe accidentally created
  beings (us) who are full of personality and obsessed with purpose,
  meaning, and morals.
- Therefore, the only remaining option is an eternal creator.

Clearly, there is a lot more detail than this, and this alone can't
answer all of your questions. If I may, a really good book to read on
this very topic is called [[*I Don't Have Enough Faith to be an
Atheist*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=770f5b&url=https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Have-Enough-Faith-Atheist/dp/1433580756){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}. It goes through the entire
argument very slowly and carefully, and the logic is sound. I really
suggest you read it.

Original question:

I have been trying to look for good proof of God and I'm struggling.
What do you think would help me? Does God even need proof?
