**My neighbor is parking his four cars in front of my mailbox, and the
post office has threatened to fine me. What can I do?**

Despite what others have said, the correct answer is "it depends."

In general, it is not illegal to park in front of a mailbox *unless*
your city has made it illegal to do so. Therefore, technically it's not
illegal for them to park where they are.

Frustrating matters is the fact that USPS, while they can't fine you,
can skip delivery to repeatedly obstructed mailboxes. The theory is that
having to have the carrier get out of the mail truck for every
obstructed mailbox hinders their efficiency, and everyone gets their
mail late.

When on-street parking is allowed *and* your city does not have laws
against parking in front of mailboxes, you should do a few things:

1.  Notify USPS that it is not your car blocking your mailbox. This way,
    they won't stop delivery to your box. If they really think they can
    fine someone for parking in front of a mailbox (which is interesting
    since they're not the local parking authority, that's the local
    city), tell them to fine the owner of the car, not the owner of the
    mailbox.
2.  Place a note on the offending car reminding them that the Post
    Office requires a clear 30 foot approach in order to safely deliver
    mail, and asking if they can park in a safer spot.

If your city does have parking restrictions related to on-street
mailboxes, notify your city's parking enforcement division, or your
local police department's code enforcement division.
