No. He didn't ***assault*** a nurse. He ***arrested*** a nurse.

If he was taught this particular facet of evidence handling (i.e. when
he can and can't force the hospital to give him a blood sample), **he
should lose his job because he didn't know the law, and conducted an
unlawful arrest.**

If he was never taught this (I can't imagine he wasn't, but it's not my
place to not give him the benefit of the doubt), then he should be
placed on administrative duty, re-trained, and assigned appropriately
after review by senior staff. However, because of the publicity this
case has generated, it's likely he'll be quietly retired instead.
