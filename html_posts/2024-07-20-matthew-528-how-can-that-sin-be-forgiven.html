Jesus really made a big challenge here. Previously, people were under
the Ten Commandments which said you shall not commit adultery. But then
Jesus comes along and says "Now you're under the new law, and if you
even *look* at a woman lustfully, you have already committed adultery
with her in your heart."

WOW. That's nuts, right? I can't control my mind! It's going to think
what it wants to think! How is this even possible to do?

**And that's the point.**

Jesus is telling everyone that **on your own, it is impossible to be
good enough.** Merely following the law is not enough. No one is
righteous, not one (Romans 3:11). No one is "good enough" on their own
to merit salvation.

But with God, all things are possible.

It is **only Jesus** who can save you. You can do nothing on your own to
earn salvation. Only through repentance and faith can you be saved.

Therefore, that sin, along with every other sin, can be washed away by
the blood of Christ. His death gives us life. His sacrifice redeems us.
He alone is worthy.

**TL;DR: How can that sin be forgiven? Repentance and faith.** ***This
is the way.***
