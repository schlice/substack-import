The vaccine is the right choice for most people, and if you are able,
I'd encourage you to get it.

**But it's not the necessary choice for everyone.**

For example, if you've already had COVID-19 and recovered, you already
have antibodies against the virus. You don't need more. The government
says it's a good idea, and maybe it is. You know, like wearing your seat
belt *and* wearing Kevlar while you drive, but the truth is that it's
not necessary.

So what you do is entirely dependent on whether or not you want to keep
your job, and whether or not you have the funds to fight a legal battle
against unlawful termination.

No one here can advise you what is right for you. You are free to not
take the vaccine, this is your choice. Don't listen to the fearmongers
trying to scare you into taking the vaccine. They don't really care
about you. They care more about protecting themselves against some
unquantifiable threat. Their fearmongering is all about them, not you.
You are no more of a threat to them than I am, as I, as a vaccinated
person, can still get COVID-19 and can still pass it on, and if I can do
that, I can also harbor and create a new strain just as easily as you
can. So don't listen to their nonsense.

**That said, you have to be prepared to deal with the consequences of
your own choices.** The vaccine will only protect you, not them. Without
it, you could contract severe COVID-19, and you could die. While the
chances are pretty low, they are there. That risk is on you.

Good luck!
