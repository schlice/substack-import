**The constitutional rights of Georgia voters were violated this month
by a system overseen by the man who won the governors' race, a lawsuit
backed by Stacey Abrams has claimed. Why?**

The lawsuit claims that some voter practices in Georgia not only violate
the right to vote for the citizens of Georgia, but also that they are
discriminatory because they unequally impact African-Americans.

Her lawsuit claims that it is unconstitutional for a state to purge its
voter rolls of those who have registered to vote but have not voted for
"several years." This is a matter of Georgia law.

Her lawsuit also claims that the "signature check" that the state does
to compare the voter's signature to the signature on the voter roll is
also unconstitutional. The signature check is also a matter of Georgia
state law.

Finally, her lawsuit claims that because Georgia does not have adequate
voting machines, voters had to wait in "long lines" which I guess is
also unconstitutional.

Who knows, maybe they will find somewhere in the "emanations and
penumbras" of the Constitution that purging voter rolls of those that
don't vote is unconstitutional somehow, while I'm not sure what
particular Constitutional provision you would be violating by properly
and adequately maintaining your voter rolls. Personally, this sounds a
bit like sour grapes to me.

Also, it's interesting that when a Democrat claims that an election was
mishandled (such as in Georgia, no matter how unfounded the complaint
may be), they are lauded as a "class act" and a patriot, but when a
Republican claims that an election was mishandled (such as in
neighboring Florida, using documented, court-confirmed irregularities in
two counties), then somehow they're "undermining democracy."

Hrmph.
