**When people go on talk shows to take lie detector tests, can they take
the results to court to help their case?**

Of course they can use the results from a lie detector. But they
probably won't want to, since lie detectors are notoriously inaccurate.

To that end, if the polygraph is the only evidence they have, it can be
easily nullified as little more than chance.
