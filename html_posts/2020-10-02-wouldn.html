**Wouldn\'t it be smarter for Trump to cite the Garland precedent as a
reason to not select a nominee to the SC, and make the vacant spot a
campaign energizer?**

You can be sure that someone on Trump's team (not Trump, mind you) has
already thought of this. And it is a viable strategy. If the 2016
election was partly a referendum on Scalia's seat, couldn't they do that
again?

Certainly, they could employ this strategy. But at least one political
strategist has rightly noted that Democrats have been clearly saying for
the last few months that they believe the President has been obstructing
mail-in balloting because he thinks it will benefit Democrats, or he
thinks it will enable election fraud, or whatever, and they have clearly
vowed to take this election to the courts. It almost seems like a
foregone conclusion that at least one, if not more, state elections will
end up being decided by the courts in 2020.

If you were Trump, would you want to almost assuredly send the election
to a 4--4 split in the SCOTUS, when the state courts and appeals courts
(who will hear the case first) are largely liberal controlled?

So which one then is more risky? Leaving the seat vacant until after the
election and making filling the seat an election issue and going into
the election with a 4--4 split, or going into the election with a
textual originalist majority to decide the election and leaving the
election up to the people's choice between Trump and Biden? If you're
Trump, you know that the election is going to the courts, one way or the
other, regardless of who is elected on November 2nd (if we even have a
clear winner by then). He'd rather have a full court to decide the
election than have another issue to energize his base.

And what if Trump ends up losing? He loses the opportunity to seat a
textualist majority on the SCOTUS which will affect the direction of the
courts for *decades* after both Trump and/or Biden or anyone else has
vacated that office. That's an opportunity that his base would most
definitely excoriate him for passing up.
