**Why is incest always paired with rape in abortion exceptions? Forced
incest would still fall under \"rape\", and otherwise, it is still
consensual sex.**

It is still mentioned in order to handle some older exceptions to rape
laws.

In actuality, forcible sex by anyone is rape, and when not forcible, it
falls under coercion, but it is still non-consensual.

It is still listed simply because of some older definitions of rape.
