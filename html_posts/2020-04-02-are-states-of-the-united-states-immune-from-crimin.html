**Are states of the United States immune from criminal prosecution by
the federal government under the doctrine of sovereign immunity? This
question is about the states themselves, not the officers of states.**

A state is a legal entity. You cannot prosecute a state, as a state
cannot commit a crime. You can only prosecute people, because only
people are capable of committing crimes.
