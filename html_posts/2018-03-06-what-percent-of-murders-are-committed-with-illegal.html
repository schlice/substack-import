**What percent of murders are committed with illegally obtained guns?**

The actual answer is that we don't exactly know.

We can come fairly close to a good answer. Interestingly, Joe
Scarborough made the claim on his show that something like 3% of murders
are committed with legally purchased guns. Politifact [[looked into that
claim](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=61080e&url=http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/oct/05/joe-scarborough/msnbcs-joe-scarborough-tiny-fraction-crimes-commit/){.external_link

It seems that a lot of these numbers are being derived from interviews
of prisoners. But here's what we do know:

So I think the answer to your question is "a very low percentage" of
firearms used by criminals in crimes are actually legally purchased.

We know that the number of mass shooters below 21 who legally purchased
their guns is strikingly low: **one**. The others either stole them or
made straw purchases.
