**If a police officer drove his cruiser into another county could he be
pulled over?**

Generally, rules aren't so different between counties such that
something legal in one county is patently illegal in a neighboring
county. And if such a situation were to exist, ***and*** the county in
question was so set on charging that offense that they would stop
deputies from the neighboring county, you can bet that everyone would
know about it and would never break that rule. Besides, I can't imagine
a worse environment between two counties actually existing, and there'd
have to be a lot of greater issues in that state than just two Sheriffs
who disagreed on a particular policy.

It's never a good practice to have any of your deputies stopping other
deputies. It is certainly conceivable where such a situation could take
place, but it's really unlikely. What you would normally do is notify
your own chain of command what you saw and let them communicate to the
other county what they found.
