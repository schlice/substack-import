**How is Delta offering a non-stop flight from LAX to Tokyo NRT in a
Boeing 737?**

Answer: it doesn't. Delta does not flay a LAX to NRT route, and does not
use the 737.

However, **a 737 is capable of flying a LAX-NRT route.**

There is a great video you should watch so that you can understand why
this is now possible. It's about 9 minutes long.

It has to do with changes to flight regulations which previously stated
that two-engine planes could only fly no more than 60 minutes away from
any airport.

However, as time went on and engines became increasingly more reliable,
these rules were severely outdated.

In 1985, ETOPS (Extended-range Twin engine Operational Performance
Standards, or more colloquially, Engines Turn Or Passengers Swim) rules
were put in place (begrudgingly) for TWA (Trans World Airlines) to fly
their twin-engine 767 between Boston and Paris. ETOPS certifications for
aircraft mean that they are built with appropriate redundancies, fire
suppression and communications systems to fly safely if one engine
fails. The 767 previously mentioned has an ETOPS type rating of 180
minutes, which means it can fly anywhere as long as it is within 180
minutes of a diversion airfield. An ETOPS 180 rating means that 95% of
the world's surface becomes available for aircraft to fly over.

The granting of ETOPS type ratings allowed carriers to start serving the
"long and thin" routes that are inefficient to fly with larger aircraft.

The LAX-NRT route is, indeed, one of these "long and thin" routes. If
you check the [[Great Circle
Mapper](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=fa006c&url=http://www.gcmap.com/mapui?P%3Dlax-nrt%26MS%3Dwls%26DU%3Dmi%26EV%3D397%26EU%3Dkts){.external_link

qt-tooltip="gcmap.com"}]{.qlink_container} for the LAX-NRT route, you
see that it is well within the ETOPS 180 and over-water rating for which
the aircraft has been certified.

The Boeing 737--700ER (Extended Range), with its up to 9 auxilliary fuel
tanks, can fly up to 5,510nm. Again according to GCMap, the LAX-NRT
ideal route is 4,736 nm (5,451 mi), something the 737--700ER can handle
easily.
