If you are asking as a matter of law, the answer is no. Disabled people
do not get paid less because they are "labeled" as disabled.

If you are asking as a practical matter, then it's possible that a
disabled person may not get the same job opportunities or the same
promotion opportunities because they were labeled as disabled and some
manager believes that the disabled person is somehow unworthy of the
additional pay or position. This would also be something not based on
any actual job performance. The job performance would be the same as
their fully-abled counterparts, but somehow they would be paid less.

This, by the way, in the United States, is highly illegal and opens the
employer up to massive lawsuits for violating the Americans with
Disabilities Act.
