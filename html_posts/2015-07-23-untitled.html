<h2>Answer Comment</h2>
<div>

**Content:** [It is only analogous if you believe that an abortion ends
a life. The law says that abortion does not end a life. Therefore,
abortions never kill people.\
\
The implication by the gun control crowd says that more guns = more
violence. The tenor behind \"Guns don\'t kill people, people kill
people\" is a shorthand expression that the gun is a tool, and on its
own, it doesn\'t do anything. As you rightly noted, it takes a person
operating the mechanism with a will to operate that machine to cause a
death. The gun is just the tool that they use to end the life.\
\
In order to conflate abortion into that statement would presume that an
abortion ends a life. In today\'s law, abortion does not end a
life.]{.rendered_qtext}
