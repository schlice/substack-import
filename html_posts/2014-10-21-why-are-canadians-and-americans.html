**Content:** [Part of the problem is that we don\'t really understand
the true definition of a GMO. For example, if I cross-breed a plant with
another, is that considered a GMO? There is a lot of confusion in the US
as to what constitutes a GMO. Thankfully,
[[Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4ff5f0&url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_organism){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);" qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}
]{.qlink_container}has provided the definition of a GMO:\
\
\"A **genetically modified organism** (**GMO**) is an organism whose
genetic material has been altered using genetic engineering
techniques.\"\
\
\"Genetic engineering techniques\" are \"the direct manipulation of an
organism\'s genome using biotechnology.\"\
\
So cross-breeding a plant is not considered GMO, but the large majority
of scientific evidence we have so far shows that GMOs are not very much
different from cross-breeding plants.\
\
There is a lot of controversy and the issue has been politicized. In
fact, in the state of Colorado, the November 2014 General Election has a
ballot question which will add labeling to food produced in the state if
it contains GMOs.]{.rendered_qtext}
