**Do cell phones emit unique, intercept-able signals (when they
communicate with anything: wifi, cell towers, bluetooth)? Can you tell
one phone\'s signals apart from another\'s?**

Let\'s discuss cellular communications, since Wi-Fi and Bluetooth work
exactly according to their respective protocols, regardless of whether
it\'s a phone, a laptop, or a tablet.

For cellular radio communications, yes they do, but the equipment needed
to intercept it is prohibitively costly for the casual listener.

Remember when "police scanners" used to be a thing? You could listen on
many different channels at the same time.

But police technology improved. They went to digital trunked radio
systems and mobile data terminals. Listening in on those transmissions
today would sound like old telephone modems. You still could (assuming
they\'re not frequency hopping or using spread spectrum), but you need a
special DAC (digital to analog converter) to do it, and they are not
cheap.

Cell phones today are the same. They communicate using all digital
signals between the tower and the handset. You would need a very
specialized DAC setup to even get close to being able to hear anything.
But cell phone radios use specialized broadcast techniques to save
battery and improve bandwidth, and these techniques do not lend
themselves to easy interception.
