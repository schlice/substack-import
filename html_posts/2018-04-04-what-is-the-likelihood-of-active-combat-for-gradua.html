**What is the likelihood of active combat for graduates of USAFA?**

It depends entirely on the AFSC into which the grad is placed. Not all
AFSCs deploy regularly, and even for those that don't regularly deploy,
there are groups within those AFSCs that are worldwide deployable and do
regularly deploy. For example, I was a 33S (Logistics and
Communications) on the comm side. There is comm at every base of every
size worldwide, but we didn't deploy routinely. However, a group within
the 33S career field (combat comm) *did* deploy routinely, but only if
you were a part of combat comm.

Pilots and cops, across the entire AFSC, are likely to be sent to active
war zones pretty quickly.
