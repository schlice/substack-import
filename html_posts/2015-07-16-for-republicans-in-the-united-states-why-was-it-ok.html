**Content:** [It wasn\'t okay for either of them to do what they did.
But what they did is a little confusing, and the question makes clear
assumptions that Republicans are somehow okay with Iran-Contra while
being not okay with the nuclear agreement with Iran.\
\
The Reagan deal you speak of was called the [[Iran--Contra
affair](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=76c3b8&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%25E2%2580%2593Contra_affair){.external_link

sale of arms to Israel, who then shipped the weapons to Iran. The US was
paid for the weapons by Israel. The US could not directly give arms to
Iran since it was still under an arms embargo. In exchange, the Iranians
agreed to do everything they could to secure the release of US hostages
being held by the Contra rebels in Nicaragua. To this day, it is still
unclear whether or not Reagan actually authorized such a deal, even
though he publicly supported the idea. It is generally recognized that
subordinates working for Reagan, most notably Lt. Col (ret) [[Oliver
North](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9e96ec&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_North){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}, actually planned and
executed the deal. The military even coined a term, \"Ollieism,\" still
taught today in US military education schools, whereby a subordinate,
doing something he believes his superior to be supportive of, does
something illegal under the illusion that he will be supported by his
superior.\
\
Obama\'s deal with Iran is completely different. Obama negotiated a deal
directly with Iran to allow them to develop nuclear capabilities.
They\'re not supposed to develop any nuclear weapons (we have \"their
word\"), but we have given them the green light to enrich uranium, which
is the long pole in the tent to developing nuclear weapons. The jump
from enriched uranium to nuclear weapons is a short one. Most experts
agree that Iran will have nuclear weapons. The deal doesn\'t give us
much legs for oversight, even though there is some token oversight in
there. The deal restores trade with Iran, giving them a much-needed
economic boost, which most experts agree will head straight to Hezbollah
and Hamas in the form of new rockets to shoot at Tel Aviv. As you can
imagine, Israel isn\'t happy about it. Obama said exactly this during
his press conference:\
\

> weapon.\

\
And it\'s a country we\'ve just given the green light to enrich uranium.
This will only heighten tensions in the region, as Egypt and Saudi
Arabia are going to pursue nuclear aspirations to defend against the
soon-to-be-nuclear Iran.\
\
To heighten the massive stupidity of this deal, Obama also declared that
Congress can\'t stop it, and he would veto any attempts to overturn the
deal. So Congress\' Constitution authority over trade deals has also
been usurped.\
\
Maybe Reagan knew about Iran-Contra, maybe he didn\'t. I won\'t justify
Iran-Contra by saying that Reagan\'s a good guy so he had the best
intentions so it\'s okay. Iran-Contra wasn\'t okay, and neither was
Obama\'s Iran deal.\
\
Obama\'s deal, in contrast with Iran-Contra, is very **harmful**. It\'s
harmful to the region. It\'s harmful directly to Israel. It creates the
path for Iran to get nuclear weapons, in a shorter amount of time (8
years instead of 10). There\'s enough flexibility in the agreement that
Iran can hide their stuff before inspectors arrive. \"See? Nothing going
on here.\" It creates incentive for neighboring nations to pursue their
own nuclear ambitions. It gives Israel incentive to attack Iran
pre-emptively. Instead of easing tensions, it makes them worse.
