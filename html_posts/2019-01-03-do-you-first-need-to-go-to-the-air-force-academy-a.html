**Do you first need to go to the Air Force Academy and then apply to the
Pararescue?**

No. You do not need to be a USAFA graduate to enlist and become a PJ.
You can enlist in the Air Force and go into the Pararescue career field.

Here's some information about the Air Force Pararescue career field.

[[U.S. Air Force - Career Detail -

Here's the basic requirements to enlist in the US Air Force:

- Be between 17 and 39 years of age.
- Be a U.S. citizen or legal, permanent resident
- Have a high school diploma, GED with at least 15 college credits, or
  GED

You can become a PJ after graduating from the Academy, but the career
paths are indeed different.
