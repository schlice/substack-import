A no confidence vote would simply remove the person from office. Trump
would go back to Manhattan and would resume CEO duties for the Trump
Corporation.

If Trump himself was removed from office under such a vote (if we had a
mechanism to do that), the 25th Amendment (and its subsequent
definitions) would kick in, and the Vice President would become
President for Trump's remaining term.

We don't have a "no-confidence" vote because we are fairly confident
through over 250 years of precedent that we can peacefully vote someone
out of office when the next election rolls around. The people have
decided that four years is enough time to give someone to either
generate confidence, or prove that they have none. Precedent has shown
us that the only necessity would be to make someone a "one-term
President."
