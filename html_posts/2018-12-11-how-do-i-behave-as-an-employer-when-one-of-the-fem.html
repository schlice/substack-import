**How do I behave as an employer, when one of the female employees is
too attractive and many times she\'s been a love target for other male
employees?**

It seems like you're trying to make the assertion that your male
employees are pigs and can't control themselves, and the poor
defenseless woman who is simply too attractive for her own good needs to
be shoehorned into a closet for her own safety.

Perhaps you'll have to clarify a little bit of your question so we can
answer it more thoroughly.

- "How do I behave" --- What exactly does this mean? Are you asking what
  you do about this "untenable" situation?
- "Too attractive" --- Are you saying that your employee is in violation
  of some dress or personal appearance standard at your workplace? If
  she is, then you deal with that issue. If not, then I don't see that
  there is anything you need to concern yourself with.
- "Love target" --- This doesn't even make sense. Are you saying your
  male employees simply cannot control themselves? Are they acting
  inappropriately around her? If not, she can likely handle herself.

Here's how you handle it: if your female employee has been harassed, you
deal with the harassment complaint when it comes up. If she comes to you
complaining of a hostile work environment, you fire the men responsible
for creating a hostile work environment.

It mostly seems like what you have to do is fire the children, and you
hire **adults** next time.
