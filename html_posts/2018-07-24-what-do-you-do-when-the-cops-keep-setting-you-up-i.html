**What do you do when the cops keep setting you up intentionally to be
arrested using illegal surveillance to strategically set up elaborate
false arrests?**

Wow, where do you live? The police in your town literally have *nothing
better to do* then to set up elaborate false arrest scenarios using
"illegal surveillance" to specifically target *you*? Either your local
cops are really really bored (which is a good thing) or you did
something to really really piss them off such that they'd waste lots of
time and risk cases getting thrown out of court by using "illegal
surveillance" just to give you a hard time.

Regardless of why the police are doing this, what you do is **get a
lawyer.** If the police really are targeting you, using "illegal
surveillance" to harass you, your lawyer will help you file suit against
the department alleging harassment.

If, on the other hand, their surveillance is actually legal (or if it's
wiretaps, supported by a court order), you're going to need that lawyer
to defend yourself, because some pretty hefty charges are soon to come
your way.

So in either case, the remedy is the same.

Get a lawyer.
