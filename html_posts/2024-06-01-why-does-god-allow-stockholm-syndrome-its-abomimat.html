Cool, a two-fer! Two questions in one! Let's jump right in:

> **Why does God allow stockholm syndrome?**

Why does God allow *any* evil to exist in the world?

First of all, **if you believe that somehow God is obligated to explain
Himself to us, you ought to do a better job reading the Bible**.
Proverbs 25:2 says, "It is the glory of God to conceal a matter." Isaiah
45:15 says, "Truly You are a God who hides Himself." First Corinthians
2:11 says, "No one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God."
Deuteronomy 29:29 says, "The secret things belong to the Lord our God"
(NKJV). Ecclesiastes 11:5 says, "As you do not know the path of the
wind, or how the body is formed in a mother's womb, so you cannot
understand the work of God, the Maker of all things." Isaiah 55:8--9
says, "'For My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My
ways,' declares the Lord. 'As the heavens are higher than the earth, so
are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts higher than your
thoughts.'"

It appears as if the Bible is telling us we don't have the capacity to
understand God's infinite mind or the plans He has for us. It's
arrogance for us to believe we have the ability to understand the mind
of God. It's like you standing over a pregnant mother's womb and trying
to explain what life is like on the other side, in such a way that the
baby in the womb would understand. That baby simply doesn't yet possess
the capacity to understand. Paul told the believers in Corinth, "Now we
see but a poor reflection; then we shall see face to face. Now, I know
in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known" (1 Cor.
13:12). Paul was basically saying that we may not ever gain full
understanding while we are alive on earth, and we probably need to learn
to accept that.

Secondly, **no one ever said that being a Christian would mean a
problem-free life**. If you've ever looked into any of the lives of the
great men and women of the Bible, their lives were not the most
glamorous. Look at Joseph. His brothers and sisters hated him so much,
they sold him into slavery. When in Egypt, he was thrown in prison,
falsely accused of rape, and threatened with execution. During the
entire ordeal, there is no indication in the Bible that God explained
his plan to Joseph. He was simply expected to live out his life in
less-than-complete understanding, as you and I are. *What pleased God
was Joseph's faithfulness when nothing else made sense*. Stephen was
stoned because he proclaimed God's name. James was put to death with a
sword for his faithfulness. Paul was persecuted, stoned, flogged, and
beheaded in a Roman prison. During their lifetimes, they never knew
God's great plan for them. Jesus even said that life wouldn't be easy.
He said, "I have told you these things, so that in me you may have
peace. In this world, you will have trouble. But take heart! I have
overcome the world" (John 16:33).

Throughout the Bible, it tells us not only that bad times can happen,
but that we should ***expect*** bad times to come because we live in a
*fallen world. Bad times will come.* Yet somehow, we still expect God to
take away all of our problems, spearheading our walk through life with
his massive cosmic leaf-blower, clearing our path of any trials,
hardships, or pain. This causes a great deal of anxiety, even among
long-time faithful, because life is hard.

The Bible tells us to not bother trying to understand, not to bother
trying to make all the pieces fit together. "Trust in the Lord, lean not
on your own understanding" (Prov. 3:5). We are not told to not try to
understand, just don't "lean on" your understanding, which means don't
make it an ultimatum. "God, you'd better explain yourself, or I'm outta
here!" That would be "leaning" on your own understanding, and we are
admonished against that.

So what does this all mean? Basically, expect trouble in life, and
expect that there will be situations we do not understand. Faith is the
point at which logic stops making sense. We must have faith that God
will keep His promises, and that everything we go through in this life
has a purpose, even though our minds do not have the capacity to
understand it.

> **why does he allow and grant heaven for severely mentaly noncapable
> people who can't understand complex thing like God or religion**

So rather than focusing on mental handicaps, let's zoom out a little.
Because while the Bible doesn't address it specifically, it does talk
about babies and children, and the same principles can be applied to the
mentally handicapped.

The bottom line is that God doesn't condemn people for things they have
no ability to do (cf John 9:38-41). According to this principle, babies
and young children who are unable to accept or reject Christ are not
held accountable for that unbelief. Similarly, those with mental
handicaps who are unable to accept or reject Christ are not held
responsible for that either. The Bible says that those who face
judgement are those who refuse to acknowledge what is "clearly seen" and
"understood" concerning God (Romans 1:20). People who, upon seeing and
evaluating the evidence of nature, make the choice to reject God are
"without excuse." ***Those*** are the people for whom hell will be their
final destination.

> **its just unfair**

***UNFAIR????*** ***Are you certain you want what's fair?***

Because that's **justice:** *everyone gets exactly what they deserve*.
And we, each and every one of us, have sinned. We have all fallen short
of God's glory. Every one, without fail. If God were to ***fairly***
judge every one of us today, we would all absolutely deserve hell. That
would be **JUST:** we would each get exactly what we deserve.

We should rejoice that God tempers His justice with MERCY and GRACE.
Mercy means we don't get what we deserve (and that's to go straight to
hell), and grace means we get what we don't deserve (a Savior who took
the penalty we deserve on our behalf). He gave us this gift of grace
WHILE WE WERE STILL SINNERS! Christ died for us while we were still
sinners. What an amazing gift!

God never promises that everything will always be "fair." But He
promises that He will temper His justice with His grace, and for that,
He deserves our praise.
