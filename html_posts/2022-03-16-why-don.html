Ah, an easy question. And there are a few really good answers:

**1. Because he claimed he was God.**

If he was actually *not* God, and was actually a magician, then he was
either a liar, or he was insane. Not really someone worth believing in.
A magician has no ability to save my eternal soul.

**2. Magicians perform sleight-of-hand, not miracles.**

A miracle, as defined by Oxford, is "a surprising and welcome event that
is not explicable by natural or scientific laws and is therefore
considered to be the work of a divine agency." Sleight-of-hand may
*appear* to be miraculous, but it actually can be explained by natural
or scientific laws. Miracles, by definition, cannot be explained by
science. So if a "miracle" has a scientific explanation, it's not a
miracle.

For those reasons, it doesn't make sense that he *is not* God.

Original question:

Why don\'t Christians believe Jesus was a magician, as weird though it
seems, it is not as big a leap as he was God?
