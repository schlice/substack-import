The difference regarding whether or not you can take your stolen and
then recovered car back is whether or not your insurance has already
paid out the comprehensive claim on your car. If you have comprehensive
insurance and your car is stolen, your comprehensive coverage pays you
the fair market value for your car.

If your insurance has not yet paid off your car, you do have to take it
back. And I would posit that you would *want* to take it back, even if
you are just taking it back so that you can immediately turn around and
sell it, because insurance didn't pay you for it. Even if you don't want
it anymore, not taking it back in the event that insurance didn't pay
for it would be throwing money away. You *can* refuse to take it back,
but why would you? If you refuse to take it back for long enough,
adverse possession laws kick in, and the car becomes the property of the
impound lot. Impound lots love people like this. They get free money.

But if your insurance has already paid you out of your comprehensive
insurance, then **your insurer legally owns your vehicle** and they
decide what to do with it. Similar to what my commenter said, the
impound lot (and eventually the junk yard) is full of cars that
*insurance companies* *wrote off as a loss.* So if the police call and
tell you they found your stolen car and it's in the impound lot, tell
them that insurance already paid out for that car and it's not yours
anymore.
