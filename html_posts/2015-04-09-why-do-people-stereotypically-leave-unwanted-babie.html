It\'s not a \"stereotype.\" It\'s a \"law.\"

This is a picture of Fire Station 19 in Colorado Springs. See that sign
that I circled?

That\'s the symbol on the sign. It has to do with the Colorado \"Safe
Haven Law\" which states that any mother can leave any baby, up to 72
hours old, at any fire station or hospital, without fear of being
prosecuted for abandonment, no questions asked. So long as the baby is
unharmed, you\'re good to go, literally.

All 50 states have Safe Haven laws on the books.

The rationale for the fire station is that fire department personnel are
more heavily trained as paramedics and EMTs than police. In fact, 70% of
calls that firefighters roll on are medical calls, not fires. Fire
department rescue vehicles roll on all sorts of medical situations. In
fact, some jurisdictions have ambulance services that have teamed up
with fire departments and run joint ambulances. Most police departments
do not have their own ambulance services, and while police are generally
trained as medical first responders, they are not EMT or paramedic
certified, while most firefighters are.

(EDIT) Additionally, fire stations are a better choice for Safe Haven
drop points because people feel much more comfortable giving their baby
to a firefighter (who cannot arrest them) than to a police officer (who
can, but shouldn't in this scenario). Making Safe Haven drop points be
police stations might deter some people from using them, so the logical
choice is the fire department.
