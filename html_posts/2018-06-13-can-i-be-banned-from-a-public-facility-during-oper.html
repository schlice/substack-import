**Can I be banned from a public facility during operating hours while
having committed no crime and have no restraining order against me?**

Yes.

You must understand that most buildings are not "public facilities," but
are actually *private facilities which are open to the public.* Public
facilities are owned by the government, like the courthouse or City
Hall. Private facilities which are open to the pubic are places like
restaurants and coffee shops.

The manager can ask anyone to leave for any non-protected reason
(protected reasons would be because of your race, sex, religion,
national origin, or in some jurisdictions, sexual orientation). The
management must apply this rule equally to all customers, whatever it
is.

For example, if the manager bans all tank tops, then management must
equally ban all people who wear tank tops.
