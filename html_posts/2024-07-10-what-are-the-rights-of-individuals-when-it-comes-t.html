It depends on who owns the parking lot.

If the parking lot is privately owned, they can set whatever rules they
choose as to who can park in their lot. Their facilities (including any
parking lots owned by them) are theirs to use as they see fit. There are
some requirements set by the state in terms of accessibility (i.e. a
certain number of spaces need to be designated as handicapped, etc), but
beyond that, it is up to the business to determine how they manage
parking spaces.

Sometimes, spaces are individually assigned, such as in some lots
adjacent to (or sometimes, underneath) apartment complexes. The complex
can assign spaces, and can tow vehicles which are parked there when they
do not belong. The tow companies will usually post signs at the entrance
to the lot indicating that the lot is controlled and parking is by
permit only and violators will be towed at the owner's expense. Your
rights, if you are one of these people who parked in a controlled lot or
space and your vehicle was towed, are limited. You must pay the tow
operator a fee to cover his costs to tow your car. There are limits (set
in state law) as to how much they can charge, but those limits are
agreed upon and are permitted by state law.

If the spaces are on public roads or public property, there really is no
ownership of the spaces other than by the government which controls that
area (city, county, etc). That government can set parking rules on those
spaces, and can similarly tow vehicles in violation to an impound lot.
