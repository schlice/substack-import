First, before we can answer this question, we need to clear up what an
"error" is.

Some have estimated there are about 200,000 errors in the New Testament
manuscripts. First of all, these are not "errors" but variant readings,
the vast majority of which are strictly grammatical (i.e., punctuation
and spelling). Second, these readings are spread throughout nearly 5,700
manuscripts, so that a variant spelling of *one* letter of *one* word in
*one* verse in 2,000 manuscripts is counted as 2,000 "errors."

Textual scholars Westcott and Hort estimated that only *one in sixty* of
these variants has significance. This would leave a text 98.33 percent
pure. [\[1\]](#Ejikp){#cite-Ejikp .citation_link} Philip Schaff
calculated that, of the 150,000 variants known in his day, only 400
changed the meaning of the passage, only fifty were of real
significance, and *not even one* affected "an article of faith or a
precept of duty which is not abundantly sustained by other and undoubted
passages, or by the whole tenor of Scripture teaching."
[\[2\]](#njvCZ){#cite-njvCZ .citation_link}

So when we say "zero errors," we are talking about errors which would
modify "an article of faith or precept of duty;" in other words, an
error would be something that changes the religious understanding of a
passage.

There are indeed zero of those errors.

The part about that statement which is so amazing; indeed, supernatural,
is the fact that the Bible is not one book but 66 books written in three
languages by about forty different authors on three continents over the
span of about 1500 years. And with all of that time and space between
them, there is **complete unity** in the message, and there are, indeed,
**zero errors** (of the kind we identified already).

There is absolutely no way that such a thing could be accomplished by
the exertions of humans.

**That's why the Bible has zero errors: because the Bible writers were
divinely inspired.** In fact, the lack of errors is indeed a hallmark of
this divine inspiration.
