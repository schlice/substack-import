**Content:** [There is one other doctor who is doing similar work. Dr.
Roy L. Swank has developed the [[Swank MS
Diet](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=fafb36&url=http://www.swankmsdiet.org){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="swankmsdiet.org"}]{.qlink_container} which has helped
thousands of people slow their disease progression and live a healthier
life. This is a statement that I can believe. I believe that good diet
and exercise can slow disease progression and help you live a healthier
life.\
\
However, you cannot \"treat\" MS by changing your diet. No disrespect
intended to Dr Wahls; her life\'s transformation was amazing. But to be
blunt, if you \"had MS\" and then changed your diet and you \"cured your
MS\", you didn\'t have MS. MS cannot be cured with dietary changes. See
my answer on [[What are the best treatments for Multiple
Sclerosis?](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-treatments-for-Multiple-Sclerosis)]{.qlink_container}
for more information on my view on this topic. I have seen this many
times and have been told about similar things many times. I actually was
on the Paleo diet for about a year, and its overall effects were very
good for me. I lost weight, I was able to focus better, and I felt like
I had more energy. The diet, however, did not cure my MS. I still have
MS. I didn\'t expect it to cure my MS. I expected to lose weight and
feel better, which I did.\
\
Like I said in my other answer, here\'s the current take on \"best
treatment for MS\": eat right, exercise, and take one of the disease
modifying drugs. There are now many to choose from, including two oral
medications, and they all do the same thing: slow the disease
progression, and lessen the duration and severity of relapses. Do all of
these things, and you will be on your way to controlling this
\"slow-motion train wreck\" of a disease we call MS.]{.rendered_qtext}
