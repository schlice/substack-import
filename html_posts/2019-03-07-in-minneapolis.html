**In Minneapolis \"photo cop\" traffic cameras have been ruled
unconstitutional (MN constitution) because you can\'t prove/show who
exactly was driving. Why aren\'t they unconstitutional in the rest of
the U.S. as well?**

Presumably, this is because other state constitutions don't positively
require the driver to be identified before a citation can be issued.

In other states, it may be that you can get the ticket thrown out if you
can positively prove that you were *not* the driver. For example, in
Colorado, if the photo shows a woman driving and the vehicle is owned by
a man, the ticket can be tossed.

Also, in other states, citations from red light cameras do not impact
your driving record in any way. No points are assessed on your license;
they don't show up on your insurance, etc. But if you don't pay them,
they go to collections and can negatively impact your credit.
