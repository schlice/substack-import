**Was Trump's decision to do an airstrike in Syria illegal according to
the US Constitution since he did not get approval from Congress?**

Quick Constitution lesson.

Military action has two competing clauses in the Constitution. First,
the President is declared in Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 as "the
Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the
Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of
the United States." Congress, in Article I, Section 8, Clause 11, has
"the power to declare war."

To this day, there is a continual tug of war between the Executive and
the Legislative branches regarding the use of military force and which
branch has what power, and to what extent they can exercise that power.
For a more detailed reading about the legislative history of those
struggles, the Legal Information Institute has a really nice write-up on
the history of [[War
Powers](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=dc6313&url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/war_powers){.external_link

qt-tooltip="cornell.edu"}]{.qlink_container} in the United States, and
the legal cases which follow. That article shows that the courts have
fallen on both sides (legislative and executive) depending on the case.

This leads one to believe that war powers *should* be split between the
two branches, and backs the assertion that the Framers *intended* the
power to declare war be split between the two branches so that one
branch does not have exclusive control over the ability to wage a full
scale war counter to the interests of the nation.

Now, back to the question.

The issue about procedures for the President and Congress related to war
was *largely* (not completely) settled when Congress passed the [[War
Powers
Resolution](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e5a346&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_powers_act){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}. It states that the
President must report to Congress within 48 hours of committing armed
forces to military action. It forbids armed forces from remaining for
more than 60 days (with a further 30-day withdrawal period) without a
Congressional authorization for use of military force (AUMF) or a
[[declaration of
war](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3a5b23&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_war_by_the_United_States){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"

qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}.

Thus, the President can act to *commit* troops, but Congress must act in
order to *maintain* troops in place.

**TL;DR: Therefore, based on current interpretations of the separation
of war powers, the President can initiate military action unilaterally,
without Congressional approval, but Congress would be required to
authorize any ongoing military operations.**
