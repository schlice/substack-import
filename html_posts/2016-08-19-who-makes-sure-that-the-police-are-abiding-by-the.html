There are many groups which oversee the police.

- To start with, a local police department works for the city. This
  oversight is generally accomplished by civilian oversight boards or
  committees appointed by City Council, or the Mayor. These boards will
  either review police internal investigation findings or will "sit in"
  on police review boards while they take place. Similarly, a local
  Sheriff's Department works for a county Board of Commissioners and is
  subject to similar civilian oversight
- The District Attorney is charged with investigating police conduct
  when allegations of criminal behavior are made. The DA is a lawyer who
  works for the state, not the police department. To be fair, the DA
  works closely with the police all the time, so he/she may be somewhat
  partial when doing investigations. They aren't supposed to be, but it
  happens.
- The public is constantly watching the police. As an officer, every
  time you step out of your car, you can rest assured that there is at
  least one camera phone videoing your every move, just hoping to catch
  you doing something illegal so they get their 15 minutes. Video is
  ubiquitous these days, so you must assume that your every move is
  being recorded by someone, and unless you want to become the subject
  of the next "viral video," you ought to check your actions.
- And while you may not think it to be right, the chain of command
  within the police department would like nothing better than to never
  see a reporter in front of their desk. To ensure this, they constantly
  review the actions of their officers to ensure compliance with
  department policy. Note that this is not technically violation of the
  law, but violating department policy can cost you your job.
