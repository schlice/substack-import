U. S. military academy cadets from any academy can **cross-commission**
into another service. They can apply for, and accept, a commission in
any service, depending on availability of slots in the other service. I
had several USAFA classmates who took Army or Marine Corps commissions.

The number who cross-commission is very low; generally if you're at the
**Air Force** Academy, you'd really like to be in the **Air Force**, and
similarly for the other service academies. But perhaps there was some
other factor that didn't allow you to get into the service academy of
your choice, so you entered whatever service academy you could make it
into with hopes of cross-commissioning. Or perhaps, as in my classmates'
cases, you have a better chance of doing the job you really want to do
in another service than in the Air Force. Regardless, we had roughly
1200 graduates in my class, and I think there were maybe 10 cadets who
cross-commissioned.
