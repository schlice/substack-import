**Is it illegal to sell your house to a family member?**

Nope.

If you own your house, you can sell it to whomever you like, for
whatever sum of money you choose.

If you want to sell your house to your sister for \$1, you are free to
do so, so long as there are no other unpaid financial obligations on
that house.

In other words, so long as there is no mortgage, you hold the actual
deed to the house in your hot little hands, and you don't have any other
liens against the property, you can sell that house to anyone.

Heck, if you properly and legally turn over title to the property to
someone else, you can even *give the house away as a gift*.
