There was an interesting thought question that was running around a few
years ago. We can use it to answer your question.

Assume that Hitler, on his deathbed, truly, honestly, and openly
confessed his sins, truly repented, and accepted Christ as his savior. I
mean truly, in his heart, believed what he did was wrong, confessed his
sins, and accepted Christ.

Would he be in heaven now?

The answer, maybe surprisingly, is yes.

And if a truly repentant Hitler could be saved and live eternally with
God, so can we.

Our past sins are in the past. Our past sins are covered. Being saved
means we *repent* of (which means turn away from) our past sinful life.
We *reject* that life. We *reject* those ways of thinking. Instead of
focusing our thoughts on those old ways, we focus our minds and our
hearts on God.

Will we stumble? Sure. We're still human. We still make mistakes. But we
don't make the same old mistakes. We don't live in our sin. We live
*better* than our sin.

**TL;DR: Repent and believe, and you will be saved.**

Original question:

Will God forgive me if I\'ve rejected him for years and broke at least
half of his commandments? Even if he does, will he still allow me to go
to heaven?
