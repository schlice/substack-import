**Because the government has a compelling interest in safeguarding
children.**

The only reason that the government cares (or should care,
legislatively) **at all** who you marry is because **sex between men and
women regularly produces children.**

Not always. Not mandatory. *Regularly*.

Marriage has, for centuries, been the exclusive purview of the church.
Whether or not you were married was for the church to decide.

So why is the government involved at all?

The state has a compelling interest in safeguarding the welfare of
children. It is a tremendous burden on the state to care for unwanted
children. Therefore, ensuring that there is a stable family which can,
and desires to, raise a child is important to the state.

Secondly, and this is the point that most people love to disagree with
but that doesn't make it less of the truth, all reputable statistics
show that a child has the ***best*** possibility of a positive outcome
later in life when they are raised in a common household with their
biological parents. All other configurations of family have a lower
possibility of a positive outcome. Before you run screaming to the
comments, note that I did not say that it is impossible for a child of a
single mother or a child living with two women to have a good life and
experience a positive outcome. I know several in my own life. And I also
didn't say that being raised in a home with your biological parents
***always results*** in the best outcome (I'm living proof of that).
What I said (which I'll repeat because even the bold and italics don't
give it away) is that the ***best*** possibility of a positive outcome
is achieved by a child being raised in a common household with their
biological parents.

Therefore, the state incentivizes the relationship they wish to
cultivate. They offer tax breaks to married couples who choose to marry
to raise children. The offer survivorship benefits to ease the
transition of property from parents to children.

This is why the state cares who you marry. It's not because they want to
dictate who you love, or because they're homophobic, or for any other
reason you can come up with. The only reason the state is involved at
all is because of their role in safeguarding the welfare of children.
That doesn't make a marriage invalid if you don't have children. It
doesn't mean that you must marry to have children. It doesn't mean
anything else other than the following:

- The state is concerned with the welfare of children.
- Sex between men and women (and no other combination) regularly
  produces children.
- The state recognizes (for better or worse) that a child has the best
  chance of a positive outcome later in life when they are raised in a
  common household with their biological parents.
- Therefore, the state incentivizes the family configuration that offers
  the child the best possible chance for success.

To answer your question, this is the only reason why the state is
concerned with who you marry.

\

Of course, after *Obergefell*, where the Supreme Court redefined
marriage for all the states, this all went out the window. Now you can
marry whomever you want.

And the slippery slope begins. Next up: if two men can marry, why can't
I marry two women? Or have a group marriage?

After that: why can't I marry my dog?

After that: why can't I marry this 11 year old?

Love is love after all, right? States really have a hard time saying no
to any of that, considering all the arguments made in *Obergefell* now
equally apply to any other marital arrangement you can think of.
