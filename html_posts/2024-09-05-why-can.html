So enjoying the female form is normal and natural. There is nothing
wrong about it.

What *can* be troublesome is, as you said, if you **can't stop** looking
at naked women, which implies that you *tried* stopping and you *can't*.
Depending on what's happening in your life, you could have a *porn
addiction.*

Here's some signs of someone who has a porn addiction:

- Spending large amounts of time watching porn
- Being unable to stop using porn or behaviors associated with porn,
  despite repeated attempts to do so
- Experiencing cravings to view porn
- Becoming angry or hostile when asked to stop using porn
- Requiring increasing amounts or more explicit porn to gain the same
  satisfaction
- Losing interest in intimacy with one's partner
- Abandoning social activities to use porn
- Keeping all or part of one's porn use secret from loved ones

If these describe you, you could have a porn addiction. If you do, you
should seek counseling in your area.
