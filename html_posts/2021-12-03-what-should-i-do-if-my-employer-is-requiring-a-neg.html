Get the test. There really isn't much more you can do. Get the test and
go back to work.

This virus will eventually move out of the *pandemic* phase and into the
*endemic* phase, as it mutates to becomes more *virulent*, but less
*lethal*. Then, you'll just get your "combined flu/COVID shot" every
year and it will be no big deal. Getting COVID will be no more or less
dangerous than getting the flu (which itself is already minimally to
moderately dangerous), and whether or not you get it (the shot, the flu,
or COVID) will be no one's business again.
