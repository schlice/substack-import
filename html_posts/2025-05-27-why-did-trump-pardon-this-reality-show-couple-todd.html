The pardon followed a petition detailing what was called \"serious
misconduct\" by federal prosecutors and violations of the couple's
constitutional rights, according to their attorney. The petition for
pardon alleged that the couple\'s conviction was based on an illegal
raid, reliance on compromised evidence, and false testimony by a key
government witness. During their incarceration, both Todd and Julie were
recognized for their behavior, with Julie earning 43 educational
certificates and Todd advocating for better prison conditions---efforts
that, according to the firm, contributed to the closure of a dangerous
federal facility.

Their daughter, Savannah Chrisley, spoke at the 2024 Republican National
Convention, where she thanked then-candidate Trump for what she called
standing up \"against political prosecutions and fighting for families
like hers.\" Savannah said during her podcast that she was working
behind the scenes to get her parents pardoned. She also frequented the
White House, and with her appearance at the RNC, it's likely that Trump
knew of the Chrisleys and their plight. So when the petition hit his
desk, he was (I'm sure) already sympathetic. And with support from
members of Congress and other community and civic leaders, it was
probably a pretty easy call to make.

\"This pardon corrects a deep injustice and restores two devoted parents
to their family and community,\" said Alex Little, a partner at Litson
PLLC. \"President Trump recognized what we've argued from the beginning:
Todd and Julie were targeted because of their conservative values and
high profile. Their prosecution was tainted by multiple constitutional
violations and political bias.\"

\"Todd and Julie's case is exactly why the pardon power exists: to
correct misguided prosecutions and reaffirm basic constitutional
protections,\" Little said. \"Thanks to President Trump, the Chrisley
family can now begin healing and rebuilding their lives.\"

Is that really why the President is pardoning them? We'll never truly
know. But there's not really any reason to believe otherwise.
