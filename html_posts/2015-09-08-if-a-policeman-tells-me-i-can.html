**Content:** [If you are not interfering with the officer, and you are
both in a public place (like on a sidewalk), you can record the police.
There are some restrictions in some jurisdictions, but for the most
part, if you are a safe distance away and not interfering with the
officer\'s duties, you are free to record away.\
\
If you record an officer telling you that you can\'t record him, I would
take that video to his supervisor and remind them that you are permitted
to record the police, show them that you weren\'t obstructing the
officer, and advise them to get their officers training on the current
state of the law.\
\
If they don\'t do a good enough job teaching their officers about the
law, I would take the videos to the local TV station. Let their
\"investigative reporters\" grill the police chief about why they can\'t
get their officers trained in current law.]{.rendered_qtext}
