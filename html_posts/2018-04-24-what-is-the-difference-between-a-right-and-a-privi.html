**What is the difference between a right and a privilege if you believe
that rights are only granted by the state and can be taken away?**

Well, if you (incorrectly) believe that rights are granted by the state
and can be taken away, then there is no difference between a right and a
privilege, which is granted by the state and can be taken away.

If, however, you believe the *actual* definition of a right, which
contains a *moral* obligation or permission to do or say something,
which is *not* granted by the state, then there is a big difference
between a right and a privilege.
