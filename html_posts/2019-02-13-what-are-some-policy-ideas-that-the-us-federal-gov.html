**What are some policy ideas that the US federal government could enact
in order to help stabilize and control the cost of health care/medical
coverage? What can be done to make health care actually affordable or
easily to subsidize for all?**

I really think that in order to make this happen, we're going to have to
implement a dual system.

People don't like to hear "dual system" because it makes them think of
the "haves vs the have-nots" and that's simply not the case. Get it out
of your head.

We ***can*** have basic healthcare covered for all people, and we
***can*** keep our current insurance companies in business, but each of
those will be incomplete.

We ***won't*** have Medicare cover 100% of people for 100% of medical
issues, and we ***can't*** continue having private insurance cover 100%
of medical issues. Neither system is workable.

What I see as a future path is to enact a modified version of Medicare
Part B for everyone. No enrollment necessary; if you have a Social
Security Number and are a US citizen, you are covered. All basic
healthcare up to a point (we'll get there later) is covered. All doctors
are included (if you billed private health insurance before, you bill
Medicare now). Obviously, family practice doctors will end up billing
Medicare much more than they do now, but that's the way it is. The vast
majority of things that family practice doctors do will be covered by
Medicare, not by private insurance. No pre-existing conditions, no
limitations, no coverage questions. You're all covered, period.

There will be a line. And yes, that line can move over time. We can move
procedures between basic care and specialized care. It can be done.

Beyond that line is specialized care. It's where specialist doctors
live. It's where hospitals and surgeons and complex and costly
procedures and advanced diagnostics live. And it's all funded by private
health insurance. Everyone can buy private health insurance. Private
health insurance will have to work much more like, oh I don't know,
***actual insurance*** instead of a complex prepayment plan like we have
now. And since private health insurance will be paying for much less
than it does today, anyone can afford private health insurance. Much
like automobile insurance, you can buy private health insurance
yourself. Or your employer can pay for a portion of it. I suspect that
most employers will continue to provide private insurance to their
employees, much as they do today, but without all the complexities they
include now. They will be under no obligation to do so, however, because
people can buy their own. The cost structure and repayment structure
will necessarily become simpler, since again, they're paying for much
less than they are today. Again, much like traditional insurance.

This can be done. The two systems can co-exist. People can afford
private insurance. The government can afford to cover all citizens'
basic healthcare. If we stick with this idea that it has to be all or
nothing, then we'll end up with nothing.
