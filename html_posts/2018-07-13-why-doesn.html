**Why doesn't Twitter ban nude pictures? Isn't it illegal to look at
them in the US?**

It is not illegal to look at nude pictures in the United States. The
First Amendment actually prohibits the government making any laws that
would restrict free speech, and nude photographs are generally covered
by freedom of expression. They can limit that speech by requiring that
Twitter protect that speech from consumption by minors, but they can't
pass a law making it illegal to post them.

Twitter, on the other hand, is **not** the government. Twitter is a
private company, and it can regulate the content on its own platform
however it chooses. If Twitter chose to restrict that content or
eliminate it altogether, it can absolutely do that if it wants to. But
that's a decision for Twitter to make.
