**Content:** [Depends on the type of corporation. There are some
differences in personal liability between LLCs and S Corporations (thus
the term \"Limited Liability Corporation\").\
\
First of all, most corporations have liability insurance for their
officers that protects them in the event that they are personally sued
while acting on behalf of the corporation.\
\
In most cases, an officer of the corporation can be held personally
liable if he or she:]{.rendered_qtext}

- personally and directly injures someone
- personally guarantees a bank loan or a business debt on which the
  corporation defaults
- fails to deposit taxes withheld from employees\' wages
- intentionally does something fraudulent, illegal, or reckless that
  causes harm to the company or to someone else, or
- treats the company as an extension of his or her personal affairs,
  rather than as a separate legal entity.

\
That last one is important, because if the officer treats the company
and his personal affairs the same, a court could find that the company
doesn\'t exist separately from his personal affairs and he could be
liable for the sum total of any judgments against the corporation.\
