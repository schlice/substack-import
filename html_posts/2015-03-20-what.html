**Content:** [Presumably, you have a full flight and passengers have
checked in and hold boarding passes for all the seats. A number of
passengers also have tickets for that flight, but there are no more
seats. The difference in whether or not you will be compensated for
changing flights is whether or not you are currently holding a boarding
pass for the flight (i.e. you\'re booked on to the plane instead of
having a ticket and no boarding pass).\
\
As you get closer to flight time for an overbooked flight, the airline
will offer compensation for passengers to rebook onto a later flight.\
\
If you are not currently holding a boarding pass, you\'re mostly out of
luck. You can wait to see if anyone else leaves, or you can have them
book you on a later flight. You\'re not getting anything for it either,
because you checked in last (after the plane was full).\
\
If you are holding a boarding pass, wait them out. The closer to flight
time you get, the more compensation you will receive for switching to a
later flight. Be careful though, if you wait too long, the compensation
they are currently offering may be good enough for someone else\...\
\
The \"keyword\" to use when you\'re standing at Customer Service being
booked onto another flight is \"inconvenience.\" When explaining that
you need to get to place X to attend function Y, you need to add that
this \"is a terrible inconvenience.\" Customer Service reps know that
they need to compensate \"inconvenienced travelers\" lest they take
their business elsewhere where they will not be inconvenienced by the
inept practice of overbooking.]{.rendered_qtext}
