**Content:** [In America, we also have pay-as-you-go wireless. It also
consists of \"loading\" or \"reloading\" your phone with certain numbers
of \"minutes\" or \"days\" depending on the carrier.\
\
People like the convenience of pay-as-you-go phones. No contracts, no
long-term service agreements, just fill the phone as you need it and
nothing more. You can even buy the refill cards with cash, so there\'s
no paper trail. A popular choice for criminal activities (in the
vernacular, these would be called \"burner\" phones). However, even
those phones can be traced back to the store from which they were
purchased, and if a credit card was used, that information can also be
retrieved, and the purchaser can be found.\
\
However, if you compute out the cost per minute, you find that the
pay-as-you-go plans are much more expensive than contract plans,
especially now that most US-based carriers have switched to charging for
MBs of data instead of minutes; most plans that charge per MB have
unlimited voice and SMS included.]{.rendered_qtext}
