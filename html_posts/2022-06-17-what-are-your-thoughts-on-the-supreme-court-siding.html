That's not what the case was about.

The Border Enforcement Zone has always existed, and it continues to
exist before this case.

But this most recent case (*Egbert v. Boule*) was about being able to
sue Border Patrol over an alleged violation of Constitutional rights,
and receive damages.

The Court said that a remediation structure already exists, and anyway,
the court isn't the place to get those damages; it's up to Congress to
set up a process for damages.

Original question:

What are your thoughts on the Supreme Court siding with border patrol
agents to allow them to take your 4th amendment right if you live 100
miles near the coast?
