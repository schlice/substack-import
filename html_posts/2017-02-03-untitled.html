*Candidate endorsements - not condemnations but endorsements - are
simply at odds with the tax code under which your pastors willingly
signed themselves.*

Pastors did not "sign the tax code." The government has ***never***
collected taxes from churches. Ever. As I mentioned, the money belongs
to the people, and it is up to the government to show why they need it.
And since churches are validly tax-exempt non-profits that have been
outside of the government's legitimate tax base since the founding of
the nation, the government has no automatic right to the church's money
just because its pastor won't give up his constitutionally protected
right to free speech.

*But that's not endorsement. None of the hypotheticals which you
mentioned are endorsements for candidates.*

Of course it is! If I say that a candidate's actions are in violation of
our religion, that's a denouncement of that candidate! If I sing the
praises of a candidate's ethics and say that it is in line with our
church's beliefs, that's an endorsement! I don't have to say "Go vote
for candidate X" in order to endorse him. For the guy who tried to tell
me the difference between a "wedding" and a "marriage," I'm surprised
you have a hard time seeing what an "endorsement" actually looks like.

And you're wrong that pastors are allowed to speak about candidates. The
Johnson Amendment is very clear about this: pastors cannot "participate
in, or intervene in (including the publishing or distributing of
statements), any political campaign on behalf of or in opposition to any
candidate for public office." Don't you think that singing the praises
of a candidate is "intervening?" Actually, it doesn't matter whether or
not you think it's intervening. If the IRS thinks it's intervening, that
church risks losing their tax-exempt status. Since the amendment passed,
the IRS has steadfastly maintained that any speech by churches that
***could*** be construed as supporting or opposing candidates for
government office, including sermons from the pulpit, can result in loss
of tax exemption.

Churches have done this for DECADES before the Johnson Amendment.
Churches had been some of the biggest participants in the voice of the
people speaking out against injustice. Child labor rights, civil rights,
ending segregation, churches were right out there, at the forefront of
most of the significant societal and governmental changes in history.

Oddly though, despite thousands of sermons every year directly or
indirectly endorsing candidates, the IRS has never once withdrew
tax-exempt status from a church. Why do you think that is?
