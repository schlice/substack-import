**Is it illegal to screenshot someone in a group when they\'re being
racist? Can you use that as evidence or is it considered illegally
obtained? These aren\'t private conservations but declarations a person
made in a closed FB group.**

Evidence of what? What crime has been committed?

I do hate to break it to you, but it's not illegal to be racist. It may
be terribly misguided, but it's not illegal.

The First Amendment protects your right to say racist things.

That doesn't mean that there shouldn't be backlash. Remember, Facebook
is run by liberal Silicon Valley executives. I would report the entire
conversation to Facebook and have that person banned.

That's what we do with dissenting voices, right? We ban them! Only
people we like to hear in our safe spaces! You only have freedom of
speech when you say *nice* things!

Despite my First Amendment sarcasm and ranting, the person did this on
Facebook, which does have policies against racism, so your best bet
would simply be to report the conversation to Facebook.
