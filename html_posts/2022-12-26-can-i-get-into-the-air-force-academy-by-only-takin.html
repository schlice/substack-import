First of all, every situation is different. But in general, I can tell
you that only taking honors classes and not playing any team sports
won't make you extremely competitive to gain admission into the Air
Force Academy.

The Academy is definitely looking for "hi-po's" --- *high potential*
candidates. Not only must you be at or near the top of your class
academically, you need to show proven leadership and constant
participation in either team or individual sports, and work in your
community, including volunteer activity.

You actually don't even have to take all AP classes. You just have to
consistently excel in the classes you do have, along with doing all the
other things I mentioned.
