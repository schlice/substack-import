The question contains fundamental flaws in logic.

The logical flaw is what is called an "argument from omniscience." You
claimed that the U.S. thinks gun ownership is an inalienable \[sic\]
right given that **literally all of the developed world doesn't feel the
same way**. You would literally have to know what "all of the developed
world" knows, and you cannot know that.

Your argument is simply illogical, which makes it wrong.
