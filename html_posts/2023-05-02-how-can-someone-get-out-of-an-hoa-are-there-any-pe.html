While that was only slightly tongue-in-cheek, if you're talking about a
mandatory HOA, which is an HOA attached to the property, there is no way
to "get out of an HOA" other than selling your house.

There is another remote possibility: dissolve the HOA. If it sounds
simple, it's not. You must use a real estate attorney who specializes in
HOA law to help you draft up the legal documentation to do it. You must
get concurrence from **100%** of the current homeowners. And finally,
you'll have to figure out what to do with community property. If your
HOA is part of a larger Association, this might be simple, as your small
HOA would simply be absorbed by the larger HOA and you'll just pay dues
to them. But if not, your community property will have to be sold or
gifted to some other entity or organization. Someone will have to pay
for watering the grass. Someone will have to pay for the landscaping,
and you're going to have to find organizations to take on that
responsibility. There may be some charitable organizations willing to do
it, but you'll have to do the legwork to get them to do it.

And that's not free. Not only the legal costs, but the service transfer
costs, the transfer of insurance policies, etc.

Other than that, there's really no other way to get out of an HOA. The
easiest and quickest way is to move to somewhere where there is no HOA.
