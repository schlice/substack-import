Effective psychiatric care is a combination of therapy and medications.
Being on one or the other is much less effective than both. Mental
health professionals are keenly aware of this. However, the people who
provide therapy are not the people who provide medications, and the
people who provide medications are not the people who provide therapy,
and often, the two professions don't see eye to eye.

Let's be clear: our mental health system is ***broken***. Simply trying
to apply a band-aid to the system (i.e. medications=guns banned) is not
going to fix the problem. It will simply mean that more
mentally-unstable people will use other methods to kill, and we've
simply turned a toothache into a headache; we haven't solved anything.
Therefore, it would be wrong for us to say "medications=guns banned".
Being on medication alone is not an indication that someone is not
mentally stable enough to own a gun.
