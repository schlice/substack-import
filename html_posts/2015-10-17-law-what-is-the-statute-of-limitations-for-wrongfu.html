**Content:** [Understand that you are asking a specific question, but I
can answer with general legal information for Virginia.\
\
You can sue for anything in this country. What sort of chance you have
at prevailing in your lawsuit is dependent on many factors, including
the laws in your jurisdiction.\
\
However, in this case, the death took place 12 years ago, and the
statute of limitations on wrongful death is two years. Medical
malpractice is also two years, but can be tolled up to ten years in
certain circumstances.\
\
I\'m reasonably certain, based on a cursory review of Virginia law, that
the statute of limitations for both wrongful death and malpractice have
expired.\
\
However, as in all cases, you need to consult with a malpractice
attorney licensed in Virginia in order to see what all of your legal
options are. Most consultations are free or are a flat fee. Contact your
local bar association for assistance in finding the appropriate attorney
for your situation.]{.rendered_qtext}
