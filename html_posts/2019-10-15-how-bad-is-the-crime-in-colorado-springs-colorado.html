**How bad is the crime in Colorado Springs, Colorado?**

"How bad" it is is relative to what you think is already "bad."

You can compare violent crime rates to the rates of violent crime in
other cities in the country to determine just how bad things are here.

Colorado Springs is [[not even in the top 100 safest cities in the
United
States](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=08f69e&url=https://www.safewise.com/safest-cities-america/){.external_link

crime statistics.

We know that crime is on the rise in Colorado in general, in large part
due to the population which is relocating here, primarily for the legal
drugs. That sort of population brings an increase in overall crime, and
a sharp increase in property crimes. Robberies of businesses is also
sharply up, with a concurrent increase in armed robberies.

So how bad is it? We know it's worse than it was, but how bad it really
is is up to you to decide.
