**Content:** [I was in a situation similar to
[[I.L.Mitchell](https://www.quora.com/profile/I-L-Mitchell)]{.qlink_container}\'s
story: I was testing a radar detector with my dad (who was still active,
so I\'m not actually answering the question, sorry about that) on a
stretch of road that should have been, by all rights, completely
deserted at that time of year. It was November, and we were on Ocean
Parkway, just off of Jones and Tobay Beach. Those are the barrier
beaches on the south side of Long Island. The beaches were completely
deserted on that day, since it was cold and misty. We were testing a
radar detector as well as a new car I just got. Yes, it was a sports
car. Needless to say, we were exceeding the speed limit (by a lot). We
discovered that the car can go really fast and you\'d hardly feel it. We
also discovered (the hard way) that the radar detector (which my dad
bought second-hand) didn\'t work at all. The officer brought his
handheld RADAR gun out of the car and blasted it directly at the
detector, and it didn\'t wink at all. Completely worthless.\

The speed was way scarier than being pulled over.]{.rendered_qtext}
