Republicans truly believe that government should be as far removed as
possible from women's reproductive rights.

**HOWEVER**, Republicans believe that government **should** be
*preeminently* involved in what activities we classify as "women's
reproductive rights."

Specifically, whether we should call the destruction of a living human
being, for reasons other than to save the life of the woman, "women's
reproductive rights."

Once we create bright-line boundaries around the term "women's
reproductive rights," then how those rights are managed fall squarely
between a woman and her doctor.

But redefining the term "women's reproductive rights" to include the
destruction of living human beings for reasons other than to save the
life of the woman is not acceptable, and Republicans believe that
government should be specifically involved in that conversation.
