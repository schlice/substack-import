**Is it illegal for someone to tell you how to sign your signature?**

In some cases, you may be required to sign your full legal name. For
example when you're signing loan documents, one of the documents you
sign is a "One And The Same" document. Mine says that "William Stein"
and "Bill Stein" refer to the same person. I have to sign that document
in exactly the way they specify, generally my full legal name. If I
don't, it may invalidate the document, which could lead to delays in
processing my loan, or outright denial.

So in some cases, it may be legal for someone to tell you how to sign
your name.
