EBV was investigated as a possible trigger for the MS disease process,
as have many viruses, such as rabies, herpes simplex virus, measles,
coronavirus, canine distemper virus, and HTLV-1, among others. None has
yet been confirmed. Chlamydia pneumoniae, a bacteria which 90% of the
population has been exposed to over their lifetime, has also been
suggested but never proven.

While we have yet to identify positively the virus, scientists still
believe that some infectious trigger initiates the disease process.

(EDIT) It's looking more and more like EBV is the infectious trigger
that initiates the disease process. [[A
study](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d756f5&url=https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2022/01/epstein-barr-virus-multiple-sclerosis.html){.external_link

University in 2022 proved that the Epstein-Barr virus triggers multiple
sclerosis by priming the immune system to attack the body's own nervous
system.
