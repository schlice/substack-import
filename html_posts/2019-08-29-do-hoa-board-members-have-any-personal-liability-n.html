**Do HOA board members have any personal liability not covered by
typical HOA insurance coverage?**

Yes, and HOAs also carry personal indemnity insurance for Board members,
in addition to typical HOA insurance coverage. It's called "D&O
(Director and Officer) insurance."

Board members typically have no additional exposure beyond what is
covered by the liability insurance for Board members.
