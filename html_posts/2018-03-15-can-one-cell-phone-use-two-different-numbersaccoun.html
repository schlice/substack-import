There are multiple ways this can happen:

1.  Some models of cell phone can use **dual SIM cards.** This allows
    one phone to use two SIM cards to connect to the cellular network
    with unique phone numbers. Most Android phones which allow this have
    a SIM Manager application which allows you to specify which SIM each
    function (data, phone calls, etc) will use.
2.  You can download any number of third party apps which support adding
    a second phone number using your mobile data. Note that the second
    phone number will not use cellular carrier minutes, it will use
    data. Some of these apps charge you separately for this service.
