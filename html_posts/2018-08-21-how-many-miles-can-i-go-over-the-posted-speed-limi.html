**How many miles can I go over the posted speed limit before the police
can stop me?**

(USA specific answer)

Your question seems to imply that there is a set amount of miles above
the speed limit within which the police cannot stop you.

This is untrue.

If the speed limit is 55 and you are clocked at 56, you can be stopped
and ticketed, however unlikely that scenario is.

It's unlikely because your speedometer in your car could potentially be
off by a few miles, and the speed measuring equipment could similarly be
off by a few miles. So **realistically**, combining those two "fudge
factors" we could have a difference of up to 5 miles an hour.

Therefore, it's *unlikely* that the police would stop you if you were
within 5 miles an hour of the posted speed limit.

It's not *impossible*, however. For example, school zones are
**tightly** controlled. Any speed over the speed limit in a school zone
can be stopped. Yes, doing 25 in a 20 mile an hour school zone can, and
is routinely, stopped, especially because fines in school zones are
double the standard fine for that speed. This is also true for
construction zones.
