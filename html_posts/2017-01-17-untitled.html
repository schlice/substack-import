Then I think the problem may be that you're asking the wrong questions.

Whether or not a phrase generates resentment in a person is irrelevant
to the discussion. It's purely tangential. Why would someone's feelings
about a discussion change anything at all? This is a discussion of fact,
and things that can be legislated, or can't be legislated because to do
so would be unconstitutional. Feelings have no place in such a
discussion; they simply muddy the water. Unless you only want to talk
about feelings and not goals. You can't "feel" your way to better laws.

This is the main difference between conservatives and progressives. When
evaluating a course of action, progressives ask, "Does it feel good?" In
other words, does it make me feel good that I'm doing something, even if
that something may not necessarily benefit the group that it was
intended to benefit. Conservatives, on the other hand, ask, "Does it
**do** good?" In other words, I understand that some feelings may be
hurt, but ultimately it helps people and works towards a good outcome.
