Apples and cars. The comparison between the US and Sweden is totally
unhelpful.

US police officers do not train for only 19 weeks. US police officers
only receive, on average (as all departments across the country are
different), about 21 weeks of classroom instruction *before they are
sworn and* can go out on patrol.

But that doesn't mean *solo* patrol taking calls for service.

This starts a multi-month period of ***on-the-job training*** (OJT)
which is overseen by a Field Training Officer (FTO). The rookie must
ride as part of a 2-man car until they have reached a certain level of
proficiency. Usually, field training under one or more FTOs takes about
six months, but this can vary from person to person, and from department
to department.

And we should recall that people in the US want to *cut* funding to
police departments, not increase it, so they are necessarily calling for
that training to be *reduced* due to budget cuts, not *increased*.

Original question:

Should cops in the United States have to train for three years before
they start working as a cop just like they do in Sweden, or should the
US keep the current 19-week training before becoming a cop?
