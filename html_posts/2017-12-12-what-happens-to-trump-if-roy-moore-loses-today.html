**What happens to Trump if Roy Moore loses today's (December 12, 2017)
election?**

**Absolutely nothing**. The Alabama special election holds absolutely no
significance for Trump other than a purely psychological one. It's a
historically Republican seat; it would be tough to lose it to a
Democrat. Other than that, it holds no significance at all.

Would it change ***anything*** in Washington to have that seat flip to
Democrat? Nope. Doesn't change any balances of power. Doesn't derail any
plans that Congress had. Other than bolstering the Democrat playbook of
"impugn the character of your opponent rather than addressing actual
*issues,*" it has no effect at all.
