**My medical records should be protected through HIPAA. My mother is a
doctor. She called my doctor\'s office and received my medical
information without my consent. Was this illegal? Is there anything I
can do about it?**

In addition to the other answers here, if you are not a minor, you may
have signed a consent form allowing select individuals to access your
medical records without further consent. You can revoke that consent at
any time.
