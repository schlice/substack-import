What's to be not happy about? She is a woman of faith. She is under no
compunction to keep her faith under a basket while she's representing
her country. Unless you've forgotten, the ability to freely practice
your religion is in the Bill of Rights. So if she wants to credit
everything that she does to God's grace, what difference does that make
to you?

The United States is a country where you are free to practice whatever
religion you choose, or no religion at all. But that also brings a
*responsibility* to allow those who **do** wish to practice their
religion to do so without your interference.

Remember, you don't have the right to be *free from religion*. The
Constitution doesn't recognize such a right. But it *does* recognize the
right of every individual to practice their religion as they please,
even on the world stage.

And that is a beautiful thing for the world to see.
