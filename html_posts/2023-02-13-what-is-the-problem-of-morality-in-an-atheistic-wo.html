In an atheistic worldview, the problem of morality is *its source*.

We know that we should be good people, but *why?* Why should we be
faithful to our families? Who said we should "help people?" Is "helping
people" a universal moral obligation, or is it just true for you but not
for me? And to what end should you help them: Financially? Emotionally?
Physically? Spiritually?

If there's no objective standard outside of ourselves, then life is
nothing but a glorified Monopoly game. You can acquire lots of money and
lots of property, but when the game is over, it's all going back in the
box.

Is that really what life is all about?

Atheists have an innate sense of right and wrong; they just can't
quantify its origin, and why we all have it, regardless of how we were
raised.

Everyone knows that love is better than hate. Everyone knows courage is
better than cowardice. University of Texas at Austin professor J.
Budziszewski writes, "Everyone knows certain principles. There is no
land where murder is virtue and gratitude vice." C. S. Lewis wrote,
"Think of a country where people were admired for running away in
battle, or where a man felt proud of double-crossing all the people who
had been kindest to him. You might just as well try to imagine a country
where two and two made five."

We call those things that "everyone knows" the *moral law*. And the fact
that the moral law has been prescribed on the minds and hearts of every
human being implies the fact that there is a moral law prescriber. Every
prescription has a prescriber. The moral law is no different. The moral
law goes like this:

1.  Every law has a law giver.
2.  There is a moral law.
3.  Therefore, there is a moral law giver.

Statement 1 is indeed true. There can be no legislation without a
legislature. And if there is a moral *obligation*, there must be someone
to whom we are *obligated*. In other words, everyone knows there are
absolute moral obligations. An absolute moral obligation is something
that is binding on all people, at all times, in all places. And an
absolute Moral Law implies an absolute Moral Law Giver.
