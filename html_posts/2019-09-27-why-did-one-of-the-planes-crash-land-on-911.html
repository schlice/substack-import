**Why did one of the planes crash land on 9/11?**

The fourth aircraft, which was purportedly headed for the White House or
the Capitol Building, was interrupted in flight. The passengers
attempted to re-take control of the plane from the hijackers, and in the
attempt, the hijackers chose to scuttle the aircraft instead of being
taken alive. The plane crashed in an open field in Shankesville,
Pennsylvania at 580 miles per hour. Everyone on board was killed
instantly. The plane was 20 minutes of flight time away from its
presumed target
