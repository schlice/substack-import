**Content:** [Unfortunately, there is very little that can be done now
on the Constitutional front.\
\
Congress can\'t pass laws which violate the current interpretation of
the Second Amendment, which the court has interpreted to confer an
individual right to gun ownership.\
\
Congress can propose a new Constitutional amendment which will
re-interpret the meaning of the Second Amendment. Whether or not there
is enough popular support for such a measure remains to be seen. The NRA
was pretty effective in convincing the vast majority of Americans that
the Second Amendment does just what the court said it did: conferred an
individual right to own firearms.]{.rendered_qtext}
