**Can a majority of HOA members rewrite the rules to require a
supermajority for changes? Originally a majority vote was enough. Or
would the supermajority need to agree to be bound by the more
restrictive term?**

How rules are changed are written into the Bylaws.

The Bylaws describe the functioning of the Association as a business
unit, which includes how it is staffed, and how votes are held. Remember
that the Association is generally (in most places around the country) a
501(c)(4) nonprofit corporation. This means that all the rules which
govern how this corporation runs are contained within the corporate
Bylaws.

Included in the Bylaws are rules about how the Bylaws can be changed.
Some Bylaws require a majority of homeowners to change them, some
require unanimous consent of the homeowners. Your Bylaws may specify one
of these, or it may specify something else.

You can change the Bylaws in whatever way you choose, but the change
must be conducted in the manner specified in the Bylaws. In other words,
to change the Bylaws, you have to follow the Bylaws. You will likely
have to get signatures from the registered homeowners for whatever
percentage of homeowners is required to change the Bylaws to whatever
you choose.

Note then that the updated Bylaws must be filed with the municipality
wherein the corporation operates (either city or county charter,
depending on where your HOA is). There will be attorney's fees and
filing fees which must be paid by the HOA.
