The judge needs to understand her frame of mind. He needs to see that
she is more apt to argue about the details of the custody order than to
take care of the children.

And whatever you do, *document, document, document.* Photo storage on
Google Photos is free and unlimited, so take pictures of everything. For
example, taking photos of the outfit you sent your child to her mom
wearing, and a photo of the outfit in which she returned. Documentation
helps to keep everyone focused on the issue rather than the emotion.
