**Content:** [You would have higher-pressure air in your lungs compared
to the air pressure outside your lungs. When the plane depressurizes,
you make a grunting sound, kinda like getting hit in the gut with a
basketball but without the pain. You exhale without exhaling. Remember
that your lungs work like balloons and they draw in air when your
diaphragm moves down increasing the size of the chest cavity, causing a
negative pressure in the lungs and causing air to enter and inflate the
lungs. So the ability to breathe is very dependent on the ambient air
pressure and an equalization of pressure between the air in your lungs
and the air outside of your body.\
\
If you rapidly decrease the pressure of the surrounding air, your lungs
now contain higher pressure air than your surroundings, and will be
wanting to escape, involuntarily if necessary. You\'d have to hold your
breath and grab your nose in order to keep that air in, and you\'d then
risk other injury, such as a ruptured eardrum.]{.rendered_qtext}
