**What would happen to the United States if people were able to choose
how much they pay in taxes?**

Government revenue would go up, tax loopholes and evasion would go down,
and people would keep more of their own money.

I'm assuming that you're not talking about a voluntary tax system where
people simply choose whether or not they are going to contribute money
to the government at all. That would be more like a donation system, and
it would never ever work.

But there is a system where we can choose how much we pay in taxes. And
it is very real, and it is very achievable, **if we have the courage to
implement it.**

The simple answer: ***switch to a consumption tax instead of an income
tax.***

Now, it's not quite as simple as just switching to a consumption tax (in
other words, a Federal sales tax), because we still want to have
protections for the poor. We don't want the poor to pay taxes, so we
still want some form of a *progressive* tax system where the poor pay no
tax, and the rich pay more than everyone else.

The answer? [[The
FAIRtax](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cbc8ad&url=https://fairtax.org/){.external_link

The idea behind the FAIRtax is simple: eliminate the Federal income tax
(by repealing the 16th Amendment) and implement a new taxation system.
It has two main features:

- A flat sales tax on new items
- A ***prebate*** to pre-refund all American citizens their tax payments
  up to the poverty line.

What makes the system progressive is the prebate. The prebate is
electronically delivered to a debit card (or bank account if you
choose), and provides a pre-rebate of all of the tax revenue a family of
your size would spend in a month up to the poverty line.

From FAIRtax:

As you can see, with the FairTax, **you only pay tax on what you
spend.** You control your tax burden. If you are a smart shopper, you
can pay less tax than others.

So what exactly would be taxable under the new system? The tax would be
paid **once** at the final retail sale for personal consumption on new
goods and services. Purchases of used items, exports and all business
transactions would not be taxed. Buying a used car? Not taxable, as the
tax was paid once when the car was sold as new. So if you choose to buy
a used car instead of a new one, you can choose to not pay tax on that
car.

Also excluded are investments, such as purchases of stock, corporate
mergers and acquisitions and capital investments. Savings and education
tuition expenses would be exempt as they would be considered an
investment (rather than final consumption).

A good would be considered \"used\" and not taxable if

- a consumer already owns it before the FairTax takes effect, or
- if the FairTax has been paid previously on the good (which may be
  different from the item being sold previously).

Personal services such as health care, legal services, financial
services, and auto repairs would be subject to the FairTax, as would
renting apartments and other real property.

Necessities like food, clothing, prescription drugs and medical services
would be taxed. The prebate would address the regressiveness of taxing
essentials, and everyone would have their taxes pre-refunded up to the
poverty line. To that end, the poor will still pay no tax on essentials.
Internet purchases would be taxed, as would retail international
purchases (such as a boat or car) that are imported to the United States
(collected by the U.S. Customs and Border
Protection).[\[2\]](#sCGrl){#cite-sCGrl .citation_link}

(EDIT) Comments are touching on the fact that this could be very simply
implemented *without repealing the 16th Amendment*. Indeed, you can
simply pass a Federal law implementing a Federal sales tax. Andrew Yang
has proposed as much by calling for a European-style Value-Added Tax
(VAT).

The problem is that **doing so** ***without repealing the 16th
Amendment*** **doesn't make anything better.**

In order to fix the problem, you must first get rid of the broken
system. We only need one source of Federal reveune, **either income or
consumption, not both.** That's called **double-taxation**. Your money
is taxed when you get it, and then it's taxed again when you spend it.

**THIS CANNOT HAPPEN.**

In order to properly implement this system, we must do a comprehensive
overhaul, including a repeal of the Federal income tax.

Which, as I mentioned, will take courage to do.
