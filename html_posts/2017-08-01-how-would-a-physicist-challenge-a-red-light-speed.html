First, you're conflating two technologies.

Red light cameras take a picture of your car if it enters an
intersection (i.e. crosses the white line) after the light turns red.

Speed cameras are cameras with integrated RADAR units which check your
speed on a length of road and take a picture if your car is exceeding
the speed limit.

Speed cameras can be challenged in exactly the same way that standalone
RADAR units can be challenged. The size of the aperture, the distance
from the target, and the wavelength of the radar beam are all used to
determine the width of the beam at the target. If the width of the beam
is greater than one lane, then it is possible that the camera targeted
the wrong vehicle. Easy peesey.

Challenging a red light camera is much harder. The camera shows the
vehicle entering the intersection clearly after the light was already
red.

The color shift argument is also not likely to ever succeed. The reason
that the lights are positioned the way they are (and the reason that we
don't have a single, color-changing light) is so that ***the color of
the light is irrelevant***.

A gray light at the bottom of the stack is the green one. A gray light
in the middle of the stack is the yellow one, and a gray light at the
top of the stack is the red one. You can be color blind and still drive
effectively. On horizontal stacks, the green light is always on the
right, and the red light is always on the left. In the US, this is a
national standard.
