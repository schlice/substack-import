**How often should you work out when you have multiple sclerosis?**

As MS is different for every individual, so too should your workout be
individually tailored to your specific needs and abilities.

The general rule of thumb is to not over-exert yourself. You already
know that [[MS

rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container} is a thing, but
again, how it affects you is different than how it affects me. It's
important that you tailor your workout to ensure you're not causing
yourself to get fatigued such that you can't continue your day.

Overall, the goal should be building up endurance and muscle mass in
advance of a period of time where you may be unable to do these things.
MS tries to prevent you from moving, and muscles that don't move will
atrophy. Understanding the possibility that this eventuality may come to
pass, your workout should strive to increase lean muscle mass as well as
strength and endurance.

And as always (which should go without saying), you should always work
with your doctor before you start or change an exercise plan, to ensure
you'll be safe doing it.
