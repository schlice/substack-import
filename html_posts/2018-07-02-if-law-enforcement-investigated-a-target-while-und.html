**If law enforcement investigated a target while undercover, but found
out they were the opposite of everything assumed (charitable,
intelligent, kind), does this factor into an arrest?**

Not at all. Only facts matter when it comes to arrest.

The factors you listed (charitable, intelligent, kind) can be considered
during sentencing as *mitigating factors* when the jury considers the
severity of punishment.
