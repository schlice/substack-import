When it comes to a former employer and reference checks, there are some
things that the former employer **must** provide in order to protect
themselves from lawsuit, there are some things that they **cannot**
provide, and then there are some things that if they do provide, open
them up to the possibility of a lawsuit.

Previous employers **must** provide basic information regarding your
employment with them. This includes:

- Employment dates
- Job responsibilities
- Salary history
- Whether the employee was dismissed or left on their own

The information provided should be factual and based on documented
evidence of the employee\'s job performance. In other words, if the
employer says you're a bad employee, this should only be based on
documented performance reports, which you acknowledged.

Employers **cannot** provide *personal information*, such as race,
religion, age, or disability status.

So now to your big question: **if an employer lies about you (i.e. lists
false information about you on a reference check), are they liable?**

The answer is **yes**.

While it is not illegal for an employer to provide a bad reference, that
employer crosses the liability line when they provide **untrue**
information about a former employer. That employer then becomes liable
for a defamation of character lawsuit.

In order to prevail in such a lawsuit, several key elements must be
proven at trial:

- The employer made a false and defamatory statement about you, either
  spoken or written.
- The employer published the statement to a third party, likely the
  prospective employer, without authorization.
- The employer acted with some degree of fault when making the statement
  (i.e. the characterization of your employment does not align with your
  signed performance reports).
- The statement caused harm to you, likely because you were rejected
  from the job.

If you can prove these elements in court, you can hold your former
employer liable for defamation and collect damages, both compensatory
and punitive.
