**Content:** [Constipation is an over-absorption of water from stools in
the colon (large intestine). It can be caused by dehydration (which is
why you are being recommended to drink lots of water), and it can be
caused by a lack of roughage in your diet (which is why you are being
recommended to eat more fiber). Laxatives are a short-term fix (and
overuse of laxatives can actually increase the likelihood of
constipation over time). You\'re looking at a more long-term solution.\
\
Here\'s the list of some causes of constipation (from WebMD):\

- Antacid medicines containing calcium or aluminum
- Changes in your usual diet or activities
- Colon cancer
- Eating a lot of dairy products.
- Eating disorders
- Irritable bowel syndrome
- Neurological conditions such as Parkinson\'s disease or multiple
  sclerosis
- Not being active
- Not enough water or fiber in your diet
- Overuse of laxatives (Over time, this weakens the bowel muscles)
- Pregnancy
- Problems with the nerves and muscles in the digestive system
- Resisting the urge to have a bowel movement, which some people do
  because of hemorrhoids
- Some medications (especially strong pain drugs such as narcotics,
  antidepressants, or iron pills)
- Stress
- Under active thyroid (hypothyroidism)

Notice that in only one bullet do they talk about a lack of water or
fiber in your diet. Most of these require diagnosis by a doctor or
gastrointestinal specialist.\

If you\'ve already hit the high points (water and fiber) and you\'re not
getting any relief, it\'s time to make an appointment with your doctor.
