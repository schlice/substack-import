**What if Donald Trump lies about something that gets our country into a
war and he acts like it the truth instead of a lie (just like he is
doing about everything else)?**

It's really not conceivable that the President could blatantly lie about
something and that lie would be believed by so many people that it would
actually start a war. Such a scenario is not outside the realm of
possibility, but in reality, it's so unlikely that such a thing could
actually happen that it's really inconceivable.

(Sorry, I hear *Princess Bride* in my head any time I type
inconceivable, so give me a second to compose myself)

Now on to the second part of your question: **Can Congress protect our
country from our President's mouth and tweeting?**

The short answer is no. The reason: the 1st Amendment.

> *Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech.*

Congress cannot stop someone from saying or tweeting anything they like.

However, if someone lies, in their speech (slander) or in their tweets
(libel), we have laws which can take care of that.

And if those lies are damaging enough, the House of Representatives
*can* vote to impeach the President.

But that's not enough. The Senate must see fit that those impeachable
offenses are so damaging that the President cannot remain in office to
complete his term, and they must have a trial and vote to remove him
from office.

And **even then,** the President is still a private citizen and can
still speak and tweet to his heart's content (unless Twitter decides to
ban him). So even then, Congress can't protect the country from Donald
Trump's mouth and Twitter account.
