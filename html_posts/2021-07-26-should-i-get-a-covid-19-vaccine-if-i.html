Depends on what you want to protect yourself against.

- There is evidence that the vaccines will protect you against the
  "variants" of COVID-19 that are running around these days,
  specifically the Delta variant. There is just some evidence, it hasn't
  been proven yet that all of the vaccines will provide similar results
  against the variants. A Public Health England analysis (in a preprint
  that has not yet been peer-reviewed) showed that at least two of the
  vaccines are effective against Delta. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was
  [[88% effective against symptomatic
  disease](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a8d9e0&url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/vaccines-highly-effective-against-b-1-617-2-variant-after-2-doses){.external_link

  against
  hospitalization](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1e2681&url=https://khub.net/web/phe-national/public-library/-/document_library/v2WsRK3ZlEig/view_file/479607329?_com_liferay_document_library_web_portlet_DLPortlet_INSTANCE_v2WsRK3ZlEig_redirect%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fkhub.net%253A443%252Fweb%252Fphe-national%252Fpublic-library%252F-%252Fdocument_library%252Fv2WsRK3ZlEig%252Fview%252F479607266){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
  qt-tooltip="khub.net"}]{.qlink_container} from Delta in the studies,
  while Oxford-AstraZeneca (which is not an mRNA vaccine) was 60%
  effective against symptomatic disease and 93% effective against
  hospitalization. The studies tracked participants who were fully
  vaccinated with both recommended doses.
- It is unlikely that simply being infected with the original COVID-19
  virus will protect you against any of the variants.
- There is good evidence that since you've already had the original
  COVID-19 (not the variant), you are likely protected from being
  re-infected by that virus, or passing that virus to others.

So if you're interested in protecting yourself from the variant, you
might consider one of the vaccines.

Original question:

Why is it necessary to receive the Covid-19 vaccine if I have already
had the virus?
