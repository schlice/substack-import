I question how the incident unfolded in the first place.

- Police don't need to take you anywhere to check your identification.
  Most modern patrol cars have mobile data terminals that can review
  quite a bit of information.
- Police are fully aware of the fact that minors shouldn't be
  transported anywhere unless they are being detained, especially if
  they are not doing anything wrong.

So either there's more to this story than we are being told, or there
are some significant details missing.

In either case, I answered the question as asked.
