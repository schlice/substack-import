**How do you handle having a chronic illness that takes away a majority
of your abilities? I was recently diagnosed with MS and it is very
depressing. I can no longer do even 25% of the things I used to do.
Trying to adjust to my new normal.**

is absolutely brilliant and I don't want to take anything away from it.
I just want to emphasize some points:

1.  While I use traditional MS therapy drugs, I also utilize
    complementary and alternative medicines. I see a naturalist and use
    supplements to aid in some of the side effects of my medication.
    Don't be afraid to use alternative medicines, but I would caution
    you in doing so *exclusively*. Pursuing alternative medicines *while
    ignoring traditional MS therapy drugs* is dangerous, and I highly
    doubt that your doctor would agree to you doing so. Diet, exercise,
    complementary and alternative treatments, as well as an approved MS
    therapy drug, offers you the *best* chance for managing symptoms and
    slowing the progression of the disease.
2.  A diagnosis of any chronic disease is depressing. MS is probably
    even more so, knowing that the future is so *uncertain*. At least
    with some diseases or conditions, the future is well known. MS
    removes a great deal of certainty about your future health. MS just
    assures us that our future *will* be uncertain, and that's really
    unsettling. However, if we're honest with ourselves, *we never
    really had any true certainty about our future health, even without
    MS, did we?* Something could have changed in an instant, and the
    course of our lives could have been irrevocably altered. We never
    really had any certainty about our future. What we *did* have was
    *control*. At least to some degree, we had control over our future
    health. We could eat right. We could exercise. We could avoid doing
    things which put our health at risk. However, even with MS, all hope
    is *not* lost. We know that we can slow the progression of the
    disease and minimize its impact, so we know that we have, at least,
    a modicum of control over this disease, and like the rest of our
    health, that's comforting. I don't know which form of the disease
    you have, but assuming you have a relapsing form of the disease,
    take comfort in the fact that you *can* do something to help slow
    the disease progression and lessen its impacts. You are not doomed
    to your fate; you can be proactive in your approach to disease
    management, and there can indeed be some comfort in that.
3.  If you don't have a care team who will work *with* you instead of
    *directing* you, get one. Your neurologist should work with you to
    tailor a treatment program that both slows down the disease course
    while working with your needs and provides you with whatever
    ancillary treatments you may need. My care team includes a primary
    care provider who works very closely with my neurologist, a
    naturalist who handles both chiropractic and nutrition/supplements,
    and a massage therapist. I bring in other specialists as needed
    (i.e. a gastroenterologist). But my care team works very well
    together and they lean on each other, utilizing their strengths. And
    they don't just *prescribe*. They *listen*. I was on a drug that was
    negatively interacting with another drug I was taking at the time
    for, you guessed it, depression. Now, the MS drug was not indicated
    to react in the way that it did, but there you are. I couldn't come
    off of the depression medication at the time, and my neurologist
    didn't want me to come off of the MS drug just because of that, but
    when I told him how much my quality of life was suffering, he agreed
    that we should change my MS drug. While the efficacy of the new drug
    is lower, it completely reversed the side effect I was experiencing
    because of the undocumented drug-drug reaction. That's what a care
    team *listening* to you looks like.

I've always said that if there is any time in history to get MS, this is
it. We've made greater strides in the last 20 years in MS research than
we've made in more than 100 years (yes, MS has been around that long:
drawings from autopsies done as early as 1838 show what we now know as
MS). I take comfort in that, and you can too.

Remember: MS is *life-altering*; it is not *life-ending*. You still have
a purpose. Don't abandon it over something like MS.
