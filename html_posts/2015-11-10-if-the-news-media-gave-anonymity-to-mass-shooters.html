**Content:** [As everyone else said, it won\'t completely eradicate mass
shootings.\
\
There is no silver bullet (no pun intended) that will eradicate mass
shootings.\
\
But it\'s a start.\
\
Many mass shooters have, in their manifestos or interrogations, praised
and idolized the mass shooters who went before them: Klebold and Harris
from Columbine, the Sandy Hook shooter, the numerous college campus
shooters. We do know that the publicity these shooters have garnered had
been a source of admiration (and sadly, emulation) for their progeny.\
\
If we send the message that you will get no fame or publicity, no one
will know you were the shooter, you will never be publicly vindicated,
and that \"anonymous shooter\" at X college campus is universally
vilified, this may remove some of the incentive some of these shooters
feel when performing their own copycat shooting
sprees.]{.rendered_qtext}
