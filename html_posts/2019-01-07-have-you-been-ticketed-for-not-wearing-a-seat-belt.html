Yep, it was about 14 years ago. Seat belt tickets were a secondary
infraction; an officer couldn't pull you over just because you weren't
wearing your seatbelt. They had to pull you over for something else, and
then they could also ticket you for not wearing your seatbelt.

I was reaching into the back to retrieve a dropped sippy cup and I had
to unbuckle to do it. Coincidentally, I was 5 over (40 in a 35).

The officer politely dropped the speed charge but wrote me for the seat
belt. They were in the middle of an enforcement campaign.

That was the last ticket I have received.
