**How can we control immigration?**

The inscription on the base of the Statue of Liberty reads:

> *Give me your tired, your poor\
> Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,\
> The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.\
> Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me.\
> I lift my lamp beside the Golden Door!*
>
> \- Emma Lazarus, *The New Colossus*

The poem says two things you must note:

- We want immigrants of all kinds
- They must enter **through the Golden Door.**

The symbolism of a Golden Door is critically important to understanding
how to control immigration. The door symbolically implies *control* to
the immigration process. We are the keepers of the door. We can open it
wide. We can shut it partially, or we can close it completely. The guest
entering the door does not have a say on how wide the door is opened, or
whether or not it is open at all. It is entirely though our generosity
as a nation that the door is open *at all*.

So how do you control immigration? You force everyone to enter through
the "Golden Door."

Seems simple, but how do you do that?

It's a combination of things:

- Physical border security
- Strict border security policies
- Good foreign relations
- Efficient immigration processes

You must have physical border security. The memes are funny. You know,
the ones that screech that a billion dollar wall can be defeated by a
ten dollar ladder. We're not looking at defeating single people with
ladders, otherwise the wall would be 100 feet tall. We're looking at
making it harder for someone smuggling illegal guns or illegal drugs or
large groups of illegal immigrants across that border, and a wall will
most certainly slow those criminals down.

Good foreign relations are extremely important as we attempt to vet
incoming legal immigrants. We need information from their home country.
You know, like the basics: Is this person a terrorist? Have they done
terrorist-y things? How many mass shootings have they committed? You
know, the basics. You might be surprised that many countries do not
readily provide this information, and many other countries do not
provide this information in a timely manner. Much of the source of
elongated times when processing immigrants into the US is related to how
quickly the home country provides us with background information on the
immigrant.

Cleaning house is also crucial. We know we have a backlog, but we
knocked it out. It takes focus, a dedicated team to do it, and funding.
We've not had at least one of those (we occasionally don't have several
of those) all together in the last 40 years, and it has caused massive
backlogs in our immigration system. A dedicated effort to process that
backlog and then a comprehensive plan to streamline the process is
required.
