Assuming that all goes according to plan, the HOA will be served with
notice of lawsuit. So yes, they'll know.

It is possible for the HOA to be sued and they not know about it. Let's
assume that the service was done to the office of the HOA's Managing
Agent, but the secretary at the front door accepted the service. The
secretary failed to deliver the summons to the appropriate Managing
Agent, who would notify the HOA's attorney. In other words, the notice
of lawsuit got lost in the shuffle. If service happened correctly to a
valid recipient and the correct people never found out about it, the
court date would come and the HOA could have a default judgement issued
against it.

If the service **did not** happen correctly and the HOA doesn't show up,
no judgement can be entered against them because they were not properly
served. The case would probably be continued to another date, and the
homeowner would have to try again to properly serve the HOA.

Even if the HOA was improperly served, or not served at all, they can
still show up and a trial can commence, even if service was incorrect.
