Biden ran on a "He's not Trump" platform, and Trump was just disruptive
enough that in comparison, what Biden was selling became appealing.
Trump's *ideas* are great, but to get Trump's ideas *along with Trump
and his issues* was just distasteful enough to enough moderates to make
Biden somewhat appealing.

Lest we forget, it was the Democrats and their willing allies in the
media who made Trump controversial throughout his presidency. They then
capitalized on that manufactured controversy to make Biden look good.

However, in a vacuum, there is *nothing at all appealing* about Biden.
He is milquetoast, inept, and is showing borderline dementia and
pedophilia. Even today, the best thing you can say about Biden is that
"he's not Trump."

So they have to stick with what works, and really the most likeable
thing about Biden is that he's not Trump. So the media and the Democrats
must continually remind you that you voted for Biden because he's not
Trump. They will continually point out just how much Biden is not Trump
every time they talk about him.

They also have to consider that these moderates who bought into the idea
that Biden is better than Trump may be having some buyer's remorse now,
along with the fact that Trump is hinting that he may run again in 2024,
and polling is showing him *far and away* the top choice of any
potential 2024 candidate. So they have to start running against Trump
now, and will have to continue to do this as long as Trump continues to
hint that he's going to run.

Original question:

Why do Democrats always answer a question about President Biden's
performance, then add a negative comment about former President Trump
who has nothing to do with President Biden\'s actions?
