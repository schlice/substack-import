**Can I sue cell phone makers like LG and Samsung for being the reason
for my bad posture, which eventually lead to my cervical degeneration?**

In the United States, you can sue anyone for anything.

So to answer your question, **yes, you can** sue cell phone makers for
your bad posture.

But also in the United States, it is up to you to prove your case, as
the court system works on an "innocent until proven guilty" basis.
Therefore, it will be up to you to **prove** with a preponderance of
evidence that the mobile phone manufacturers actually caused your bad
posture.

And ***that*** will be a tough row to hoe. In fact, there's a good
chance that there is **correlation** between poor posture and mobile
phone use, but there is no **causation**. This means that while some
people slouch when using their mobile phones, it is not the phone that
is **causing** you to slouch. In fact, the phone will work equally as
well if you sit properly as it will if you slouch. Just from this
reasoning alone, there is a fair chance that the phone is not actually
causing you to slouch, but your improper posture while using a phone is
the proximate cause of your cervical degeneration.

Therefore, it is exceedingly unlikely (almost like the fate of the
snowball in Hell) that you would prevail in such a lawsuit.
