Under current law, it cannot be considered a felony.

The only way to make it a felony is to change the law. Contact your
lawmakers and demand that they make failure to pay child support a
crime.

As it stands, child support is a civil matter, not a criminal matter. It
can be accomplished with things like garnishment, where the supporting
parent has his wages garnished before he even gets them. A court order
can do that.

But currently, failure to pay child support is not a crime.
