Gandhi is once quoted as saying to the Pope, "I like your Christ; I
don't like your Christians. Your Christians are so unlike your Christ."
So you're not alone.

This isn't a problem endemic to Christianity. Haven't we had the same
problem with Islam? Islam is (we are told) a religion of peace, but
those radical jihadists who claim to kill in its name do seem to ruin it
for everyone, don't they? And as we are constantly told, those people do
not speak for all of Islam.

Similarly, those awful, judgmental people who call themselves Christian
do not speak for Christianity. They certainly do a great job giving
Christianity a bad name, but do you let a few bad apples spoil the
bushel? No, you pick out the bad apples and throw them away.

Rest on what you know. You know that God is real. You know that Jesus
came to earth and died for your sins. You know that faith is what saves
you, not anything you can do to earn your way into heaven. Rest on that
knowledge. Those people don't change your belief.

And find a better church. They are indeed out there. I've seen both
kinds, so I know they exist.
