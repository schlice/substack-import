Sure, sometimes this happens to me. It happened to me when I was much
younger, because I prayed for laser-beam eyes and I didn't get them. And
then it happened again when I was older, because I prayed for something
that I wanted, and I didn't get it.

Then I realized that **both instances were the same.** And the reason
was because I was praying for something that ***I*** wanted, not
necessarily praying for what God wanted for me.

You see, when you pray, God will respond with one of four possible
answers: **No, Slow, Grow, or Go:**

- **No:** What you're asking for isn't part of God's plan for your life.
- **Slow:** What you're asking for is part of God's plan for your life,
  but the time isn't right yet. Slow down, be patient. The time will
  come.
- **Grow:** What you're asking for is part of God's plan for your life,
  but **you** aren't ready yet. You need to grow more as a
  Christ-follower. Once you mature as a believer, you will be in a
  better position to get what you're asking for.
- **Go**: What you're asking for is part of God's plan for your life,
  and you are ready and the time is right. So **go**, you've got what
  you are asking for.

So I know that when I don't get what I want from a prayer, it must be
because:

1.  it's not part of God's plan for my life,
2.  it is part of His plan, but the timing isn't right, or
3.  it is part of His plan, but I'm not ready for it yet.
