**Since the commonly suggested remedy to criminal activity is more law
enforcement, would it be appropriate to allow properly trained concealed
carry licensed individuals to be considered volunteer law enforcement
officers?**

The answer is yes. Although we don't call them volunteer law enforcement
officers. We call them Auxilliary Police or Reserve Deputies.

We have them today. Here's [[a job
description](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=596b88&url=https://www.epcsheriffsoffice.com/sites/default/files/assets/Documents/Volunteer/Reserve_Deputy.pdf){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="epcsheriffsoffice.com"}]{.qlink_container} for a Reserve
Deputy in El Paso County, Colorado.

The problem: **we don't have enough of them.**

We have a very limited number of Reservists in each class. Out of 100 or
so applicants for a particular class (we can only hold one or two per
year), after testing and background checks and interviews and all of the
other evaluations, we end up with about 12 Reserve Deputy Designees in a
class.

The Reserves get about 300 hours of training before being sworn. This
includes 50 hours of firearms, 40 hours of driving, 40 hours of arrest
control, and the rest is classroom time and other training activities.
This is on par with full-time deputies in terms of content, but
abbreviated to match the job description. The difference: since
Reservists are volunteer and have full time jobs, they do their training
during nights and weekends. The training, therefore, takes about five
months.

It's not an easy program, and it's most certainly not for everyone, but
it does exist.
