Since the cycle time of the weapon is faster than the speed at which you
can pull the trigger, the answer is that it can fire as fast as you can
pull the trigger.

Technically, the AR-15 fires 800 rounds a minute (source:
[[Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8ebd15&url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AR-15){.external_link

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}), which is 13.3 rounds
per second. This is the "cyclic rate" of the weapon, assuming it could
be fired as fast as physically possible and had a bottomless magazine.
We know that fanning your index finger is going to be much slower than
that, so saying 180 rounds per minute is actually a very, very
reasonable number. Except that you\'d never get there, because you can
only fire 30 (or 10 in Colorado, or 7 in New York) rounds from a
standard magazine.

In Air Force Security Forces duties protecting stateside assets, I would
routinely carry four magazines (three in a belt pouch and one in the
weapon) for a total of 120 rounds.
