<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Since the cycle time of the weapon is faster than the speed at which you<br>can pull the trigger, the answer is that it can fire as fast as you can<br>pull the trigger.<br><br>Technically, the AR-15 fires 800 rounds a minute (source:<br>[Wikipedia(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8ebd15&url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AR-15){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}), which is 13.3 rounds<br>per second. This is the "cyclic rate" of the weapon, assuming it could<br>be fired as fast as physically possible and had a bottomless magazine.<br>We know that fanning your index finger is going to be much slower than<br>that, so saying 180 rounds per minute is actually a very, very<br>reasonable number. Except that you\'d never get there, because you can<br>only fire 30 (or 10 in Colorado, or 7 in New York) rounds from a<br>standard magazine.<br><br>In Air Force Security Forces duties protecting stateside assets, I would<br>routinely carry four magazines (three in a belt pouch and one in the<br>weapon) for a total of 120 rounds.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
