**If two underage kids (one being older than the other, i.e. 15 and 10)
have sex, would that be considered legal? Would it have any kind of
legal consequence?**

The answer, as with all legal questions, is "it depends."

Not all states criminalize sex where both participants are underage.
California and Michigan both do. In both states, both participants would
be guilty of underage sex with a minor.

But that is the exception rather than the rule. The general purpose of
statutory rape laws is to protect minors who cannot legally consent to
sex from adults who can. Therefore, most states, when faced with this
situation, would choose to not prosecute two minors.

In some states, there are "close in age" laws which require that the two
participants be a certain number of years apart in age before statutory
rape kicks in. These are commonly called "Romeo and Juliet" laws. In
those states, if one participant is 18 and the other is 17, they would
not be charged. However, if one was 17 and the other 25, the 25 year old
would likely be charged.

Finally, some states have no protections and no laws surrounding two
underage participants, and they struggle with how to handle it. Utah

underage participants were found to be victims and offenders
simultaneously to each other.
