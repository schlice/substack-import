As a matter of law in almost every jurisdiction, an officer must be
trained on every piece of kit which rides on his official duty belt.

That means that if they have a canister of OC spray on their belt, they
have been trained in its use, have deployed it (sometimes into the
wind), and if they haven't deployed pepper spray into the wind, they may
have had some sprayed on their face so that they can experience what it
feels like. You don't want to have your first experience with pepper
spray to be when you're trying to spray a suspect and you get
backsplash. You need to know how to properly deploy the spray without
debilitating yourself in the process. That means you need to know what
to expect if you get hit with the spray. There is no simulation that can
accurately explain what OC feels like. You simply have to feel it.

TASERs are no different. The only difference in TASER training is that
you're not hit with the darts. It takes too long to extract the darts,
and medical crews are required to assist, etc. Just hitting everyone in
the class with the TASER would take all day. Training TASERs have a
special cartridge which consists of heavier-duty wires and alligator
clips instead of darts at the end. The wires do not deploy; there is no
compressed air charge inside the cartridge; the wires remain outside the
unit. The clips are attached to the officer's clothes and the TASER is
activated.
