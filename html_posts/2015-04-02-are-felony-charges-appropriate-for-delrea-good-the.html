**Content:** [OK, I\'ll bite and take the police\'s view here, since
we\'re all playing Monday Morning Quarterback and none of us know ALL
the facts.\
\
This is why we don\'t routinely stop people using unmarked vehicles.\
\
If you\'re being \"lit up\" by an UNMARKED vehicle, the first thing I
would do is NOT stop and call 911 and tell the dispatcher that there is
an unmarked vehicle following me with red and blue lights, is this a
police officer. If I\'m told that it is a police officer, I\'d stop
immediately. The defendant in this case did not do that. She simply kept
driving. She did turn her flashers on and wave her arm out the window,
but that\'s not what the law says to do when a police officer is behind
you. The law says you must immediately yield, not yield when YOU think
it is safe, or yield when you find the nearest parking lot. The law says
yield immediately.\
\
She did not call 911 and ask if the person behind her was a police
officer. If she was concerned for her safety, she should have
immediately called 911. I think she would have a better defense if this
is what she did, but she instead just turned on her flashers and kept
driving. The officer was driving a MARKED squad car, and he was using
his lights and siren, in accordance with the law. She turned on her
flashers indicating that *she was aware the person behind her wanted to
pull her over*, and then she refused to stop.\
\
I don\'t think her case has a good chance of succeeding, regardless of
how \"safe\" she felt pulling over. If she felt she was in danger, she
should have called 911.]{.rendered_qtext}
