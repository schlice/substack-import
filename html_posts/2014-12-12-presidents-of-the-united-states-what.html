<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I\'m surprised you haven\'t seen the Resolute Desk<br>featured in *National Treasure: Book of Secrets* starring Nicholas Cage.<br>It actually presents a (fairly) historically-accurate picture of the<br>desk, although the movie states that there are two desks, when in<br>actuality, there were four desks made from that wood. Once it starts<br>getting into the Rube Goldberg, DaVinci-style puzzle lock opening secret<br>panels, you\'ve crossed beyond what limited historical accuracy there is<br>into movieland fantasy.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
