**If a police officer is taking a statement from a victim of sexual
assault, is he/she allowed to turn their body camera off so the victim
feels more comfortable sharing intimate details?**

The answer is "it depends."

As you know, Body-Worn Cameras (BWCs) are very new, and every agency and
state has different rules around their use and implementation.

If an agency has a "record everything" policy, well first I'd love to
meet them and see how exactly they're swimming in money, but more to the
question, the officers would likely not be able to turn off the cameras.
They would have to cite the fact that the complainant does not have a
reasonable expectation of privacy when speaking to a police officer, and
whatever they say can be recorded. That doesn't mean that it can be
released to the public; videos of a sensitive nature can be protected
from FOIA requests. But in those departments, the officers would not be
able to deactivate their cameras.

If an agency allows officers to switch on and switch off the cameras
based on policy (which is the majority of departments' procedures
because storage space costs money), then policy *should* dictate that
the officer can deactivate the camera if a witness is giving a
statement. The contents of the statement would be verified and
authenticated (initialed) by both the complainant and the officer on the
statement form before the officer left, so there should be no need to
record that particular conversation on the BWC.

As I mentioned, this is a very new area of law, and policy is being
developed and refined continuously. Departments have many things to deal
with, including state and local laws, as well as how much storage space
is available for evidentiary and non-evidentiary video, and storage
policies and release policies must be tailored for each specific type of
video and for the amount of available storage space. Laws must be
created which balance the need for protecting the privacy of victims
while still providing transparency into law enforcement operations and
good evidentiary video. It is going to be a work in progress for some
time.
