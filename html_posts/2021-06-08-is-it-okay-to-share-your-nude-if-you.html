In the US, if you possess a nude photograph of someone under 18 years
old, you are in possession of child pornography, a federal crime. Your
age is irrelevant at that point.

If you give that photo to someone else, you are distributing child
pornography, a second federal crime.

These statutes are not jokes, they are federal crimes. While you
personally may only face punishment under the juvenile justice system
since you are a minor, that picture (if it makes it to the Internet)
will be there *forever*. You will never be able to fully delete it.
Think about trying to explain that photo to your future children, or
your future spouse, or to a potential employer.

My advice: destroy that photo before it gets out. If you really want to
send nudes, wait until you're 18.
