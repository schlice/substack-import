**Has anyone had a positive experience with Protandim in alleviating
multiple sclerosis symptoms?**

I had someone try to sell me some Protandim. I feel the same way about
it as I do with all supplements: if you like the ingredients and you
want to try it and it helps you, by all means, take it.

But for the love of Pete, please do not stop your MS drugs, and please
do not take Protandim *in lieu of* your MS medication.

Please do not stop, start, or change your MS therapy without talking to
your neurologist.

Finally, please keep your neurologist informed about *everything* you
take, including supplements and vitamins.
