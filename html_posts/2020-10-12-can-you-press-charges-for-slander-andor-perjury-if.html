You can file a lawsuit for slander, not press charges.

A slander lawsuit alleges that you were damaged by a false statement. It
seeks *monetary* damages for harm caused by the statement, such as pain
and suffering, damage to reputation, lost wages or a loss of ability to
earn a living, and personal emotional reactions such as shame,
humiliation, and anxiety.

The key, however, is **false statements**. Statements are slanderous
only if they are first **false**. The absolute defense to slander is
truth.

Perjury is lying under oath, but it's highly unlikely you'll see charges
for perjury in rape cases, even if the accusation is false. Perjury
charges are rare in and of themselves, but even so, courts are unlikely
to charge potential rape victims, even if they are actual liars, because
of the chilling effect that charging a victim may have. The courts do
not want to discourage anyone from reporting, and potential charges if
you are accused of lying about the incident may have a chilling effect
on rape reporting.
