**Is multiple sclerosis hereditary? Can it be transferred from a mother
to a daughter?**

MS itself is not hereditary; however, the conditions that allow a person
to develop MS seem to have a familial component.

The current risk in society of developing MS is about 1 in 750. The risk
for people with first-degree relatives (i.e. parents or siblings) who
have MS increases to anywhere between 1 in 100 and 1 in 40.

It's not all genetics though. And you can tell that through the
identical twin example. If you take two identical twins, and one has MS,
the risk of the other developing MS is 1 in 4 (25%). If it was all
genetic, then the risk to the other twin would be 100%, but it is not.

So while genetics plays a role in determining risk, there are, of
course, other factors at play. These risk factors include sex, family
history, ethnicity, geography of birth and childhood, and exposure to an
as-of-yet unidentified infectious trigger.

- SEX: Females are two to three times more likely to develop MS than
  males. Scientists believe that one\'s tendency to develop MS therefore
  has some hormonal connection.
- ETHNICITY: MS is more common among Caucasians (particularly those of
  northern European ancestry) than other ethnic groups, and is almost
  unheard of in some populations, such as Inuit, Yakutes, Hutterites,
  Hungarian Romani, Norwegian Lapps, Australian Aborigines, and New
  Zealand Maoris.
- GEOGRAPHY: MS occurs with greatest frequency in higher latitudes
  (above 40Â° latitude) away from the equator, than in lower latitudes,
  closer to the equator. This may have something to do with vitamin D
  production in the skin, and the vitamin\'s prophylactic effect on the
  development of MS. The exact details about vitamin D\'s involvement
  with the prevention of MS, however, is still unclear. Moving from one
  geographic area to another seems to alter a person\'s risk of
  developing MS. Studies show that families and their children will
  assume the new risk level (higher or lower) of the area to which they
  move. Those who move before the age of 15 generally take on the new
  risk themselves. Those who move after the age of 15 may not see the
  new risk appear until the next generation.
- INFECTIOUS TRIGGER: Scientists have been searching for years for an
  infectious agent that might trigger MS. While many different viruses
  have been suggested, including rabies, herpes simplex virus, measles,
  corona virus, canine distemper virus, HTLV-1, Epstein-Barr virus,
  among others, none has yet been confirmed. Chlamydia pneumoniae, a
  bacteria which 90% of the population has been exposed to over their
  lifetime, has also been suggested but never proven. Although no
  trigger has yet been identified, most MS experts believe that some
  infectious agent is involved in initiating the disease process.
