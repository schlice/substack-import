**How did the United States Air Force feel about the depiction of the
USAF on the show Stargate SG-1?**

Overall, the production crew did a fantastic job of portraying the Air
Force in a very positive light. While most of the details were sketchy
and very much made up (I guarantee you there are no basements, let alone
sub-basements, under NORAD), I think the crew did a great job.

And deep down, I really would have loved to work for Don Davis. I think
he would have been the best commander ever, and I worked for some
stellar officers.
