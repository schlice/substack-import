Your premise is incorrect.

Police don't wear Body-Worn Cameras (BWCs) for *your* protection; they
wear them for *theirs*.

The evidence collected from a BWC doesn't go to *you* to prove that the
police are trustworthy. The evidence collected from a BWC goes into an
investigation into whatever the officer was called to investigate. The
video becomes *evidence* which helps the District Attorney to make his
or her case. The evidence is for *their* benefit*, not yours.*

As an aside, it's probably at least a little bit comforting to you that
the police are recording their own actions so that they are
disincentivized to lie about what you said or did, but that's not why
the police spend millions in taxpayer dollars to fund these cameras and
their associated data storage costs.

More often than not, the primary use for non-evidentiary video is to
show police supervisors *exactly* what a complainant said/did during a
contact, especially following the filing of a formal complaint. "Ah, so
you believe Officer Jones was rude to you during your last traffic stop?
Let's pull up his video feed and see what happened." Most times, the
video exonerates the officer. *Not every time,* mind, but most times.
Even if the department doesn't take action, they will usually burn you a
copy of the video, so you can take it to your own attorney if you still
choose to make a case against the department (which you have the right
to do).

Original question:

Since people don't trust the police, the police are required to use body
cameras. Do you think poll workers should be required to wear body
cameras?
