**How was Lincoln able to suspend 'habeas corpus' if a right to trial is
guaranteed by the US Constitution?**

Article 1, Section 9 of the US Constitution states, \"The Privilege of
the Writ of *Habeas Corpus* shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases
of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.\"

The incident in Baltimore, Marylad in 1861, at the start of the Civil
War, was the first time it was really used. At the beginning of the
Civil War, Washington DC was largely undefended. Rioters in Baltimore
were threatening to hold up the reinforcements to the capital by
disrupting rail service, and Congress was not in session.

Lincoln made the command decision to suspend habeas corpus between
Washington DC and Philadelphia.

Since the suspension generated a massive amount of controversy because
they believed that the Constitution was misapplied by Lincoln, Congress
passed the Habeas Corpus Suspension Act of 1863, fully authorizing the
president, "whenever in his judgment the public safety may require it,
\[...\] to suspend the privilege of the writ of *habeas corpus* in any
case throughout the United States or any part thereof."

The declaration of martial law is generally recognized as a means by
which the president can suspend habeas corpus when necessary.
