As it is currently implemented, no, the Emergency Alert System (which
replaced the older Emergency Broadcast System) does not reach those
people. EAS requires "... broadcasters, cable television systems,
wireless cable systems, wireline video providers, satellite digital
audio radio service providers and direct broadcast satellite service
providers"[\[1\]](#jFQvg){#cite-jFQvg .citation_link} to make their
services available to the President during an emergency.

So that list includes:

- broadcasters (local TV stations)
- cable television systems (local cable providers)
- wireless cable systems
- wireline video providers (local IPTV providers)
- satellite digital audio radio service providers (like Sirius XM)
- direct broadcast satellite service providers (like Dish and DirecTV)

As you can see, Internet providers and providers of Internet
broadcasting (Hulu, Netflix, etc) are not required to participate in
EAS.
