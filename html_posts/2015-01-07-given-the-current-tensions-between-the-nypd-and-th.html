  to decide if they want police on patrol?"'

**Content:** [Police don\'t routinely just show up in neighborhoods with
nothing to do. The days of random patrol are long since gone. Budget
cuts mean fewer deputies on patrol, which means that we routinely have
more calls for service than we have deputies to service those calls.
There\'s not much we can do about that, it is what it is.\
\
What this means is that the number of police in a neighborhood is
directly proportional to the number of calls for service those people
place. If a neighborhood unilaterally decided they didn\'t want police
presence in their neighborhood any longer, the process would be very
simple: get everyone together and tell them never to call the police.
Done. Police will never be back unless they are investigating something
else, not responding to a call for service. Like I said, the days of
random patrol and officers with long periods of downtime between calls
is long gone.\
\
But they will then learn a very hard lesson: sometimes, the devil you
know is better than the devil you don\'t. They think the police are bad,
wait until the police are gone. The bad guys know the police are gone
just as much as the good guys do. That neighborhood will degenerate into
the worst hellhole of lawlessness ever. The police bring order; they
don\'t cause chaos. That\'s putting the cart before the horse.\
\
Neighborhoods have another option: they can *incorporate* as a township
or a city (if the size justifies it). Then they can hire their own
police force, levy their own taxes, maintain their own roads, and
essentially act autonomously (as long as they follow all laws for the
community organizations above them: city, county, state, etc). That way,
if they don\'t like the police force as it stands, they can make their
own. They can\'t be discriminatory in hiring practices, but they can
define the hiring practices for their own police force. If they could
define some test to ensure someone isn\'t biased against black people,
they could incorporate it into their hiring practices, assuming that
they could do so in a completely non-discriminatory way. It\'s not
likely that such a thing could happen, but I\'m throwing out the
possibilities here.]{.rendered_qtext}
