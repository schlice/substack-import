**Who is responsible for removing members of Congress under Amendment 14
article 3? Is it up to each house if Congress or is an independent panel
set up to hear and decide the outcome?**

The 14th Amendment was one of the Reconstruction amendments. Everything
in there has an eye toward the Civil War and the Confederacy. Any
discussion about "insurrection" were well-understood: section 3 was
designed to prevent former US military members, as well as federal and
state representatives, who served the Confederacy from serving in public
office unless that "disability" was removed by a 2/3 vote of each house
of Congress.

It is up to Congress to determine internally whether or not a member is
ineligible to serve under Section 3. The most likely remedy is
*expulsion*, which can be accomplished for any reason with a 2/3 vote of
that chamber. Expulsion is prescribed in Article I Section 5: \"Each
House \[of Congress\] may determine the Rules of its proceedings, punish
its members for disorderly behavior, and, with the concurrence of
two-thirds, expel a member.\"
